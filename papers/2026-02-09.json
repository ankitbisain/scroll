    "abstract": "The Betke-Henk-Wills conjecture proposes a sharp upper bound for the lattice point enumerator $G(K, \u039b)$ of a convex body in terms of its successive minima. While the conjecture remains open for general convex bodies in dimensions $d \\ge 5$, it is known to hold for orthogonal parallelotopes (boxes). In this paper, we establish the \\textit{local stability} of the conjecture under small perturbations of the metric. Specifically, we prove that the inequality is strictly stable for integer boxes subjected to small rotations, owing to the discrete nature of the lattice point counting function. We derive explicit, geometry-invariant quantitative bounds on the permissible perturbation radius using the operator norm. Furthermore, we extend the validity of the conjecture to a class of $L_p$-balls for sufficiently large $p$, deriving a sharp threshold $p_0$ for the stability of the integer hull.",

This we call the PBNF-transform. PBNF stands for Polynomial Boolean Normal Form as these families are based on DBNF involved here. In the first paper in this series, we show that statements can be mapped bijectively into different polynomial families g(p,q) belonging to H(g)$, which we call the The House of PBNF. We can also replace the connectives of logic with PBNF, as the polynomials are, in fact, a geometrization of these connectives; the systems are isomorphic. The benefit of this formulation of the Propositional Calculus(PC) is a near trivialization of the methods. No axioms are needed, no truth tables, just a list of polynomials (which in themselves are self-explanatory), the only law of inference is the rule of Substitution.",

Our first contribution is to characterize the minimum amount of necessary communication between the users and the fusion center, as well as the minimum amount of necessary randomness at the users.

Operating in the short-packet regime and focusing on challenging urban environments, we derive novel, closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER). This is achieved by modeling the spatially correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading link via a tractable eigenvalue-based approach. A high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is also presented, revealing the system's fundamental diversity order. Building on this analysis, we formulate a novel energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that, unlike idealized models, uniquely incorporates the non-trivial time and energy overheads of FAS port selection. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize key system parameters. Numerical results validate our analysis, demonstrating that while FAS provides substantial power gains, the operational overhead creates a critical trade-off. This trade-off dictates an optimal number of FAS ports and a non-trivial optimal UAV deployment altitude, governed by the balance between blockage and path loss. This work provides key insights for FAS-aided UAV communications.",

The study analyzes how the presence of natural predators acts as a biological control mechanism to regulate the vector population and, consequently, disease transmission in host. \nWe introduce the concept of the ecological reproduction number, a threshold that links the amplitude of predator prey cycles to disease persistence, showing that natural control depends critically on the ratio between the maximum vector density and the minimum predator density. In scenarios where natural control is insufficient, we formulate an optimal control problem based on the release of predators. Using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, we characterize the optimal strategy that minimizes the cumulative number of infected individuals and intervention costs, while simultaneously maximizing the susceptible host population at the end of the time horizon. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the model, showing that external intervention mitigates the epidemic peak and stabilizes the system against the natural oscillations of biological populations.",

    "abstract": "The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communication networks aims to leverage artificial intelligence tools for efficient and robust network optimization. This is especially the case since traditional optimization methods often face high computational complexity, motivating the use of deep learning (DL)-based optimization frameworks. In this context, this paper considers a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple users simultaneously through transmit beamforming in downlink mode. To account for robustness, this work proposes an uncertainty-injected deep unfolded fractional programming (UI-DUFP) framework for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization under imperfect channel conditions. The proposed method unfolds fractional programming (FP) iterations into trainable neural network layers refined by projected gradient descent (PGD) steps, while robustness is introduced by injecting sampled channel uncertainties during training and optimizing a quantile-based objective. Simulation results show that the proposed UI-DUFP achieves higher WSR and improved robustness compared to classical weighted minimum mean square error, FP, and DL baselines, while maintaining low inference time and good scalability. These findings highlight the potential of deep unfolding combined with uncertainty-aware training as a powerful approach for robust optimization in 6G networks.",

Instead of classical continuous linear functionals, we introduce closed convex processes -- set-valued mappings whose graphs are closed convex cones -- as generalized Lagrange multipliers. This geometric framework extends separation principles beyond convexity and differentiability. We establish the existence of multiplier processes under verifiable assumptions, including Lipschitz regularity at a reference point, the existence of a bounded base of the ordering cone, and a nondegeneracy condition ensuring proper isolation of optimal values. These processes preserve global optimality: nondominated (respectively, minimal) solutions of the primal problem remain nondominated (respectively, minimal) in the penalized problem. In the scalar case, we obtain a one-to-one correspondence between multiplier processes and lower semicontinuous sublinear functions, yielding exact penalty formulations without additional constraint qualifications. An infinite-dimensional example shows that interiority conditions on the ordering cone, while sufficient, are not necessary. Applications to set-valued vector equilibrium problems are also discussed.",

D-ripALM adopts a double-loop distributed optimization framework that accommodates a wide range of inner solvers, enabling efficient treatment of both smooth and nonsmooth objectives. In contrast to existing double-loop distributed augmented Lagrangian methods, D-ripALM employs a relative-type error criterion to regulate the switching between inner and outer iterations, resulting in a more practical and tuning-friendly algorithmic framework with enhanced numerical robustness. Moreover, we establish rigorous convergence guarantees for D-ripALM under general convexity assumptions, without requiring smoothness or strong convexity conditions commonly imposed in the distributed optimization literature. Numerical experiments further demonstrate the tuning-friendly nature of D-ripALM and its efficiency in attaining high-precision solutions with fewer communication rounds.",

    "abstract": "Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) self-dual codes are of significant theoretical and practical importance. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are the most prominent MDS codes. Correspondingly there have been many research on constructions of Euclidean self-dual MDS codes by using GRS codes. However, the study on Hermitian self-dual GRS codes is relatively limited. Since Hermitian self-dual GRS codes do not exist for $n>q+1$, this paper is devoted to an investigation of GRS codes in the case where $n\\le q+1$. First, we prove that when $n\\leq q+1$, there are only two classes of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes, confirming the conjecture in [13] and providing its proof simultaneously. Second, we present two explicit construction methods. Thus, the existence and construction of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes are fully solved.",

We establish a universal approximation theorem for this architecture and analyze its approximation properties in terms of locality and regularity in Bessel potential spaces.\n  To complement the theoretical results, we conduct numerical experiments on representative targets exhibiting sharp transition layers or pointwise loss of higher-order regularity. The experiments focus on the spatial structure of approximation errors and on regularity-sensitive quantities, in particular the convergence of Zygmund-type seminorms. The results show that the proposed multiplicative architecture yields residual error structures that are more tightly aligned with regions of reduced regularity and exhibits more stable convergence in regularity-sensitive metrics.\n  These results demonstrate that adopting a multiplicative representation format has concrete implications for the localization and regularity behavior of neural network approximations, providing a direct connection between architectural design and analytical properties of the approximating functions.",

    "abstract": "For any beta-shift $(X_\u03b2,\u03c3)$ on two symbols, i.e., the symbolic coding of the beta-map for $1<\u03b2\\leq2$, we give an exact formula for the Hausdorff dimension $\\dim_{H} \u039b_{\u03b1(t)}$ as a function of $t\\in\\mathbb{R}$, where $\u039b_\u03b1$ denotes the frequency set of the digit $1$ defined by \\[\u039b_\u03b1=\\Biggl\\{(x_i)_{i=1}^\\infty\\in X_\u03b2;\\ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i=\u03b1\\Biggr\\}\\] for $\u03b1\\in[0,1]$ and $\u03b1(t)$ is an explicit function related to the quasi-greedy expansion of $1$.

These formulae can be applied not only to the leading eigenvalue but also to the other isolated eigenvalues of $\\mathcal{L}_t$, which yields a precise spectral decomposition of $\\mathcal{L}_t$. As a further application, we investigate the distribution function of the push-forward of the eigenmeasure corresponding to $\u03bb_t$ by the inverse map of the coding map. We show that the distribution function after a change of variables for $t$ is equal to the Lebesgue singular function if $\u03b2=2$ and satisfies an analogy of the Hata-Yamaguchi formula, which yields a generalization of the Takagi function for beta-expansions with the base $1<\u03b2<2$.",

In particular, we focus on the Hurwitz-type case, since Hurwitz multiple zeta functions can be expressed as linear combinations of the classical Hurwitz zeta function, which allows us to apply known results on the mean values and asymptotic behavior of the latter almost directly. Moreover, it can be shown that Hurwitz-type and Barnes-type multiple zeta functions have the same order under certain conditions. This fact enables us to investigate the mean values and growth of Barnes multiple zeta functions, which are otherwise difficult to evaluate, by using the results for Hurwitz multiple zeta functions.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid power trains (HPT) run on multiple energy sources, often involving energy storage systems/batteries (ESS). As a result, the risk of battery degradation and the reliability of energy storage elements pose a major challenge in designing an energy-efficient hybrid power train. This paper presents an energy management strategy that adaptively splits power demand between the engine and the battery pack in a hybrid power train taking into account the battery degradation. Incorporating the battery degradation model directly into the underlying optimization problem is challenging on multiple fronts: 1) Any reasonable degradation model will, due to its complexity, result in a complicated optimization problem that is impractical for real-time implementation 2) the models contain a lot of time-varying parameters that can only be determined through destructive experimental procedures. As a result, it is essential to devise heuristics that reasonably capture the degradation per usage of the batteries. One such heuristic considered in this paper is the absolute power extracted from the battery. A distributed model predictive strategy is then developed to coordinate the power split to maximize efficiency while mitigating the failure risk due to battery degradation. The designed EM strategy is demonstrated through a realistic simulation of three different hybrid power trains: hybrid road vehicles (for example: a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)), hybrid surface vehicles (for example: dynamically positioned hybrid ships (DPS)), and hybrid aerial vehicles (for example: hybrid electric aircraft (HEA)). The results show the effectiveness of the energy management strategy in managing battery degradation.",

Then, using the port-Hamiltonian structure of the plant, we show that the MPC-type feedback law is indeed a structure-preserving interconnection of two port-Hamiltonian systems.

For regular graphs, this implies proper edge-weightings for arithmetic progressions $\\{a,b,c\\}$ via affine transformation, but not for general triples due to the spacing-ratio preservation property of affine maps. We prove that every $k$-regular graph with $k\\ge 2$ is universally $3$-edge-weightable. This establishes proper edge-weightings for all triples $\\{a,b,c\\}$, not just arithmetic progressions, showing that regular graphs satisfy a strictly stronger weighting property than what follows from the 1-2-3 Conjecture alone.

In addition, we complement this analysis by comparing uniform catastrophes with binomial and geometric catastrophes in models with dispersion and no spatial restrictions.

Previous work shows that, in the general case, the uniform value may fail to exist, and, even when it does, there need not exist an algorithm to compute or approximate it. Therefore, we consider the \\emph{Doeblin condition} in hidden stochastic games, requiring that, after a sufficiently long time, the posterior beliefs have a uniformly positive probability of resetting to one of finitely many neighborhoods in the belief space. We prove the existence of the uniform value and provide an algorithm to approximate it. We identify sufficient conditions, namely \\emph{ergodicity} in the blind setting (when the signal is uninformative) and \\emph{primitivity} in the hidden setting (when there are multiple signals).

We obtain a sharp global uniform distance estimate from a convex function to the class of unimodular convex quadratic polynomials in terms of the total variation of its Monge-Amp\u00e8re defect measure relative to Lebesgue measure. The estimate has an explicit optimal constant, and the inequality is strict in the regime of positive finite defect mass. In this regime we further prove asymptotic rigidity at infinity: every such convex function admits a unique quadratic asymptote with an explicit convergence rate, and satisfies a sharp affine invariant global Alexandrov estimate with equality if and only if the function solves the isolated singularity problem or the hyperplane obstacle problem. Standard subsolution methods are not well suited to this measure-theoretic setting and typically do not yield sharp constants, while the sharp Alexandrov estimates developed in our earlier work [19] play a central role here.\n  As an application, for entire solutions of Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations with multiple (possibly infinitely many) isolated singularities, we give an explicit quantitative mass-separation condition ensuring strict convexity and hence smoothness away from the set of the isolated singularities.",

One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code. The approach can be used with any known or future construction for containing metastability of the inputs. We conjecture that careful design based on existing techniques can lead to significant latency reduction.",

As a consequence, the number of EA-equivalence classes is asymptotically equal to the naive estimate, namely the total number of functions divided by the size of the EA-group, with vanishing relative error. Furthermore, we derive upper bounds on collision probabilities for both extended-affine and CCZ equivalences. For EA-equivalence, we leverage the trivial-stabilizer result to establish a matching lower bound, yielding a tight asymptotic formula that shows two independently sampled functions are EA-equivalent with super-exponentially small probability. The results validate random sampling strategies for cryptographic primitive design and show that functions with nontrivial EA-symmetries form an exponentially rare subset.",

Such a formula should be useful for studying the automorphic spectrum of these symmetric spaces and the deep links between linear periods and special values of standard $L$-functions at their center of symmetry. Indeed, our formula yields an identity between spectral distributions, which generalize relative characters built on linear periods, and geometric distributions, which are an extension of relative orbital integrals. We show that the spectral distributions are, in a certain sense, asymptotic to truncated integrals of the components of the automorphic kernel associated with a cuspidal datum: this provides a handle on these distributions and has allowed, in a companion paper, to express some of these distributions in the form of a weighted relative character. The geometric distributions attached to \"regular semi-simple\" geometric data are expressed as weighted relative orbital integrals. In general, for non-regular geometric data, we introduce a procedure of descent to the centralizer, which allows us to express any geometric distribution in terms of the nilpotent contribution of infinitesimal trace formulas studied in previous papers.",

We show that this exponent is not optimal in the small-discrepancy regime once one of the functions is non-degenerate in the sense of having Monge-Amp\u00e8re density bounded above and below by two positive constants.\n  We prove sharp quantitative estimates comparing two convex functions by the total variation of the difference of their Monge-Amp\u00e8re measures: in dimensions $n\\ge 3$ the optimal dependence is quadratic in the natural mass scale, while in dimension $n=2$ the optimal dependence contains a logarithmic correction. These rates are shown to be optimal for all small discrepancies.\n  A key structural ingredient is a characterization of extremizers. We identify the pointwise minimizers and maximizers in the admissible class and prove that they are realized, respectively, by solutions to Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations with an isolated singularity and by solutions to Monge-Amp\u00e8re equations with a linear obstacle. This extremal description reduces the sharp estimates to a precise asymptotic analysis of these two model configurations.\n  Assuming further that the domain and the non-degenerate reference function are $C^{2,\u03b1}$ and uniformly convex, we obtain sharp pointwise two-sided asymptotics at interior points with explicit leading constants. Finally, in dimensions $n\\ge 3$ we establish a stability phenomenon: if the pointwise estimate is nearly saturated, then the measure discrepancy must concentrate near the point at the natural scale, quantifying rigidity of almost-extremal configurations.",

This setting reflects realistic applications where only a limited number of sensors are available. We also study a variant of the above pointwise tracking control problem where the cost is incorporated with a terminal time pointwise tracking term. The main mathematical difficulty arises from the low regularity of the cost functional due to the pointwise evaluation of the state variables. We prove the existence of strong solutions, establish the existence of an optimal control, and the differentiability of the control to state mapping. We define the adjoint system using a transposition method to characterise optimal control. Moreover, a first-order necessary optimality condition is derived in terms of the adjoint for both problems.

To address this issue, we develop a robust Bayesian estimation method for conditionally heteroscedastic time series models by extending the density power divergence (DPD) framework to the Bayesian setting. The resulting DPD-based posterior distribution, controlled by a tuning parameter, achieves a smooth balance between efficiency and robustness. We establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator; specifically, the DPD-based posterior is shown to satisfy a Bernstein-von Mises type theorem, converging to a normal distribution centered at the minimum DPD estimator (MDPDE). Furthermore, the corresponding Bayes estimator, defined as the posterior mean under the DPD-based posterior (EDPE), is asymptotically equivalent to the MDPDE. Monte Carlo simulations based on GARCH(1,1) models confirm that the proposed EDPE performs well under both uncontaminated and contaminated data, maintaining robustness where the ordinary Bayes estimator becomes severely biased. An empirical application to BTC-USD returns further demonstrates the practical advantages of the proposed robust Bayesian framework for financial time series analysis.",

For wave numbers that are not transmission eigenvalues any incident wave leads to scattering, however, being at a transmission eigenvalue is far from su!cient to guarantee the occurence of non-scattering for even a single incident wave. For instance the inhomogeneity generically has to be smooth for non-scattering to occur.

    "abstract": "This paper characterizes the fundamental limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) when the transmitter is subject to an artificial intelligence (AI) representation bottleneck and the receiver employs a fluid antenna system (FAS). Specifically, the message is first encoded into an ideal Gaussian waveform and mapped by an AI encoder into a finite-capacity latent representation that constitutes the physical channel input, while the FAS receiver selects the port experiencing the most favorable channel conditions. We reveal that the AI bottleneck is equivalent to an additive representation noise, which reduces both the communication and sensing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the selected port. We then derive the resulting ISAC capacitydistortion region and establish tight converse and achievability bounds under general fading models, including Jakes-correlated channels. Leveraging the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) characterization of the Jakes' model, we furthermore prove that the port-selection gain is fundamentally constrained by the physical length of the FAS region: the effective diversity order equals the numerical rank of the Jakes' correlation matrix and increases only with the FAS length. Consequently, enlarging the FAS length allows the selected-port SNR to approach the AI-imposed ceiling, driving the achievable communication rate and sensing mean square error (MSE) toward their AI-limited fundamental bounds. Numerical results corroborate the analysis and scaling laws.",

The algorithm of choice for solving such problems is the dual subgradient method, also known as dual decomposition, which requires $O(\\frac{1}{\u03b5^2})$ iterations to reach $\u03b5$-optimality in the convex case. However, each iteration requires computing the Fenchel conjugate of each of the $N$ agents, leading to a complexity $O(\\frac{N}{\u03b5^2})$ which might be prohibitive in practical applications. To overcome this, we propose a two-stage algorithm, combining a stochastic subgradient algorithm on the dual problem, followed by a block-coordinate Frank-Wolfe algorithm to obtain primal solutions.

Furthermore, to support robust aggregation of clients' updates over wireless channels, we integrate this client self-selection strategy into the recently proposed type-based unsourced multiple-access framework over distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) networks. The resulting scheme is completely unsourced: the server does not need to know the identity of the clients. Moreover, no channel state information is required, neither at the clients nor at the server side.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the joint compression problem of a vector Gaussian source, where an individual distortion constraint is imposed on each source component. It is known that the rate-distortion function (RDF) is lower-bounded by the rate derived from the Hadamard inequality, which becomes exact when the semidefinite condition (SDC) holds. However, existing works often overlook the case where the SDC is not satisfied. Moreover, even when the SDC holds, a quantitative characterization of how correlations enable more efficient compression is lacking. In this work, we refine the results when the SDC is satisfied and derive new theoretical results when the SDC is not satisfied, thereby establishing theoretical limits for practical source compression with correlations. Specifically, we examine the properties of optimal source reconstruction and provide upper bounds on its dimension, showing that lower-dimensional reconstructions are essential for efficient compression when the SDC does not hold. Within a scalable two-type correlation (2TC) covariance framework, we prove that the probability of satisfying the SDC decays exponentially with source length, emphasizing the importance of exploring theoretical limits when the SDC is not met. Additional, we determine the component-wise correlations that a vector source should possess to achieve the Hadamard compression rate, revealing the trade-off between distortion constraints and correlations. More importantly, by deriving an explicit RDF with correlations incorporated, we quantitatively characterize the gain in compression efficiency achieved by fully leveraging source correlations.",

Building on recent progress in the local setting due to S.~Eriksson-Bique, we develop a non-local version of the Whitney blending technique and use it to relate stable-like heat kernel estimates to capacity upper bounds. Under two-sided stable-like bounds on the jump kernel, we show that a capacity upper bound across annuli implies a cutoff Sobolev inequality, and we obtain a characterization of stable-like heat kernel estimates in terms of these conditions. As a consequence, we give an affirmative answer to a conjecture of A. Grigor'yan, E. Hu, and J. Hu.",

    "abstract": "We introduce soft bitopological spaces from the standpoint of soft elements. A soft bitopological space is a soft set equipped with two soft topologies. Following the classical construction of Goldar--Ray, each soft topology on $F$ induces an ordinary topology on the set $\\SE(F)$ of soft elements; hence every soft bitopological space canonically determines a genuine bitopological space on $\\SE(F)$. Within this setting we define pairwise soft separation axioms ($T_0$, $T_1$, $T_2$) and a notion of pairwise soft compactness, and we compare them with their parameterwise counterparts. For canonical (sectionwise generated) soft bitopologies, we show that the pairwise soft $T_i$ axioms are equivalent to the corresponding pairwise $T_i$ axioms on each parameter space. Compactness exhibits a finiteness phenomenon: when the parameter set is finite, componentwise pairwise compactness forces pairwise soft compactness, while an infinite-parameter example shows that the finiteness assumption is essential. Examples are included to clarify how the induced bitopology on $\\SE(F)$ may behave differently from the original soft bitopology.",

    "abstract": "Exploiting the variational interpretation of kernel interpolation we exhibit a direct connection between interpolation and regression, where interpolation appears as a limiting case of regression. By applying this framework to point clouds or samples of smooth manifolds (hypersurfaces, in particular), we show how fundamental geometric quantities such as tangent plane and principal curvatures can be computed numerically using a kernel based (approximate) level set function (often a defining function) for smooth hypersurfaces. In the case of point clouds, the approach generates an interpolated hypersurface, which is an approximation of the underlying manifold when the cloud is a sample of it. It is shown how the geometric quantities obtained can be used in the numerical approximation/computation of geometric operators like the surface gradient or the Laplace-Beltrami operator in the spirit of kernel based meshfree methods. Kernel based interpolation can be extremely ill-posed, especially when using smooth kernels, and the regression approximation offers a natural regularization that proves also quite useful when dealing with geometric or functional data that are affected by errors or noise.",

Modulating the material breaks classical properties like reciprocity and the conservation of energy, which complicates the mathematical analysis. Without a limiting amplitude principle, time-harmonic formulations are generally inapplicable. The present manuscript develops an alternative tool for the time-modulated acoustic wave equation, that is based on a modulated Fourier expansion (MFE). The solution is characterized by multiple smoothly varying coefficient functions, which solve a coupled system of evolutionary partial differential equations with temporally constant coefficients. For small-amplitude fast-time modulations, this system of evolutionary partial differential equations is shown to possess a smoothly varying solution, which characterizes the exact solution up to a small defect.\n  Discretization of the derived coupled system yields integrators that are stable and accurate when larger time steps are used, compared to those schemes that are applied to the time-modulated acoustic wave equation directly. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and the use of the approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a Kharitonov-type algorithm for complex interval Hurwitz polynomials that determines whether all roots of a given interval polynomial lie within a prescribed angular sector of the complex plane. The method requires evaluating a finite set of additional Kharitonov polynomials. For complex coefficient uncertainty, up to sixteen such polynomials are sufficient, while in the real-coefficient case up to eight are needed. A bisection-based refinement procedure is introduced to compute a containing sector that encloses the angles of all roots. The algorithm progressively tightens the sector bounds and can achieve arbitrarily small accuracy. In the real-coefficient case, the symmetry of the construction allows the real Kharitonov result to be derived directly from the complex case. Numerical experiments suggest that the minimal containing sector coincides with the sector determined by the vertex polynomials, or possibly by a subset of them.",

    "abstract": "Resolution of singularities in positive characteristic remains a long-standing open problem in algebraic geometry. In characteristic zero, the problem was solved by Hironaka in 1964, work for which he was awarded the Fields Medal. Modern proofs proceed by constructing suitable ranking functions, that is, invariants shown to strictly decrease along canonical sequences of blow-ups, ensuring termination. In positive characteristic, however, no such general ranking function is known: Frobenius-specific pathologies, such as the kangaroo phenomenon, can cause classical characteristic-zero invariants to plateau or even temporarily increase, presenting a fundamental obstruction to existing approaches. In this paper we report a sequence of experiments using the evolutionary search model AlphaEvolve, designed to discover candidate ranking functions for a toy canonical blow-up process. Our test benchmarks consist of carefully selected hypersurface singularities in dimension $4$ and characteristic $p=3$, with monic purely inseparable leading term, a regime in which naive order-based invariants often fail. After iteratively refining the experimental design, we obtained a discretized five-component lexicographic ranking function satisfying a bounded-delay descent criterion with zero violations across the benchmark. These experiments in turn motivated our main results: the conjectural delayed ranking functions in characteristic $3$ formulated in two conjectures.",

    "abstract": "We provide proofs certifying that the structure theorem for vertex sets of bounded bidimensionality holds with polynomial bounds. The bidimensionality of vertex sets is a common generalisation of both treewidth and the face-cover-number of vertex sets in planar graphs. As such, it plays a crucial role in extensions of Courcelle's Theorem to $H$-minor-free graphs. Recently, bidimensionality and similar parameters have emerged as key for extensions of known parameterized algorithms for problems defined on a terminal set $R$. A prominent example for such a problem is Steiner Tree, which admits efficient algorithms on planar graphs whenever $R$ can be covered with few faces.\n  Key to the algorithmic applications of bidimensionality is a structure theorem that explains how a graph $G$ can be decomposed into pieces where the behaviour of $R$ is highly controlled. One may see this structure theorem as a rooted analogue of Robertson and Seymour's celebrated Grid Theorem. Combining recent advances in obtaining polynomial bounds in the Graph Minors framework with new techniques for handling annotated vertex sets, we show that all parameters in the structure theorem above admit polynomial bounds. As an application, we also provide a sketch showing how our techniques imply polynomial bounds for the structure theorem for graphs excluding an apex minor.",

The user employs minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation followed by asymptotically optimal uplink feedback. Specifically, we derive a general rate-distortion function (RDF) of the overall CSI feedback system. We then provide both non-asymptotic bounds and asymptotic scaling for the RDF under arbitrary downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of training symbols exceeds the antenna dimension. A key observation is that, with sufficient training, the overall RDF converges to the direct RDF corresponding to the case where the user has full access to the downlink CSI. More importantly, we demonstrate that even at a fixed downlink SNR, the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the training length. The simulation results show that our bounds are tight, and under very limited training, the deviation between the overall RDF and the direct RDF is substantial.",

In addition, a distributed partition law is designed to balance the workload on the entire coverage region by endowing each agent with a virtual partition bar that slides along the inner boundary of coverage region. Theoretical analysis is conducted to ensure the exponential convergence of workload partition and asymptotic convergence of each agent towards the local optimum in its subregion.

    "abstract": "We consider Talagrand-type transportation inequalities for the law of Brownian motion on Carnot groups. An important example is the lift of standard Brownian motion to the Brownian rough path. We present a direct proof on enhanced path space, which also yields equality when restricting to adapted couplings in the transport problem. Moreover, we prove a Talagrand inequality for the heat kernel measure on Carnot groups and deduce the inequality for the law of Brownian motion on Carnot groups via a bottom-up argument. Our study of this enhanced Wiener measure contributes to a longstanding programme to extend key properties of Wiener measure to the non-commutative setting of the enhanced Wiener measure, which is of central importance in Lyons' rough path theory. With a non-commutative sub-Riemannian state space, we observe phenomena that differ from the Euclidean case. In particular, while a top-down projection argument recovers Talagrand's inequality on Euclidean space from the corresponding inequality on the path space, such a projection argument breaks down in the Carnot group setting. We further study a Riemannian approximation of the Heisenberg group, in which case the failure of the top-down projection can be partially overcome. Finally, we show that the cost function used in the Talagrand inequality is a natural choice, in that it arises as a limit of discretised costs in the sense of $\u0393$-convergence.",

    "abstract": "Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.",

We focus on a regular two-edge regime with a hard edge at 0 and a soft edge at x0. Under natural geometric and analytic assumptions ensuring a nondegenerate sign structure of the associated phase functions, the standard lens-opening mechanism applies. The analysis is organized as a reusable scheme: once the equilibrium/sign-chart input is verified (assumptions R1-R7), the remaining steps are purely analytic. As a result, the solution is described in terms of a reduced outer parametrix with permutation-type jumps, complemented by Bessel- and Airy-type local parametrices at the endpoints. We obtain uniform strong asymptotics for the top-left entry, with an explicit error bound of order 1/n outside the endpoint neighborhoods.",

To understand this phenomenon clearly, we consider in detail location models with Student-$t$ errors in dimension $d$ with sample size $n$. For sufficiently heavy-tailed data-generating distributions, extreme observations become increasingly isolated as $n \\to \\infty$. We show that each such observation induces a unique local posterior mode with probability tending to $1$. We refer to such a local mode as a micromode. These micromodes are typically small in height but their domains of attraction are large and grow polynomially with $n$. We then connect this posterior geometry to computation. We establish an Arrhenius law for the time taken by one-dimensional piecewise deterministic Monte Carlo algorithms to exit these micromodes. Our analysis identifies a phase transition where a misspecified and overly underdispersed model causes exit times to increase sharply, leading to a pronounced deterioration in sampling performance.",

The a posteriori error estimator hinges on an error decomposition into conforming and nonconforming components. To bound the nonconforming error, we use a $C^1$-partition of unity constructed via Alfeld splittings, combined with local Helmholtz decompositions on vertex stars. For the conforming error, we design two residual-based estimators, each associated with a specific interpolation operator. In the first setting, the upper bound for the conforming error involves only the stabilization term and the data oscillation. In the second setting, the bound additionally incorporates bulk residuals, normal flux jumps, and tangential jumps. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed estimators.",

    "abstract": "Conformable derivatives involve a fractional parameter while preserving locality: on smooth functions they reduce to a classical derivative multiplied by an explicit weight. Exploiting this structural feature, we show that conformable time evolution does not give rise to a genuinely new semigroup theory. Rather, it can be fully interpreted as a classical $C_0$--semigroup observed through a nonlinear change of time. For $\u03b4\\in(0,1]$, we introduce the conformable clock \\[ \u03a8(t)=\\frac{t^\u03b4}\u03b4, \\] and prove that every $C_0$--$\u03b4$--semigroup $\\mathcal S_\u03b4$ admits the representation \\[ \\mathcal S_\u03b4(t)=\\mathcal T(\u03a8(t)), \\] where $\\mathcal T$ is a uniquely determined classical $C_0$--semigroup on the same state space. This correspondence is exact at the infinitesimal level: the $\u03b4$--generator of $\\mathcal S_\u03b4$ coincides with the generator of $\\mathcal T$ on a common domain, and conformable mild solutions are in one-to-one correspondence with classical mild solutions under the reparametrization $s=\u03a8(t)$. In particular, orbit sets are unchanged by the conformable clock, so orbit-based linear dynamical properties are invariant; $\u03b4$--hypercyclicity and $\u03b4$--chaos coincide with their classical counterparts. As an application, we derive a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb chaos criterion by transporting the classical result. The analysis is carried out in conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\u03b4}$, which are shown to be isometrically equivalent to standard $L^p$ spaces, allowing a direct transfer of estimates and spectral arguments. Altogether, the results clarify which dynamical features of conformable models are intrinsic and which arise solely from a nonlinear change of time.",

Subject to mild standard regularity conditions on the diffusion model, we prove the asymptotic existence and uniqueness of a consistent estimator for useful and tractable classes of prediction-based estimating functions.

Furthermore, he derived four new composition laws defined on the following spaces: 1) binary cubic forms with triplicate middle coefficients, 2) pairs of binary quadratic forms with duplicate middle coefficients, 3) pairs of quaternary alternating 2-forms and 4) senary alternating 3-forms. In each of the five cases, there is a natural group action on the underlying space with a unique polynomial invariant called the discriminant, and a notion of projectivity for the elements of the space. The strategy behind Bhargava's approach is to construct a discriminant-preserving bijection between the set of orbits under the group action and the set of (tuples of) suitable ideal classes of quadratic rings. The projective ideal classes are equipped with a natural group structure and hence we get a group structure on the spaces of equivalence classes of projective forms of fixed discriminant $D$. In each case the class group of projective forms of discriminant $D$ has a natural interpretation in terms of the narrow class group of the quadratic ring of discriminant $D$. The aim of this paper is to give explicit composition identities (similar to Gauss' formulation of composition of binary quadratic forms) for these higher composition laws.",

While $\u03a9_E$ is automorphic and of pure Hodge type, we prove it is non-interior and hence cannot be obtained from special cycles, theta lifts, endoscopic transfers, or boundary pushforwards, all of which yield interior classes. The result is unconditional, relying only on Arthur's classification, Vogan-Zuckerman theory, the fundamental lemma, and the Zucker conjecture (proven by Looijenga-Saper-Stern), and it highlights a fundamental asymmetry between automorphic cohomology and geometric access to algebraic cycles, refining the Hodge conjecture from a question of existence to one of constructive tractability.",

    "abstract": "We study graph matching between two correlated networks in the almost fully seeded regime, where all but a vanishing fraction of vertex correspondences are revealed. Concretely, we consider the correlated stochastic block model and assume that $n^{1-\u03b1}$ vertices remain unrevealed for some $\u03b1\\in (0,1)$, while the remaining $n - n^{1-\u03b1}$ vertices are provided as seed correspondences. Our goal is to determine when the true permutation can be recovered efficiently as the proportion of unrevealed vertices vanishes.\n  We prove that exact recovery of the remaining correspondences is achievable in polynomial time whenever $\u03bbs^{2} > 1 - \u03b1$, where $\u03bb= (a+b)/2$ is the SBM density parameter and $s$ denotes the edge retention parameter. This condition smoothly interpolates between the fully seeded setting and the classical unseeded threshold $\u03bbs^{2} > 1$ for matching in correlated Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs. Our analysis applies to both a simple neighborhood-overlap rule and a bistochastic relaxation followed by projection, establishing matching achievability in the almost fully seeded regime without requiring spectral methods or message passing.\n  On the converse side, we show that below the same threshold, exact recovery is information-theoretically impossible with high probability. Thus, to our knowledge, we obtain the first tight statistical and computational characterization of graph matching when only a vanishing fraction of vertices remain unrevealed. Our results complement recent progress in semi-supervised community detection by demonstrating that revealing all but $n^{1-\u03b1}$ correspondences similarly lowers the information threshold for graph matching.",

We propose \\textbf{RanSOM}, a unified framework that eliminates this bias by replacing deterministic step sizes with randomized steps drawn from distributions with mean $\u03b7_t$. This modification allows us to leverage Stein-type identities to compute an exact, unbiased estimate of the momentum bias using a single Hessian-vector product computed jointly with the gradient, avoiding auxiliary queries. We instantiate this framework in two algorithms: \\textbf{RanSOM-E} for unconstrained optimization (using exponentially distributed steps) and \\textbf{RanSOM-B} for constrained optimization (using beta-distributed steps to strictly preserve feasibility).

A group is called stable if all its subsets are stable.\n  We then explore the connection between $s$-factors in groups and maximal independent sets in graphs.

    "abstract": "Performativity means that the deployment of a predictive model incentivizes agents to strategically adapt their behavior, thereby inducing a model-dependent distribution shift. Practitioners often repeatedly retrain the model on data samples to adapt to evolving distributions. In this paper, we develop a Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization framework for performative prediction, where the prediction model is optimized over the worst-case distribution within a Wasserstein ambiguity set. We allow the ambiguity radius to depend on the prediction model, which subsumes the constant-radius formulation as a special case. By leveraging strong duality, the intractable robust objective is reformulated as a computationally tractable minimization problem. Based on this formulation, we develop distributionally robust repeated risk minimization (DR-RRM) and repeated gradient descent (DR-RGD), to iteratively find an equilibrium between distributional shifts and model retraining. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that, under standard regularity conditions, both algorithms converge to a unique robust performative stable point. Our analysis explicitly accounts for inner-loop approximation errors and shows convergence to a neighborhood of the stable point in inexact settings. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on the suboptimality gap between the stable point and the global performative optimum. Finally, numerical simulations of a dynamic credit scoring problem demonstrate the efficacy of the method.",

    "abstract": "Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.",

We consider a one-parameter monotone family of initial distributions for the population such that for small values of the parameter, the corresponding population density gets extinct as time passes, whereas for large values of them, the solutions exhibit a different behavior. We are interested in the intermediate set of values for the parameters, which are called threshold parameters. We prove the existence of a sharp transition between these two asymptotic dynamics; that is, there exists exactly one threshold value when the age-dependent birth rate of the population has compact support, utilizing the theory of monotone dynamical systems. The case when the birth rate is non-compactly supported is more intricate to deal with, as has been observed in several works, even if the nonlinear birth function is monostable. Nevertheless, the approach used in the present work turns out to be effective to handle a particular birth rate with noncompact support by translating the dynamics of the age-structured model into an integro-differential system.",

This behaviour is governed by the comparison between $\u03c6(t)$ and $t^2$ near $0$:  the norms remain bounded when $\u03c6\\asymp t^2$, tend to $0$ when $\u03c6=o(t^2)$, and diverge to $+\\infty$ when $t^2=o(\u03c6(t))$. A key ingredient in the proof is the qualitative limit $\\sup_{j\\ge0}|\\widehat{B^k}(j)|\\to0$ as $k\\to\\infty$. As an application of the simultaneous approximation lemma, we derive the existence of functions in $\\ell_a^\u03c6$ with universal properties, including Menshov universality of Taylor partial sums and universality with respect to radial boundary limits.",

    "abstract": "Projections of finite dimensional sets and their measures are investigated in infinite-dimensional power measure spaces. The starting point is the known algebraic formula, expressing \\ the $y$-projection of a finite-dimensional set $a$ as a Boolean supremum of certain finite geometrical transformations of $a$ in the infinite-dimensional power space. This Boolean supremum somewhat unusual in classical measure theory because, it is different, in general, from the usual union of sets. The paper investigates the problem whether the power measure in the infinite-dimensional measure space is continuous with respect to the forementioned Boolean supremum. If so, then this continuity leads to a simple formula for calculating the measure of the projection of $a.$ It is shown that the answer concerning this continuity is affirmative for discrete measures but false for the Lebesgue measure, for example. However, it is proved that if the concept of the $y$-projection of $a$ is replaced by that of the so-called \\textit{strong} $y$-\\textit{projection} of $a,$ then the Lebesgue measure becomes continuous in this context and the value of the corresponding real supremum is exactly the measure of the foregoing strong $y $-projection.

    "abstract": "Deep learning-based hybrid iterative methods (DL-HIMs) integrate classical numerical solvers with neural operators, utilizing their complementary spectral biases to accelerate convergence. Despite this promise, many DL-HIMs stagnate at false fixed points where neural updates vanish while the physical residual remains large, raising questions about reliability in scientific computing. In this paper, we provide evidence that performance is highly sensitive to training paradigms and update strategies, even when the neural architecture is fixed. Through a detailed study of a DeepONet-based hybrid iterative numerical transferable solver (HINTS) and an FFT-based Fourier neural solver (FNS), we show that significant physical residuals can persist when training objectives are not aligned with solver dynamics and problem physics. We further examine Anderson acceleration (AA) and demonstrate that its classical form is ill-suited for nonlinear neural operators. To overcome this, we introduce physics-aware Anderson acceleration (PA-AA), which minimizes the physical residual rather than the fixed-point update. Numerical experiments confirm that PA-AA restores reliable convergence in substantially fewer iterations. These findings provide a concrete answer to ongoing controversies surrounding AI-based PDE solvers: reliability hinges not only on architectures but on physically informed training and iteration design.",

This equation at hand is a non linear parabolic integro-differential equation which involves the elliptic operator called the half-Laplacian. Due to the singularity of the equation, we restrict our study to strictly positive initial condition. We obtain a comparison principle for solutions of the primitive equation which yields uniqueness, existence, continuity with respect to initial condition.

In this work, we demonstrate the global existence of strong solutions in the whole space case, without assuming the initial density to be small and regular: it suffices for it to be bounded and for the total mass to be finite. In passing, we obtain optimal decay estimates for the energy and dissipation functionals. As a corollary, we get a long-time description of the density. All these results are based on an elementary energy method, with no need of sophisticated Fourier analysis tools.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a dynamical low-rank (DLR) approximation framework for solving the semiclassical Schrodinger equation with uncertainties. The primary numerical challenges arise from the dual nature of the oscillations: the spatial oscillations inherent in the semiclassical limit and the high-frequency oscillations in the random space induced by uncertainties. We extend two robust integrators -- the projector-splitting integrator and the unconventional integrator -- to the semiclassical regime to evolve the solution on a low-rank manifold. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that the DLR method is significantly more computationally efficient than the standard stochastic Galerkin method, as it captures the essential quantum dynamics using a much smaller number of basis functions. Our findings reveal that despite the complex oscillatory patterns of the wave function, its evolution remains concentrated in a low-rank subspace for the cases investigated. Specifically, we observe that the DLR method achieves high fidelity with a remarkably small numerical rank, which remains robust even as the semiclassical parameter $\\varepsilon$ decreases. Within our problem settings, the results further suggest that the rank growth is primarily driven by the randomness and regularity of the potential. These results provide practical insights into the low-rank structure of uncertain quantum systems and offer an efficient approach for high-dimensional uncertainty quantification in the semiclassical regime.",

The central question is how to explicate the notion that it is possible in practice to construct an arithmetical term or verify a statement. The strict finitist answer is plagued by the sorites paradox. We propose and develop feasibilism as a more plausible view, where computational feasibility, as captured by the class of polynomial-time problems, yields a robust and expedient explication of \"possible in practice\". In this approach, the complexity is bounded by a polynomial function of the input size, rather than bounded by a constant (as in strict finitism), thus resolving the sorites issues. We show that a system of strictly bounded arithmetic, introduced by Sam Buss, precisely formalizes the feasibilist view so as to satisfy Dummett's requirements.",

Our approach incorporates the global mass constraint directly into a refined matched-asymptotic framework complemented by a uniform spectral/linear analysis.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate several subsets of $n$-copulas and $n$-quasi-copulas from the perspective of convex-lineability and the recently introduced concept of convex-spaceability. Our purpose is to determine when such families contain extremely large algebraic structures, namely linearly independent sets of cardinality of the continuum whose convex hull, and in some cases a closed convex linearly independent subset, remain entirely inside the class under study. These include the families of asymmetric copulas, copulas with maximal asymmetric measure, and proper $n$-quasi-copulas, among others. In contrast, for several other natural classes of copulas we show that (maximal) convex lineability holds while convex spaceability remains an open problem.",
