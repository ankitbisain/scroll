    "title": "Range-Coder with fast Adaptation and Table-Based Decoding",
    "abstract": "The transmission or storage of signals typically involves data compression. The final processing step in compression systems is generally an entropy coding stage, which converts symbols into a bit stream based on their probability distribution. A distinct class of entropy coding methods operates not by mapping input symbols to discrete codewords but by operating on intervals or ranges. This approach enables a more accurate approximation of the source entropy, particularly for sources with highly skewed or varying symbol distributions. Representative techniques in this category include traditional arithmetic coding, range coding, and methods based on asymmetric numeral systems (ANS). The complexity of these methods depends mainly on three processing steps: the core routines of encoding and decoding doing the calculations, the interval-based determination of the correct symbol at decoder, and the efforts of keeping updated with respect to the varying symbol distribution.\n  The interval-based symbol determination at decoder typically demands for a searching procedure. In previous literature, it could be shown that the search can be replaced by a table-based approach with only O(1)-complexity but having the side-effect that the adaptation of the symbols statistic becomes infeasible because of the high time-consumption of adapting the table.\n  We propose an adaptation process using a ring-buffer technique enabling the adaptive table-based decoding procedure as well as the replacement of a division by a bit-shift operation at encoder and decoder core routines. This accelerates the coding process significantly. In static (non-adaptive) mode, the coding time can be reduced by about 40 percent. In adaptive mode, the proposed technique is faster than alternative approaches for alphabets from about 12 to 64 different symbol when comparing the overall encoder+decoder time.",

    "abstract": "Jamming attacks pose a critical threat to wireless networks, particularly in cell-free massive MIMO systems, where distributed access points and user equipment (UE) create complex, time-varying topologies. This paper proposes a novel jamming detection framework leveraging dynamic graphs and graph convolutional neural networks (GCN) to address this challenge. By modeling the network as a dynamic graph, we capture evolving communication links and detect jamming attacks as anomalies in the graph evolution. A GCN-Transformer-based model, trained with supervised learning, learns graph embeddings to identify malicious interference. Performance evaluation in simulated scenarios with moving UEs, varying jamming conditions and channel fadings, demonstrates the method's effectiveness, which is assessed through accuracy and F1 score metrics, achieving promising results for effective jamming detection.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet they are commonly formulated as black-box stochastic systems with limited interpretability and few structural guarantees. In this paper, we establish a control-theoretic foundation for diffusion models by embedding them within the port--Hamiltonian (PH) systems framework. We show that the score function can be interpreted as the gradient of a learnable Hamiltonian energy, allowing both the forward and reverse diffusion processes to be formulated as structured PH dynamics. The reverse-time generative process is further interpreted as a feedback-controlled PH system, where dissipation plays a fundamental role in stabilizing sampling dynamics. This formulation yields intrinsic stability guarantees that are independent of score estimation accuracy. A simple analytical example illustrates the proposed framework.",

Unlike the majority of the state-of-the-art algorithms in this field, GFHTP$_1$ does not require prior information about the signal's sparsity. Moreover, its design is parameterless, which not only simplifies the implementation process but also removes the intricacies of parameter optimization.

    "title": "Robust and Secure Blockage-Aware Pinching Antenna-assisted Wireless Communication",
    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate a blockage-aware pinching antenna (PA) system designed for secure and robust wireless communication. The considered system comprises a base station equipped with multiple waveguides, each hosting multiple PAs, and serves multiple single-antenna legitimate users in the presence of multi-antenna eavesdroppers under imperfect channel state information (CSI). To safeguard confidential transmissions, artificial noise (AN) is deliberately injected to degrade the eavesdropping channels. Recognizing that conventional linear CSI-error bounds become overly conservative for spatially distributed PA architectures, we develop new geometry-aware uncertainty sets that jointly characterize eavesdroppers position and array-orientation errors. Building upon these sets, we formulate a robust joint optimization problem that determines per-waveguide beamforming and AN covariance, individual PA power-ratio allocation, and PA positions to maximize the system sum rate subject to secrecy constraints. The highly non-convex design problem is efficiently addressed via a low computational complexity iterative algorithm that capitalizes on block coordinate descent, penalty-based methods, majorization-minimization, the S-procedure, and Lipschitz-based surrogate functions. Simulation results demonstrate that sum rates for the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional fixed antenna systems by 4.7 dB, offering substantially improved rate and secrecy performance. In particular, (i) adaptive PA positioning preserves LoS to legitimate users while effectively exploiting waveguide geometry to disrupt eavesdropper channels, and (ii) neglecting blockage effects in the PA system significantly impacts the system design, leading to performance degradation and inadequate secrecy guarantees.",

We then extend our study to the imperfect channel estimation scenario, and conduct related performance modeling and OB/JO-BA designs for CR maximization. We also apply the techniques of semidefinite relaxation, alternating optimization, Rodrigues' rotation formula and 1-D search algorithm to develop efficient algorithms to solve the above optimization problems.

    "abstract": "The evolution of semantic communications has profoundly impacted wireless video transmission, whose applications dominate driver of modern bandwidth consumption. However, most existing schemes are predominantly optimized for simple additive white Gaussian noise or Rayleigh fading channels, neglecting the ubiquitous multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) environments that critically hinder practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose the context video semantic transmission (CVST) framework under MIMO channels. Building upon an efficient contextual video transmission backbone, CVST effectively learns a context-channel correlation map to explicitly formulate the relationships between feature groups and MIMO subchannels. Leveraging these channel-aware features, we design a multi-reference entropy coding mechanism, enabling channel state-aware variable length coding. Furthermore, CVST incorporates a checkerboard-based feature modulation strategy to achieve multiple rate points within a single trained model, thereby enhancing deployment flexibility. These innovations constitute our multi-reference variable length and rate coding (MR-VLRC) scheme. By integrating contextual transmission with MR-VLRC, CVST demonstrates substantial performance gains over various standardized separated coding methods and recent wireless video semantic communication approaches.

Our approach exactly conserves the continuous system's key invariants (mass and $L^2$-energy), while also maintaining discrete state-adjoint duality at every time step. These properties are achieved by integrating a centered finite-volume discretization in space with a time-symmetric Crank-Nicolson integrator for both the forward advection and its adjoint, all inside a gradient-based optimization loop. The result is a numerical solver that is faithful to the continuous optimality conditions and efficiently computes mixing-enhancing controls. In our numerical tests, the optimized time-dependent stirring produces a nearly exponential decay of a chosen mix-norm, achieving orders-of-magnitude faster mixing than any single steady flow. To our knowledge, this work provides the first evidence that enforcing physical structure at the discrete level can lead to both exact conservation and highly effective mixing outcomes in optimal flow design.",

    "title": "Large Multimodal Model-Aided Scheduling for 6G Autonomous Communications",
    "abstract": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention for their ability to generate fast and accurate answer to the given query. These models have evolved into large multimodal models (LMMs), which can interpret and analyze multimodal inputs such as images and text. With the exponential growth of AI functionalities in autonomous devices, the central unit (CU), a digital processing unit performing AI inference, needs to handle LMMs to effectively control these devices. To ensure seamless command delivery to devices, the CU must perform the scheduling, which involves resource block (RB) allocation for data transmission and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) index selection based on the channel conditions. This task is challenging in many practical environments in 6G, where even small user movement can cause abrupt channel changes. In this paper, we propose a novel LMM-based scheduling technique to address this challenge. Our key idea is to leverage LMM to predict future channel parameters (e.g., distance, angles, and path gain) by analyzing the visual sensing information as well as pilot signals. By exploiting LMMs to predict the presence of reliable path and geometric information of users from the visual sensing information, and then combining these with past channel states from pilot signals, we can accurately predict future channel parameters. Using these predictions, we can preemptively make channel-aware scheduling decisions. From the numerical evaluations, we show that the proposed technique achieves more than 30% throughput gain over the conventional scheduling techniques.",

We first identify the residue and torsion codes of the left, right, and two-sided symplectic hulls, and characterize the generator matrix of the two-sided symplectic hull of a free $E$-linear code. Then, we explore the symplectic hull of the sum of two free $E$-linear codes. Subsequently, we provide two build-up techniques that extend a free $E$-linear code of smaller length and symplectic hull-rank to one of larger length and symplectic hull-rank. Further, for free $E$-linear codes, we discuss the permutation equivalence and investigate the symplectic hull-variation problem. An application of this study is given by classifying the free $E$-linear optimal codes for smaller lengths.",

The specification of \\emph{extensional} identity types in the original presentation of natural models paralleled that of the other type formers $\u03a3$ and $\u03a0$, but the treatment of the \\emph{intensional} case there was less uniform. It was later reformulated to an account based on polynomials; here a further improvement in the style of the other type formers is achieved by employing an interval, in order to give a single pullback specification of a model with \\emph{path types}. The interval is also used to specify a (Hurewicz) fibration structure on the universe of the model. It is shown that the combination of these two conditions suffices to model the intensional identity rules, assuming only finite limits. The addition of an interval also relates the current treatment to that of cubical type theory.",

These objects arise naturally from a family of non-linear $q$-stochastic operators acting on the space of probability measures. A $q$-equilibrium measure is characterized as a fixed point of such operators, providing a non-linear analogue of the Gibbs equilibrium in the sense of DLR. We establish general conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of $q$-equilibrium measures and demonstrate how quasilocality plays a decisive role in their construction. Moreover, we exhibit examples of $q$-specifications with an empty set of $q$-equilibrium measures. We characterize the set of $q$-equilibrium measures by studying the dynamical systems generated by a class of $q$-stochastic operators. As a concrete application, we show that for the one-dimensional Ising model at sufficiently low temperatures, multiple $q$-equilibrium measures may exist, even though the classical Gibbs measure remains unique. Our results reveal that the $q$-specification formalism extends the DLR theory from linear to non-linear settings and opens a new direction in the study of Gibbs measures and equilibrium states of physical systems.",

Among them is the De Concini-Kac form, which is the easiest to define but, perhaps, hardest to study. In this paper, we propose a suitable modification to the De Concini-Kac form, namely the even part algebra, which has some appealing features. Notably, it behaves uniformly with respect to the order of the roots of unity and admits an adjoint action of the Lusztig form. We revisit several results due to De Concini-Kac-Procesi and Tanisaki for the even part algebra. Namely, we give conceptual definitions of the Frobenius and Harish-Chandra centers and describe the entire center in terms of these two subalgebras getting a complete quantum analog of the Veldkamp theorem on the center of the universal enveloping algebras in positive characteristic. We investigate the Azumaya locus of the even part algebra over its center. We also show that the locally finite part of the even part algebra under the adjoint action of the Lusztig form is isomorphic to the reflection equation algebra, which is the quantized coordinate algebra with the product twisted by $R$-matrix. Some results on Lusztig forms at roots of unity are revisited and proved in greater generality including Kempf vanishing theorem and good filtrations on the quantized coordinate algebra.",

We establish the well-posedness of the system and provide a rigorous analysis of the conditions required for vegetation survival. Our results identify a critical patch size governed by the trade-off between local growth and boundary losses; habitats smaller than this threshold lead to inevitable extinction. Furthermore, we derive a critical maximal biomass density below which the population collapses to a desert state, regardless of the domain size. We determine stability criteria for stationary solutions and describe the emergence of stable, non-trivial biomass distributions. Numerical experiments comparing sub-Gaussian and super-Gaussian kernels confirm that non-local dispersal mechanisms, particularly those with fat tails, enhance ecosystem resilience by allowing vegetation to persist in smaller, fragmented habitats than predicted by classical local diffusion models.",

The defined quantities are decision-theoretic, but have information-theoretic analogues, e.g., they share some simple but key mathematical properties with Shannon entropy and mutual information, and can reduce to these quantities in particular settings. One interesting observation is that, the value of perception without prediction can be negative, while the value of perception together with prediction and the value of prediction alone are always nonnegative. The defined quantities suggest answers to practical questions arising in the design of autonomous decision-making systems. Example questions include: Do we need to observe and predict the behavior of a particular agent? How important is it? What is the best order to observe and predict the agents? The defined quantities may also provide insights to cognitive science and neural science, toward the understanding of how natural decision makers make use of information gained from different sources and operations.",

    "abstract": "The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $\u03c1_0^\u03b2\\in H^3$ with $\u03b2\\in (\\frac{1}{3},\u03b3-1]$ ($\u03b3$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $\u03b2=\u03b3-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\u03b3\\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $\u03c1_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties.",

    "abstract": "The efficient construction of accurate channel knowledge maps (CKMs) is crucial for unleashing the full potential of environment-aware wireless networks, yet it remains a difficult ill-posed problem due to the sparsity of available location-specific channel knowledge data. Although diffusion-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have been exploited for CKM construction, they rely on iterative stochastic sampling, rendering them too slow for real-time wireless applications. To bridge the gap between high fidelity and efficient CKM construction, this letter introduces a novel framework based on linear transport guided flow matching (LT-GFM). Deviating from the noise-removal paradigm of diffusion models, our approach models the CKM generation process as a deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) that follows linear optimal transport paths, thereby drastically reducing the number of required inference steps. We propose a unified architecture that is applicable to not only the conventional channel gain map (CGM) construction, but also the more challenging spatial correlation map (SCM) construction. To achieve physics-informed CKM constructions, we integrate environmental semantics (e.g., building masks) for edge recovery and enforce Hermitian symmetry for property of the SCM. Simulation results verify that LT-GFM achieves superior distributional fidelity with significantly lower Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) and accelerates inference speed by a factor of 25 compared to DDPMs.",

The APD is defined as the signed sum of the powers of diagonal sums along permutations of the symmetric group, distinguishing between even and odd permutations. It serves as a measure of the broken even-odd symmetry inherent in a matrix through higher-order moments.\n  We applied this invariant to all 880 essentially different normal $4\\times4$ magic squares (excluding symmetries) and defined the \\emph{First Appearance Degree} $m_1$ as the minimum power at which the APD first becomes non-zero. Through an exhaustive computational search, we found that these magic squares are categorized into three clearly separated classes: $m_1=3$ (240 squares), $m_1=4$ (624 squares), and $m_1=\\infty$ (16 squares).\n  In particular, the case $m_1=\\infty$ identifies exceptionally rare magic squares for which the APD vanishes at all degrees. We refer to these as \\emph{Complete Alternating Magic Squares} and demonstrate that they possess a strong algebraic symmetry undetectable by conventional geometric classifications or link-line patterns. Furthermore, we reveal that the APD-based classification refines the classical link-line classification based on complementary sum pairs, showing that each geometric type is clearly distinguished by its first appearance degree.\n  All results in this paper are based on exhaustive computations and are fully reproducible. Our findings suggest that the APD is an effective new invariant for detecting hidden algebraic structures in magic squares and related combinatorial matrices.",

    "abstract": "Fix $\u039b>0$ and consider trace-normed $2\\times 2$ canonical systems $\\begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\\\1&0\\end{pmatrix}Y'(s)=zH(s)Y(s)$ on $[0,\u039b]$, extended by the free tail $H(s)=\\frac12 I$ for $s\\ge\u039b$. The Weyl-Titchmarsh coefficient $m_{H,\u039b}$ and its Cayley transform $v$ encode the spectral measure. We study the finite sampling operator (the seam map) that sends $H$ (or a finite-dimensional parameter $\u03b8$) to the values $v(z_k)$ at points $z_k=x_k+i\u03b7$ with $\u03b7>0$, $k=1,\\dots,M$. For piecewise-constant (block) Hamiltonians, with block length $\\ell=\u039b/N$, we analyze stability and optimal sampling. We prove three types of results. (1) The free tail forces the transfer matrix at $\u039b$ to have entire entries of exponential type at most $\u039b$; consequently $m_{H,\u039b}$ and $v$ extend meromorphically to $\\mathbb{C}$, showing that the free-tail class is a strict spectral subclass. (2) Fixed-height data is intrinsically smoothed: $\\operatorname{Im} m(\\cdot+i\u03b7)$ is the Poisson extension of the spectral measure, yielding an exponential minimax obstruction to recovering oscillatory spectral features from finitely many noisy samples. (3) Linearization at the free Hamiltonian identifies seam sampling with an evaluation operator in a Paley-Wiener/de Branges space, so stability is governed by kernel frame bounds; shifted equispaced designs give optimal tight frames and explicit conditioning estimates. Finally, a perturbation formula expresses $Dm$ as an $L^2([0,\u039b];\\mathbb{R}^2,H)$ pairing with $\u0394H$, linking depth attenuation to decay of Weyl solutions.",

This challenge is especially prevalent in industrial applications, where blackbox evaluations are costly. However, constraints can be evaluated at various fidelities at a lower computational cost. More specifically, this work targets situations in which the infeasibility of each individual constraint can be detected at lower fidelities, and where a large discrete number of fidelities are available. Moreover, highly discontinuous problems which may fail to evaluate are considered, such that direct search methods are preferred to model-based ones. To this effect, the Interruptible Direct Search (IDS) and the Dynamic Interruptible Direct Search (DIDS) algorithms are proposed to leverage feasibility assessments from various fidelity levels to avoid high cost evaluations. The results show highly increased performances from NOMAD when it is paired with IDS or DIDS.",

In this paper, we first investigate how to design SK-type scheme for the 2-path quasi-static fading channel with noiseless feedback. By viewing the signal of the second path as a relay and adopting an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay strategy, we show that the interference path signal can help to enhance the transmission rate.

This capacity can be equivalently expressed as the maximization of two generalizations of mutual information: the Petz-R\u00e9nyi information and the Petz-Augustin information. To maximize the Petz-R\u00e9nyi information, we show that it corresponds to a convex H\u00f6lder-smooth optimization problem, and hence the universal fast gradient method of Nesterov (2015), along with its convergence guarantees, readily applies. Regarding the maximization of the Petz-Augustin information, we adopt a two-layered approach: we show that the objective function is smooth relative to the negative Shannon entropy and can be efficiently optimized by entropic mirror descent; each iteration of entropic mirror descent requires computing the Petz-Augustin information, for which we propose a novel fixed-point algorithm and establish its contractivity with respect to the Thompson metric. Notably, this two-layered approach can be viewed as a generalization of the mirror-descent interpretation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm due to He et al. (2024).",

Eventhough it is an interesting model in itsef, it can also be regarded as a one-dimensional version of the momentum balance of Hibler's model for sea-ice dynamics. Therein, the stress tensor is given by a term with similar properties as the 1-Laplacian in order to account for plastic effects of the ice. For our analysis we start out from a viscoplastic Burgers equation, i.e., a suitably regularized version of the plastic Burgers equation with a small regularization parameter $\\varepsilon>0$. For the viscoplastic Burgers equation, we construct a global BV-solution. In the singular limit $\\varepsilon\\to0$ we deduce the existence of a BV-solution for the plastic Burgers equation.

Moreover, estimates of the transient behavior of solution norms remain insufficiently developed. This paper presents an approach to estimate the temporal evolution of solution norms and applies it to the analysis of boundedness and stability of vector nonlinear systems with variable delays and coefficients. The method is based on a novel scheme for successive approximations of the original solutions, complemented by the estimates of the corresponding residual norms. This leads to the construction of a scalar nonlinear delay equation whose solutions provide upper bounds for the evolution of residual norms. As a result, bilateral bounds on the original solution norms are obtained, yielding effective boundedness and stability criteria and enabling estimation of the associated regions.\n  Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approximations rapidly approach the reference boundaries of the regions of interest as the iteration count increases. Moreover, the bilateral bounds progressively approach each other and the norm of the reference solution when the initial function remains within the considered regions.",

    "abstract": "Characterisations of metrizable topological spaces or metrizable uniform spaces are well known. A natural counterpart to being metrizable for topological spaces can be expressed in terms of probabilistic metrizability for approach spaces. The notion of a probabilistic metrizable approach space is based on a well known concrete functor $\u0393$, as introduced in [9], from the category of probabilistic metric spaces with respect to a continuous arbitrary t-norm to the category of approach spaces. A characterization of those probabilistic metrizable approach spaces is still missing and in the first part of this paper we solve this problem. A natural counterpart to being metrizable for uniform spaces can be expressed in terms of probabilistic metrizability for uniform gauge spaces. In the second part of the paper we start from another concrete functor $\u039b$, as described in [7], on the category of probabilistic metric spaces with respect to a continuous t-norm to the category of uniform gauge spaces. In a similar way as for the functor $\u0393$ we obtain a characterisation of probabilistic metrizability of uniform gauge spaces. The last section of the paper is devoted to an isomorphic description of the category of probabilistic metric spaces. This problem is not new. Previous attempts in providing isomorphic descriptions of the category of probabilistic metric spaces worked with collections of (pseudo)metrics. These attempts were only formulated in restricted cases. Our isomorphic description is in terms of objects that are sets endowed with a collection of distances, where the distances involved do not satisfy the triangle inequality but fulfil a mixed triangle condition instead.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we will introduce an extension to the Collatz's conjecture. This conjecture may be seen as a general conjecture that unifies the Collatz one together with many other similar conjectures. For instance, we propose our new conjecture modulo $10$ which may be stated as follows. Starting from any positive integer,\n  if it is a multiple of $10$ then divide it by 10, otherwise, multiply it by $12$, add $8$ times its last digit and divide the result by $10$. Repeat the process infinitely. Regardless the starting number, the process eventually reaches $4$ after a finite number of iterations. The genaral conjecture studied here will encompasse the classical Collatz conjecture togher with our proposed one modulo $10$.",

    "abstract": "Utilizing communication signals to extract motion parameters has emerged as a key direction in Vehicle-to- Everything (V2X) networks. Accurately modeling the relationship between communication signals and sensing performance is critical for the advancement of such systems. Unlike prior work that relies primarily on qualitative analysis, this paper derives the Cram\u00e9r-Rao Bound (CRB) for radar parameter estimation in the context of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms and Uniform Planar Array (UPA) configurations. Recognizing that vehicles may act as extended targets, we propose two New Radio (NR)-V2X-compatible beamforming schemes tailored to different phases of the communication process. During the initial beam establishment phase, we develop a beamforming approach based on the union of predictive error ellipses, which enhances scatterer localization through temporally assisted beam training. In the beam adjustment phase, we introduce an adaptive narrowest-beam strategy that leverages the positions of scatterers and the communication receiver (CR), enabling effective tracking with reduced complexity. The beam design problem is addressed using the minimum enclosing ellipse algorithm and tailored antenna control methods. Simulation results validate the proposed approach, showing up to a 32.4% improvement in achievable rate with a 32*32 transmit antenna array and a 5.2% gain with an 8*8 array, compared to conventional beam sweeping under identical SNR conditions.",

    "abstract": "A new framework is introduced for examining and evaluating the fundamental limits of lossless data compression, that emphasizes genuinely non-asymptotic results. The {\\em sample complexity} of compressing a given source is defined as the smallest blocklength at which it is possible to compress that source at a specified rate and to within a specified excess-rate probability. This formulation parallels corresponding developments in statistics and computer science, and it facilitates the use of existing results on the sample complexity of various hypothesis testing problems. For arbitrary sources, the sample complexity of general variable-length compressors is shown to be tightly coupled with the sample complexity of prefix-free codes and fixed-length codes. For memoryless sources, it is shown that the sample complexity is characterized not by the source entropy, but by its R\u00e9nyi entropy of order~$1/2$. Nonasymptotic bounds on the sample complexity are obtained, with explicit constants. Generalizations to Markov sources are established, showing that the sample complexity is determined by the source's R\u00e9nyi entropy rate of order~$1/2$. Finally, bounds on the sample complexity of universal data compression are developed for arbitrary families of memoryless sources. There, the sample complexity is characterized by the minimum R\u00e9nyi divergence of order~$1/2$ between elements of the family and the uniform distribution. The connection of this problem with identity testing and with the associated separation rates is explored and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Categorical time series models are powerful tools for understanding natural phenomena. Most available models can be formulated as special cases of $m$-th order Markov chains, for $m\\geq 1$. Despite their broad applicability, theoretical research has largely focused on first-order Markov chains, mainly because many properties of higher-order chains can be analyzed by reducing them to first-order chains on an enlarged alphabet. However, the resulting first-order representation is sparse and possesses a highly structured transition kernel, a feature that has not been fully exploited.\n  In this work, we study finite-alphabet Markov chains with arbitrary memory length and introduce a new reduction framework for their structural classification. We define the skeleton of a transition kernel, an object that captures the intrinsic pattern of transition probability constraints in a higher-order Markov chain.\n  We show that the class structure of a binary matrix associated with the skeleton completely determines the recurrent classes and their periods in the original chain. We also provide an explicit algorithm for efficiently extracting the skeleton, which in many cases yields substantial computational savings. Applications include simple criteria for irreducibility and essential irreducibility of higher-order Markov chains and a concrete illustration based on a 10th-order Markov chain.",

    "abstract": "Pure-breakage population balance equations (PBEs) give the standard deterministic description of fragmentation and comminution. They predict mean particle size distributions, but they do not determine fluctuations, size-size correlations, or universality under coarse-graining. We develop a field-theoretic framework anchored in the PBE kernel inputs (selection rate and daughter distribution) and compatible with the stochastic Doi-Peliti approach.\n  From homogeneous kernels we derive an exact Markov jump generator in log-size for a mass-weighted (tagged-mass) distribution, with a jump law that is a probability density fixed by the daughter distribution. The generator is generically non-self-adjoint, admits a Lindblad embedding, and has a second-quantized extension. The deterministic PBE appears as the one-body sector, while multi-point correlators encode finite-population fluctuations. We also give a binary-fragmentation embedding whose mean-field limit reproduces the PBE but whose higher correlators capture multiplicative cascade noise. For a linear Airy-type kernel, long-wavelength coarse-graining yields an effective Airy operator as a solvable quadratic sector about a stationary profile, producing explicit mode-sum formulas for equal-time connected two-point correlations. Overall, the framework separates what is fixed by kernel data from what requires additional stochastic modeling and links comminution kernels to universality classes.",

    "abstract": "In frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, downlink channel state information (CSI) plays a crucial role in achieving high spectrum and energy efficiency. However, the CSI feedback overhead becomes a major bottleneck as the number of antennas increases. Although existing deep learning-based CSI compression methods have shown great potential, they still face limitations in capturing both local and global features of CSI, thereby limiting achievable compression efficiency. To address these issues, we propose TCLNet, a unified CSI compression framework that integrates a hybrid Transformer-CNN architecture for lossy compression with a hybrid language model (LM) and factorized model (FM) design for lossless compression. The lossy module jointly exploits local features and global context, while the lossless module adaptively switches between context-aware coding and parallel coding to optimize the rate-distortion-complexity (RDC) trade-off. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that the proposed TCLNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of reconstruction accuracy and transmission efficiency, achieving up to a 5 dB performance gain across diverse scenarios. Moreover, we show that large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged as zero-shot CSI lossless compressors via carefully designed prompts.",

The problem involves scheduling all tasks, respecting precedence constraints and resource limitations, while minimizing the combination of the overall makespan and the total energy cost (TEC), which varies according to the TOU pricing, which can take negative values. We propose two novel approaches to solve it: a monolithic Constraint Programming (CP) approach and a Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) approach. The latter combines a master problem dealing with energy cost solved using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) with a subproblem handling the RCPSP resolved using CP. Both approaches surpass the monolithic compact ILP approach, but the LBBD significantly outperforms the CP when the ratio of energy-intensive tasks over the overall tasks is moderate, allowing for solving instances with up to 1600 tasks in sparse instances. Finally, we put forth a way of generalizing our LBBD approach to other problems sharing similar characteristics, and we applied it to a problem based on an RCPSP problem with blocking times & total weighted tardiness criterion and a flexible job shop.",

    "abstract": "A method of information transmission using visual markers has been widely studied. In this approach, information or identifiers (IDs) are encoded in the black-and-white pattern of each marker. By analyzing the geometric properties of the marker frame - such as its size, distortion, and coordinates - the relative position and orientation between the camera and the marker can be estimated. Furthermore, by associating the positional information of each marker with its corresponding ID, the position of the camera that takes the image picture can be calculated. In the field of mobile robotics, such markers are commonly utilized for robot localization. As mobile robots become more widely used in everyday environments, such visual markers are expected to be utilized across various contexts. In environments where robots collaborate with humans - such as in cell-based manufacturing systems in factories or in domestic settings with partner robots - it is desirable for such markers to be designed in a manner that appears natural and unobtrusive to humans. In this paper, we propose a method for implementing an ArUco marker in the form of illumination. In the proposed method, LEDs are arranged in accordance with the grid pattern of the marker, and the blinking frequency of each LED is determined based on the corresponding black or white cell. As a result, the illumination appears uniformly bright to the human eye, while the camera can capture variations in the blinking frequency. From these differences, the black-and-white pattern can be reconstructed, enabling the identification of the marker's tag information. We develop a prototype system, and conduct experiments which are conducted to evaluate its performance in terms of recognition accuracy under varying distances and viewing angles with respect to the ArUco marker.",

For a partition $\\mathcal{P}=\\{P_1,P_2,\\ldots,P_E\\}$ a systematic mapping $\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{P}} : \\mathbb{F}_q^k \\rightarrow \\mathbb{F}_q^{k+r}$ is called a \\emph{$(\\mathcal{P},t)$-encoding} if for all $u\\in P_i$ and $v\\in P_j$ with $i\\neq j$, $d\\big(\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{P}}(u), \\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{P}}(v)\\big)\\ge 2t+1.$ We show that any $t$-error correcting code for a function $f$, denoted by $(f,t)$-FCC is exactly an FCPC with respect to the domain partition induced by $f$, which makes these codes a natural generalization of FCCs. We use the join of domain partitions to construct a single code that protects multiple functions simultaneously. We define the notion of partition redundancy gain and partition rate gain to measure the bandwidth saved by using a single FCPC for multiple functions instead of constructing separate FCCs for each function. We specialize this to linear functions via coset partition of the intersection of their kernels. Then, we associate a partition graph to any given partition of $\\mathbb{F}_q^k$, and show that the existence of a suitable clique in this graph yields a set of representative information vectors that achieves the optimal redundancy. We showed the existence of a full-size clique in the partition graphs of weight partition and support partition. Finally, we introduce the notion of a block-preserving contraction for a partition, which helps reduce the problem of finding optimal redundancy for an FCPC. We observe that FCPCs naturally provide a form of partial privacy, in the sense that only the domain partition of the function needs to be revealed to the transmitter.",

By leveraging automatic differentiation for precise numerical gradient computation, $\\textsf{gradOL}$ ensures numerical stability and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale settings. Under strong convexity of the ambient norm, $\\textsf{gradOL}$ provably recovers optimal Chebyshev centers while directly computing the associated radius.

Empirically, $\\textsf{gradOL}$ achieves significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency on 34 benchmark Chebyshev center problems from a benchmark $\\textsf{CSIP}$ library. Moreover, we extend $\\textsf{gradOL}$ to general convex semi-infinite programming (CSIP), attaining up to $4000\\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art $\\texttt{SIPAMPL}$ solver tested on the indicated $\\textsf{CSIP}$ library containing 67 benchmark problems.

If the polynomials $f$ and $g$ are the same up to orthogonal symmetry a natural question is then what element of the orthogonal group induces the orthogonal symmetry; i.e. to find the element $R\\in O(n)$ such that $f(Rx)=g(x)$. One may directly solve this problem by constructing a nonlinear system of equations induced by the relation $f(Rx)=g(x)$ along with the identities of the orthogonal group however this approach becomes quite computationally expensive for larger values of $n$ and $d$. To give an alternative and significantly more scalable solution to this problem, we introduce the concept of Polynomial-Weighted Principal Component Analysis (PW-PCA). We in particular show how PW-PCA can be effectively computed and how these techniques can be used to obtain a certificate of orthogonal equivalence, that is we find the $R\\in O(n)$ such that $f(Rx)=g(x)$.",

By shifting perspective from the tensor A to the isotropic operators that induce A's invariants through contraction, we reveal that the Cayley-Hamilton identity emerges when this vanishing operator acts on the m-fold tensor product of A. The intrinsic tensorial form of the theorem--invariant coefficients multiplying tensor powers--is inherited from the contraction structure rather than imposed ad hoc. We provide explicit verification for two-dimensional space and a dimension-independent proof using Laplace expansion combined with Newton-Girard identities. This framework clarifies why the theorem's structure depends on ambient dimension and suggests extensions to higher-order tensors where classical characteristic polynomial methods fail.",

We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control.",

We consider a dual-waveguide architecture that simultaneously delivers covert information and randomized jamming to hide the transmission footprint, incorporating three representative PASS power-radiation laws-general, proportional, and equal. To characterize the system-level detectability, we derive closed-form expressions for local false-alarm and miss-detection probabilities. By leveraging a probability-generating-function (PGF) and elementary-symmetric-polynomial (ESP) framework, combined with a breakpoint-based partition of the threshold domain, we obtain explicit closed-form characterizations of the system-level detection error probability (DEP) under non-i.i.d. majority-voting fusion. Building on this analytical framework, we formulate a robust optimization problem to maximize the average covert rate subject to covertness constraint. To solve the resulting nonconvex design, we develop an MM-BCD-SCA algorithm that produces tractable alternating updates for power/radiation variables and PA positions via convex surrogates and inner approximations of the DEP value function. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the impact of cooperative monitoring and PASS radiation laws on the covertness-rate tradeoff.",

    "abstract": "It has recently been observed that, in contrast to the classical case, holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line $\\mathbb{C}\\mathrm{P}_q^1$ are not uniquely determined by degree. In this work, we develop a fixed-point-theoretic framework for the analysis of flat $\\overline\\partial$-connections that define holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line. Within this framework, we establish sufficient conditions ensuring the gauge equivalence of holomorphic connections. Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion characterising when two such holomorphic connections are gauge equivalent. This criterion is formulated in terms of the existence of fixed points, lying in the open unit ball, of certain nonlinear maps acting on an appropriate Banach space.",

    "abstract": "Multi-conflict traffic is ubiquitous. Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance safety, reduce emissions, and increase throughput through precise coordination and automation. However, existing CAV strategies remain confined to specialized scenarios, such as highway on-ramp merging or single-lane roundabouts, and traditional traffic signals sacrifice efficiency for safety via rigid phasing and all-red intervals. In this paper, we present Cyclic Modulation Control of Multi-Conflict Connected Automated Traffic (CMAT), a unified, geometry-agnostic framework that embeds each conflict point into a repeating sequence of \"micro-phases\". Vehicles dynamically form platoons with demand-responsive sizes and negotiate time slots for occupying conflict points, enabling collision-free traversal and high intersection utilization. CMAT aims to minimize delay, guarantee safety, and accommodate arbitrary merging, diverging, and crossing patterns without manual retuning. We formalize CMAT as a mixed-integer linear programming model constructed on a directed graph abstracted from the physical intersection layout. The performance of CMAT is evaluated across a suite of multi-conflict tests, including simple two-way crossings, four-leg intersections, complex connected intersections. The results demonstrate substantial reductions in delay and significant throughput improvements compared with state-of-the-art CAV coordination methods and traditional signal timing strategies.",

In fact, some profinite groups arising from anabelian geometry are center-free. In the present paper, we investigate how such center-freeness behaves when passing to maximal $m$-step solvable quotients for any integer $m\\geq 2$. In particular, we show that the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the geometric \u00e9tale fundamental group of a hyperbolic curve over a field of characteristic $0$ is center-free. Furthermore, we show that this implies the injectivity statement, i.e., the rigidity property, of the $m$-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture.",

When combined with random orthogonal/unitary mixing to mitigate non-ideal, structured or correlated sensing settings, the proposed framework extends VAMP to complex black-box inference problems where explicit modeling is intractable.

The method follows a discretize-then-project strategy: the full-order operators are first assembled using finite volume or finite element discretizations and then projected onto low-dimensional spaces using a small set of spatial sampling points, selected through hyper-reduction techniques such as DEIM. This approach removes the dependence of the online computational cost on the full mesh size. The method is assessed on three benchmark problems: a linear transport equation, a nonlinear Burgers equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations. The results show that the hyper-reduced models closely match full-order solutions while achieving substantial reductions in computational time. Since only a sparse subset of mesh cells is evaluated during the online phase, the method is naturally parallelizable and scalable to very large meshes. These findings demonstrate that hyper-reduction can be effectively combined with segregated solvers and geometric parametrization to enable fast and accurate CFD simulations.",

In ${\\rm BC}_1$ case it is factorized to the product of two Lax matrices depending on 4 constants. Then we apply an IRF-Vertex type gauge transformation and obtain a product of the Lax matrices for the Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostats.

In particular case, when 4 pairs of constants coincide, the ${\\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model exactly coincides with the relativistic Zhukovsky-Volterra gyrostat. Explicit change of variables is obtained. We also consider another special case of the ${\\rm BC}_1$ Ruijsenaars-van Diejen model with 7 independent constants.

    "abstract": "Gr\u00f6bner basis computation over multivariate polynomial rings remains one of the most powerful yet computationally hostile primitives in symbolic computation. While modern algorithms (Faug\u00e8re-type F4 and signature-based F5) reduce many instances to large sparse linear algebra over finite fields, their dominant cost is not merely elimination but the symbolic preprocessing that constructs Macaulay-style matrices whose rows encode shifted reducers. This phase is characterized by dynamic combinatorics (monomial discovery, sparse row assembly, and deduplication) and is typically memory-latency bound, resisting naive parallelization.\n  This article develops a rigorous synthesis that reframes S-polynomial reduction as syzygy discovery: row construction is a structured map from module relations to the kernel of a massive, sparse, highly non-random Macaulay matrix A over Fp. Building on this viewpoint, we propose a GPU-targeted architecture that (i) converts dynamic symbolic data structures into static, two-pass allocations via prefix-sum planning; (ii) enforces coalesced memory access through structure-of-arrays polynomial layouts and sorted monomial dictionaries; and (iii) integrates finite-field arithmetic kernels (Montgomery/Barrett-style reduction) at register granularity. On the linear-algebra side, we explore the transition from classical Gaussian elimination to parallel structured Gaussian elimination (PSGE) and to Krylov-type kernel solvers (Block Wiedemann/Lanczos) that better match GPU throughput while controlling fill-in.\n  The result is a principled bridge between algebraic syzygy theory and SIMT hardware constraints, isolating the true bottleneck and providing a pathway to massively parallel reductions for multivariate polynomial systems.",

    "abstract": "Score-based diffusion models have become a powerful framework for generative modeling, with score estimation as a central statistical bottleneck. Existing guarantees for score estimation largely focus on light-tailed targets or rely on restrictive assumptions such as compact support, which are often violated by heavy-tailed data in practice. In this work, we study conventional (Gaussian) score-based diffusion models when the target distribution is heavy-tailed and belongs to a Sobolev class with smoothness parameter $\u03b2>0$. We consider both exponential and polynomial tail decay, indexed by a tail parameter $\u03b3$. Using kernel density estimation, we derive sharp minimax rates for score estimation, revealing a qualitative dichotomy: under exponential tails, the rate matches the light-tailed case up to polylogarithmic factors, whereas under polynomial tails the rate depends explicitly on $\u03b3$. We further provide sampling guarantees for the associated continuous reverse dynamics. In total variation, the generated distribution converges at the minimax optimal rate $n^{-\u03b2/(2\u03b2+d)}$ under exponential tails (up to logarithmic factors), and at a $\u03b3$-dependent rate under polynomial tails. Whether the latter sampling rate is minimax optimal remains an open question. These results characterize the statistical limits of score estimation and the resulting sampling accuracy for heavy-tailed targets, extending diffusion theory beyond the light-tailed setting.",

    "abstract": "Standard projection-based model reduction for dynamical systems incurs closure error because it only accounts for instantaneous dependence on the resolved state. From the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) perspective, projecting the full dynamics onto a low-dimensional resolved subspace induces additional noise and memory terms arising from the dynamics of the unresolved component in the orthogonal complement. The memory term makes the resolved dynamics explicitly history dependent. In this work, based on the MZ identity, we derive exact, history-enriched models for the resolved dynamics of linear driven dynamical systems and formulate inverse problems to learn model operators from discrete snapshot data via least-squares regression. We propose a greedy time-marching scheme to solve the inverse problems efficiently and analyze operator identifiability under full and partial observation data availability. For full observation data, we show that, under mild assumptions, the operators are identifiable even when the full-state dynamics are governed by a general time-varying linear operator, whereas with partial observation data the inverse problem has a unique solution only when the full-state operator is time-invariant. To address the resulting non-uniqueness in the time-varying case, we introduce a time-smoothing Tikhonov regularization. Numerical results demonstrate that the operators can be faithfully reconstructed from both full and partial observation data and that the learned history-enriched MZ models yield accurate trajectories of the resolved state.",

This yields an analytic Lagrangian relaxation: the single-patient Lagrangian value is a piecewise-affine convex function of the intervention price, enabling efficient computation of multi-patient dual bounds and certified relative optimality gaps. We also analyze how the Whittle index depends on the lapse and spontaneous-recovery parameters, providing qualitative insights on intervention priorities. In a large-scale numerical study over heterogeneous two-type populations, we compare Whittle's index policy with a myopic index rule and simple baselines; while myopic is highly competitive on most instances, Whittle's policy yields substantial gains in tight-capacity regimes with a fragile minority, reaching up to about $26\\%$ higher reward and markedly smaller relative optimality gaps.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the integration of vector coded caching (VCC) into multi-beam satellite communications (SATCOM) systems and demonstrates that even limited receiver-side caching can substantially enhance spectral efficiency. By leveraging cached content to suppress interference, VCC enables the concurrent transmission of multiple precoded signal vectors that would otherwise require separate transmission resources. This leads to a multiplicative improvement in resource utilization in SATCOM. To characterize this performance, we model the satellite-to-ground channel using Rician-shadowed fading and after incorporating practical considerations such as matched-filter precoding, channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead as well as CSI imperfections at the transmitter, we here derive closed-form expressions for the average sum rate and spectral efficiency gain of VCC in SATCOM. Our analysis, tightly validated through numerical simulations, reveals that VCC can yield spectral efficiency gains of 300% to 550% over traditional multi-user MISO SATCOM with the same resources. These gains -- which have nothing to do with multicasting, prefetching gains nor file popularity -- highlight VCC as a pure physical-layer solution for future high-throughput SATCOM systems, significantly narrowing the performance gap between satellite and wired networks.",

In addition to finding a weak solution, we also determine a source coefficient in the right-hand side of the differential equation. To make the problem well-posed, an integral-type overdetermination condition is imposed. After reducing the inverse problem to a direct one, we solve the latter in several steps. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the corresponding initial-boundary value problem on a finite time interval. Next, we show that this solution can be extended in a bounded way to the semiaxis $t\\ge 0$. In the following step, we further extend this bounded solution to all $t\\in R$. Finally, we establish that if the data of the original problem are almost periodic (or periodic), then the resulting bounded weak solution is itself almost periodic (or periodic).",

This paper addresses the recently studied Random Access Problem, which evaluates the expected number of read samples required to recover a specific information strand from $n$ encoded strands. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the exact expected number of reads, achieving a computational complexity of $O(n)$ for fixed field size $q$ and information length $k$. Furthermore, we derive explicit formulas for the average and maximum expected number of reads, enabling an efficient search for optimal generator matrices under small parameters. Beyond theoretical analysis, we present new code constructions that improve the best-known upper bound from $0.8815k$ to $0.8811k$ for $k=3$, and achieve an upper bound of $0.8629k$ for $k=4$ for sufficiently large $q$. We also establish a tighter theoretical lower bound on the expected number of reads that improves upon state-of-the-art bounds. In particular, this bound establishes the optimality of the simple parity code for the case of $n=k+1$ across any alphabet $q$.",

A randomized dyadic expansion is used to explore a one-dimensional orbit until a probabilistic \\emph{no-underrun} criterion is met, after which the next state is sampled from the explored orbit with probability proportional to the target weights. On the theory side, embedding this transition within the Gibbs self-tuning (GIST) framework provides a concise proof of reversibility. Moreover, we construct a \\emph{shift coupling} for orbit segments and prove an explicit edge-wise contraction in the Cayley distance under a mild Lipschitz condition on the energy $E(\u03c3)=d(\u03c3,\u03c3_0)$.

By constructing an appropriate Lyapunov function, the existence of an invariant measure is established. This extension thus enables the modelling of richer hysteretic behavior and broadens the scope of PDE alternatives to Monte Carlo methods.

Such problems naturally arise from distributed resource allocation and constrained machine learning. To achieve high communication efficiency for the distributed applications, we propose a nonlinear alternating direction method of multipliers (NL-ADMM) that preserves the classical splitting structure while accommodating general convex functional constraints. Unlike existing ADMM variants for nonconvex constrained problems, the proposed method does not require smoothness of the objective functions or differentiability of the constraint mapping, by leveraging convexity of the considered problem. We establish global convergence and an ergodic $O(1/k)$ convergence rate of NL-ADMM by assuming the existence of a KKT solution. The results extend those of ADMM for linearly constrained convex problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on two representative distributed tasks. The results on numerous instances demonstrate that NL-ADMM can achieve (in many cases) 100x higher communication efficiency than the classic augmented Lagrangian method and nearly 2x higher than the Douglas-Rachford operator splitting method, making the new method well suited for large-scale distributed learning systems.",

In this paper, we study a multi-server secure aggregation problem in a two-hop network consisting of multiple aggregation servers and multiple users per server, under the presence of user collusion. Each user communicates only with its associated server, while the servers exchange messages to jointly recover the global sum. We adopt an information-theoretic security framework, allowing up to $T$ users to collude with any server.\n  We characterize the complete optimal rate region in terms of user-to-server communication rate, server-to-server communication rate, individual key rate, and source key rate. Our main result shows that the minimum communication and individual key rates are all one symbol per input symbol, while the optimal source key rate is given by $\\min\\{U+V+T-2,\\, UV-1\\}$, where $U$ denotes the number of servers and $V$ the number of users per server. The achievability is established via a linear key construction that ensures correctness and security against colluding users, while the converse proof relies on tight entropy bounds derived from correctness and security constraints.\n  The results reveal a fundamental tradeoff between security and key efficiency and demonstrate that the multi-server architecture can significantly reduce the required key randomness compared to single-server secure aggregation.

    "abstract": "Let $D$ be a totally definite quaternion algebra over a totally real number field $F$, and $\\mathcal{O}$ be an $O_F$-order (of full rank) in $D$. The type number $t(\\mathcal{O})$ is an important arithmetic invariant of $\\mathcal{O}$ that counts the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same genus as $\\mathcal{O}$ (i.e. locally isomorphic to $\\mathcal{O}$ at every finite place $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $F$). The type number formula has been studied by Eichler, Peters, Pizer, Vigneras, K\u00f6rner and many others. As the genus of $\\mathcal{O}$ further divides into spinor genera, one naturally seeks a finer type number formula for the number of isomorphism classes of orders belonging to the same spinor genus of $\\mathcal{O}$. The main goal of this paper is to provide such a refinement for a large class of quaternion $O_F$-orders $\\mathcal{O}$ that includes all Eichler orders. This enables us to prove that $t(\\mathcal{O})$ is divisible by the order of a quotient group $\\mathrm{WSG}(\\mathcal{O})$ of the Gauss genus group $\\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)/\\mathrm{Cl}^+(O_F)^2$ naturally attached to $\\mathcal{O}$. Similarly, we show that the trace of the $\\mathfrak{n}$-Brandt matrix $\\mathfrak{B}(\\mathcal{O}, \\mathfrak{n})$ is divisible by the class number $h(F)$ for any nonzero integral $O_F$-ideal $\\mathfrak{n}$. In particular, the class number $h(\\mathcal{O})=\\mathrm{Tr}(\\mathfrak{B}(\\mathcal{O}, O_F))$ is always divisible by $h(F)$ for such quaternion orders. This generalizes the divisibility result of $h(\\mathcal{O})$ proved in a different way by Chia-Fu Yu and the second named author [Indiana Univ. Math. J., Vol. 70, No. 2 (2021)] in the case when $\\mathcal{O}$ is a maximal $O_F$-order in a totally definite quaternion algebra unramified at all the finite places.",

    "abstract": "The FKG inequality is an invaluable tool in monotone spin systems satisfying the FKG lattice condition, which provides positive correlations for all coordinate-wise increasing functions of spins. However, the FKG lattice condition is somewhat brittle and is not preserved when confining a spin system to a particular phase. For instance, consider the Curie-Weiss model, which is a model of a ferromagnet with two phases at low temperature corresponding to positive and negative overall magnetization. It is not a priori clear if each phase internally has positive correlations for increasing functions, or if the positive correlations in the model arise primarily from the global choice of positive or negative magnetization.\n  In this article, we show that the individual phases do indeed satisfy an approximate form of the FKG inequality in a class of generalized higher-order Curie-Weiss models (including the standard Curie-Weiss model as a special case), as well as in ferromagnetic exponential random graph models (ERGMs). To cover both of these settings, we present a general result which allows for the derivation of such approximate FKG inequalities in a straightforward manner from inputs related to metastable mixing; we expect that this general result will be widely applicable. In addition, we derive some consequences of the approximate FKG inequality, including a version of a useful covariance inequality originally due to Newman as well as Bulinski and Shabanovich. We use this to extend the proof of the central limit theorem for ERGMs within a phase at low temperatures, due to the second author, to the non-forest phase-coexistence regime, answering a question posed by Bianchi, Collet, and Magnanini for the edge-triangle model.",

(2017) as the analogue of the classical PLR group. While the PLR group connects triadic cadential sets via the relative morphism $R$, the tetradic case reveals a richer structure: two pairs of cadential sets connected by distinct morphisms forming a \"prism\" in the slice category over the tonic seventh chord, and a single pair for those that allow quantized modulations. We demonstrate this structure through analysis of Charlie Parker's \"Blues for Alice\" (1951) and Ray Noble's \"Cherokee\" (1938), showing how the prism morphism, PLRQ transformations and quantized modulations organize harmonic navigation in bebop. The categorical framework captures what syntactic approaches miss: the transformational v\u00e9cu that musicians actually experience when navigating between cadential regions.",

The exposition follows a compute first then abstract philosophy, in which analytic and geometric structures are introduced through explicit calculations and local models before being organized into conceptual frameworks.\n  The notes begin with the foundations of complex analysis, including holomorphic functions, Cauchy theory, power series, residues, and contour integration, with an emphasis on hands on techniques such as Laurent expansions, residue calculus, and branch cut methods. These analytic tools are then used to construct Riemann surfaces explicitly via branched coverings and gluing constructions, which serve as recurring test cases throughout the text.\n  Differential forms, Stokes theorem, curvature, and the Gauss Bonnet theorem provide the geometric bridge to Hodge theory, culminating in a detailed and self contained treatment of the Hodge Weyl theorem on compact Riemann surfaces, including weak formulations, regularity, and concrete examples. The algebraic geometric core develops holomorphic line bundles, divisors, the Picard group, and sheaves, followed by Cech and sheaf cohomology, the exponential sequence, and de Rham and Dolbeault theories, all treated with explicit computations.\n  The Riemann Roch theorem is presented with full proofs and applications, leading to the construction of the Jacobian, Abel Jacobi theory, theta functions, and the correspondence between Riemann surfaces, algebraic curves, and Galois coverings. Originating from collaborative study groups associated with the Enjoying Math community, these notes are intended for graduate students seeking a concrete and unified route from complex analysis to algebraic geometry.",

    "abstract": "We propose and analyze a second-order, dimension-split exponential time differencing Runge--Kutta scheme (ETD2RK-DS) for multidimensional reaction--diffusion equations in two and three spatial dimensions. Under mild assumptions on the nonlinear source term, we establish uniform stability bounds and prove second-order temporal convergence for the underlying dimension-split scheme.\n  To enable efficient implementation, we employ Pad\u00e9 approximations of the matrix exponential, converting each required matrix-exponential--vector product into the solution of a shifted linear system. A convergence analysis of the resulting Pad\u00e9-based ETD2RK-DS formulation is provided. We derive explicit and reproducible tensor-slicing and reshaping algorithms that realize the dimension-splitting strategy, decomposing multidimensional systems into collections of independent one-dimensional problems. This leads to a reduction of the dominant per-time-step computational cost from $\\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ in two dimensions and from $\\mathcal{O}(m^5)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m^3)$ in three dimensions when compared with banded LU solvers for the unsplit problem, where $m$ denotes the number of grid points per spatial direction.\n  Furthermore, we develop a Sylvester-equation reformulation of the resulting one-dimensional systems, enabling a highly efficient spectral implementation based on reusable eigendecompositions, matrix--vector multiplications, and Hadamard divisions. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions, including a coupled FitzHugh--Nagumo system, confirm the second-order temporal accuracy, stability of the underlying scheme, and scalability of the proposed ETD2RK-DS framework, as well as the substantial computational advantages of the Sylvester-based implementation over classical LU-based solvers.",

    "abstract": "Determining the maximum demand a water distribution network can satisfy is crucial for ensuring reliable supply and planning network expansion. This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times.",

Motivated by applications to associative learning, particularly to discrimination training, extra conditions are imposed on $F(t)$ and $A(t)$, one of them relating $A(t)$ to a symmetric non-negative definite matrix $K$ relevant to mathematical models of associative learning. Structural relationships between the matrices imply an identity satisfied by the Floquet multipliers driving the dynamics of $w(mT)$ from which follows that the unstable subspace is $\\ker K$. Then, the limit of $w(mT)$ is explicitly identified when $K$ is invertible, while the limit of $Kw(mT)$ is established otherwise.

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks based on automatic differentiation (AD-PINNs) and their finite-difference counterparts (FD-PINNs) are widely used for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), yet their analytical properties remain poorly understood. This work provides a unified mathematical foundation for both formulations. Under mild regularity assumptions on the activation function and for sufficiently wide neural networks of depth at least two, we prove that both the AD- and FD-PINN optimization problems are ill-posed: whenever a minimizer exists, there are in fact infinitely many, and uniqueness fails regardless of the choice of collocation points or finite-difference stencil. Nevertheless, we establish two structural properties. First, whenever the underlying PDE or its finite-difference discretization admits a solution, the corresponding AD-PINN or FD-PINN loss also admits a minimizer, realizable by a neural network of finite width. Second, FD-PINNs are tightly coupled to the underlying finite-difference scheme: every FD-PINN minimizer agrees with a finite-difference minimizer on the grid, and in regimes where the discrete PDE solution is unique, all zero-loss FD-PINN minimizers coincide with the discrete PDE solution on the stencil. Numerical experiments illustrate these theoretical insights: FD-PINNs remain stable in representative forward and inverse problems, including settings where AD-PINNs may fail to converge. We also include an inverse problem with noisy data, demonstrating that FD-PINNs retain robustness in this setting as well. Taken together, our results clarify the analytical limitations of AD-PINNs and explain the structural reasons for the more stable behavior observed in FD-PINNs.",

    "title": "Engineering Favorable Propagation: Near-Field IRS Deployment for Spatial Multiplexing",
    "abstract": "In intelligent reflecting surface IRS assisted multiple input multiple output MIMO systems, a strong line of sight LoS link is required to compensate for the severe cascaded path loss. However, such a link renders the effective channel highly rank deficient and fundamentally limits spatial multiplexing. To overcome this limitation, this paper leverages the large aperture of sparse arrays to harness near field spherical wavefronts, and establishes a deterministic deployment criterion that strategically positions the IRS in the near field of a base station BS. This placement exploits the spherical wavefronts of the BS IRS link to engineer decorrelated channels, thereby fundamentally overcoming the rank deficiency issue in far field cascaded channels. Based on a physical channel model for the sparse BS array and the IRS, we characterize the rank properties and inter user correlation of the cascaded BS IRS user channel. We further derive a closed form favorable propagation metric that reveals how the sparse array geometry and the IRS position can be tuned to reduce inter user channel correlation. The resulting geometry driven deployment rule provides a simple guideline for creating a favorable propagation environment with enhanced effective degrees of freedom. The favorable channel statistics induced by our deployment criterion enable a low complexity maximum ratio transmission MRT precoding scheme. This serves as the foundation for an efficient algorithm that jointly optimizes the IRS phase shifts and power allocation based solely on long term statistical channel state information CSI. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our deployment criterion and demonstrate that our optimization framework achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes.",

    "abstract": "Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition (PMD)\\cite{doi:10.1137/25M1738863}, developed in our earlier work, provides a nonlinear model reduction by embedding high-dimensional dynamics onto low-dimensional probabilistic manifolds. The PMD has demonstrated strong performance for time-dependent systems. However, its formulation is for temporal dynamics and does not directly accommodate parametric variability, which limits its applicability to tasks such as design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification. In order to address the limitations, a \\emph{Parametric Probabilistic Manifold Decomposition} (PPMD) is presented to deal with parametric problems. The central advantage of PPMD is its ability to construct continuous, high-fidelity parametric surrogates while retaining the transparency and non-intrusive workflow of PMD. By integrating probabilistic-manifold embeddings with parameter-aware latent learning, PPMD enables smooth predictions across unseen parameter values (such as different boundary or initial conditions). To validate the proposed method, a comprehensive convergence analysis is established for PPMD, covering the approximation of the linear principal subspace, the geometric recovery of the nonlinear solution manifold, and the statistical consistency of the kernel ridge regression used for latent learning. The framework is then numerically demonstrated on two classic flow configurations: flow past a cylinder and backward-facing step flow. Results confirm that PPMD achieves superior accuracy and generalization beyond the training parameter range compared to the conventional proper orthogonal decomposition with Gaussian process regression (POD+GPR) method.",

Our approach is based on a mixed formulation involving a displacement field and a Lagrange multiplier, enforcing the contact conditions, representing tractions at fractures. The approximation space for the displacement is made of vectors values attached to each vertex, edge, face, and element, while the Lagrange multiplier space is approximated by piecewise constant vectors on each fracture face. The displacement degrees of freedom allow reconstruct piecewise quadratic approximations of this field. We prove a discrete Korn inequality that account for the fractures, as well as an inf-sup condition (in a non-standard $H^{-1/2}$-norm) between the discrete Lagrange multiplier space and the discrete displacement space. We provide an in-depth error analysis of the scheme and show that, contrary to usual low-order nodal-based schemes, our method is robust in the quasi-incompressible limit for the primal variable~(displacement). An extensive set of numerical experiments confirms the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the practical accuracy and robustness of the scheme.",

They are collections Q of smooth cooriented surfaces, intersecting transversally everywhere but in a finite set of quadruple crossing points. We require that shifting any surface of the collection from such a point in the direction of its coorientation creates a simplex with the cooriented out faces. The Q-diagrams are 3d analogs of bipartite ribbon graphs.\n  Let L be the Lagrangian in the cotangent bundle to M given by the union of the zero section and the conormal bundles to the cooriented surfaces of Q.

It is a singular Lagrangian in a symplectic space, providing a symplectic stack X(dL), and a restriction functor from X(L) to X(dL). The image of the latter is Lagrangian.

The methodology addresses uncertainty through sub-Gaussian concentration bounds for route-level risk buffers and explicitly accounts for competing operational KPIs through a multi-objective formulation. Empirical analysis of prediction residuals validates the sub-Gaussian assumption underlying the risk model. From an empirical point of view, our results report improvements around 20-25\\% in operator utilization and completion rates compared with plans computed using default durations.

While the latter methods have symmetric and positive definite iteration operators that facilitate their analysis, the operator in Kaczmarz's method is nonsymmetric and it has been an open question so far to understand this fast initial convergence. We perform a spectral analysis of Kaczmarz's method that gives new insight into its (often fast) initial behavior.

TriCG takes advantage of the inherent block structure of SQD linear systems and performs substantially better than SYMMLQ. However, numerical experiments have revealed that the convergence of TriCG can be notably slow when the off-diagonal block contains a substantial number of large elliptic singular values. To address this limitation, we introduce a deflation strategy tailored for TriCG to improve its convergence behavior. Specifically, we develop a generalized Saunders--Simon--Yip process with deflated restarting to construct the deflation subspaces. Building upon this process, we propose a novel method termed TriCG with deflated restarting. The deflation subspaces can also be utilized to solve SQD linear systems with multiple right-hand sides.

The system in question is a combination of GPT-5.2 Pro by OpenAI and Aristotle by Harmonic, operated by Kevin Barreto. The final result of the system is a formal proof written in Lean, which we translate to informal mathematics in the present writeup for wider accessibility.\n  The proved result is as follows. We show a logarithmic-gap phenomenon regarding factorial divisibility: For any constants $0<C_1<C_2$ there exist infinitely many triples $(a,b,n)\\in\\mathbb N^3$ such that \\[ a!\\,b!\\mid n!\\,(a+b-n)!\\qquad\\text{and}\\qquad C_1\\log n < a+b-n < C_2\\log n. \\] The argument reduces this to a binomial divisibility $\\binom{m+k}{k}\\mid\\binom{2m}{m}$ and studies it prime-by-prime.

Although PDHG-based solvers have shown strong performance on single-node GPU architectures, their applicability to industrial-scale instances is often limited by GPU memory capacity and computational throughput. To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead. Extensive experiments on standard LP benchmarks, including MIPLIB and Hans' instances, as well as large-scale real-world datasets, show that our distributed implementation, built upon cuPDLPx, achieves strong scalability and high performance while preserving full FP64 numerical accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.",

We first derive the limiting bounds as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) goes to infinity and the system interference goes to zero. Then, we construct an infinite-state Markov chain to describe the consecutive packet losses of the control systems to derive the MAP bounds. Finally, the MAP bounds are approximated as the bounds of the transition probability from the state with no packet loss to the state with consecutive single packet loss. The simulation results show that the MAP performance of $\\left(64,16\\right)$ polar code and 16-bit CRC coincides with the limiting upper bound as the SNR increases and has $3.0$dB performance gain compared with the normal approximation of the finite block rate at block error rate $10^{-3}$.",

To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle.

    "abstract": "$X$-secure and $T$-private information retrieval (XSTPIR) is a variant of private information retrieval where data security is guaranteed against collusion among up to $X$ servers and the user's retrieval privacy is guaranteed against collusion among up to $T$ servers. Recently, researchers have constructed XSTPIR schemes through the theory of algebraic geometry codes and algebraic curves, with the aim of obtaining XSTPIR schemes that have higher maximum PIR rates for fixed field size and $X,T$ (the number of servers $N$ is not restricted). The mainstream approach is to employ curves of higher genus that have more rational points, evolving from rational curves to elliptic curves to hyperelliptic curves and, most recently, to Hermitian curves.\n  In this paper, we propose a different perspective: with the shared goal of constructing XSTPIR schemes with higher maximum PIR rates, we move beyond the mainstream approach of seeking curves with higher genus and more rational points. Instead, we aim to achieve this goal by enhancing the utilization efficiency of rational points on curves that have already been considered in previous work. By introducing a family of bases for the polynomial space $\\text{span}_{\\mathbb{F}_q}\\{1,x,\\dots,x^{k-1}\\}$ as an alternative to the Lagrange interpolation basis, we develop two new families of XSTPIR schemes based on rational curves and Hermitian curves, respectively. Parameter comparisons demonstrate that our schemes achieve superior performance. Specifically, our Hermitian-curve-based XSTPIR scheme provides the largest known maximum PIR rates when the field size $q^2\\geq 14^2$ and $X+T\\geq 4q$. Moreover, for any field size $q^2\\geq 28^2$ and $X+T\\geq 4$, our two XSTPIR schemes collectively provide the largest known maximum PIR rates.",

Second, to further reduce computational complexity, we establish the theory of equivalence classes for pre-transformed polar codes. Codes within the same equivalence class share an identical weight distribution but correspond to different \\emph{Expanded Information Set} sizes. By selecting the pre-transformation matrix that minimizes the \\emph{Expanded Information Set} size within an equivalence class, we optimize the computation process.

We focus on floating-point arithmetic, which allows for using efficient matrix multiplication libraries. However, the existing approach is limited to primes p with bitsize at most half the mantissa size (e.g., 26 bits with double precision arithmetic), and becomes quite inefficient when p approaches this limit. We present a new approach that overcomes this limitation and can efficiently handle primes with larger bitsizes. The key idea is to use multiword decompositions, which represent A and B as scaled sums of u and v matrices (words) with smaller coefficients. We provide a rigorous analysis that proves the correctness of this approach for suitably chosen scaling parameters. Our analysis determines the maximum bitsize of p that can be handled for a given number of words; in particular, we show that decomposing in two words each input suffices to handle bitsizes almost equal to the full mantissa size (e.g., the 26 bits limit is raised to 52 bits in double precision arithmetic). Moreover, we show that (1,v) decompositions with v>1 are also of interest to handle intermediate bitsizes. We perform an extensive experimental analysis for various matrix shapes and prime bitsizes. Our performance benchmarks on both CPU and GPU architectures confirm the efficiency of the proposed approach, which can outperform the existing single word approach for bitsizes as low as 23, and can handle bitsizes as high as 52 while retaining high performance.",

    "abstract": "Discrete gradient methods are a class of numerical integrators producing solutions with exact preservation of first integrals of ordinary differential equations. In this paper, we apply order theory combined with the symmetrized Itoh--Abe discrete gradient and finite differences to construct an integral-preserving fourth-order method that is derivative-free. The numerical scheme is implicit and a convergence result for Newton's iterations is provided, taking into account how the error due to the finite difference approximations affects the convergence rate. Numerical experiments verify the order and show that the derivative-free method is significantly faster than obtaining derivatives by automatic differentiation. Finally, an experiment using topographic data as the potential function of a Hamiltonian oscillator demonstrates how this method allows the simulation of discrete-time dynamics from a Hamiltonian that is a combination of data and analytical expressions.",

    "abstract": "We study the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (CM-DNLS), a mass-critical and completely integrable dispersive model. Recent works established finite-time blow-up constructions and soliton resolution, describing the asymptotic behaviors of blow-up solutions.\n  In this paper, we go beyond soliton resolution and provide a sharp classification of finite-time blow-up dynamics in the \\textit{single-bubble} regime. Assuming that a solution blows up at time $0<T<\\infty$ with a single-soliton profile, we determine all possible blow-up rates. For initial data in $H^{2L+1}(\\mathbb{R})$ with $L\\ge1$, we prove a dichotomy: either the solution lies in a \\emph{quantized regime}, where the scaling parameter satisfies \\[\n  \u03bb(t)\\sim (T-t)^{2k},\\qquad 1\\le k\\le L, \\] with convergent phase and translation parameters, or it lies in an \\emph{exotic regime}, where the blow-up rate satisfies $\u03bb(t)\\lesssim (T-t)^{2L+\\frac 32}$. To our knowledge, this is the first classification result for quantized blow-up dynamics in the class of dispersive models. We provide a framework for identifying the quantized blow-up rates in classification problems.\n  The proof relies on a modulation analysis combined with the hierarchy of conservation laws provided by the complete integrability of (CM-DNLS). However, it does not use \\emph{more refined integrability-based techniques}, such as the inverse scattering method, the method of commuting flows, or the explicit formula. As a result, our analysis applies beyond the chiral solutions.",

The human population is divided into compartments for primary and secondary infections, while the mosquito population includes single- and co-infected classes. ADE is modeled through distinct primary ($\u03b1$) and secondary ($\u03c3$) transmission rates. Using the next-generation matrix method, we derive the basic reproduction number $R_0$ and establish the local stability of the disease-free equilibrium for $R_0 < 1$. Analytical results show that one-strain endemic equilibria lose stability under ADE conditions ($\u03c3> \u03b1$), allowing invasion by a heterologous strain. Employing center-manifold theory and numerical continuation (COCO), we demonstrate the occurrence of backward bifurcation, bistability between disease-free and endemic states, and Hopf-induced oscillations. Numerical simulations confirm transitions among disease-free, endemic, and periodic regimes as key parameters vary. The model highlights how ADE, waning cross-immunity, and vector co-infection interact to generate complex dengue dynamics and provides insights useful for designing effective control and vaccination strategies in dengue-endemic regions.",

    "abstract": "Traditional reinforcement learning usually assumes either episodic interactions with resets or continuous operation to minimize average or cumulative loss. While episodic settings have many theoretical results, resets are often unrealistic in practice. The infinite-horizon setting avoids this issue but lacks non-asymptotic guarantees in online scenarios with unknown dynamics. In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes. To evaluate algorithms in this framework, we introduce the periodic regret, a measure that balances cumulative loss with the terminal law constraint. We then propose the first algorithms for computing periodic policies in two multi-agent settings and show they achieve sublinear periodic regret of order $\\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. This provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees for reset-free learning in the setting of $M$ homogeneous agents, for $M > 1$.",

Our approach is based on a goal--oriented dual-weighted residual technique for the optimal control of neural differential equations. This leads to an ordinary differential equation constrained optimization problem with controls acting as coefficients and a specific loss function. We implement our approach on the basis of a DG(0) Galerkin discretization of the neural ODE, leading to an explicit Euler time marching scheme. For the optimization we use steepest descent. Finally, we apply our method to the construction of neural networks for the classification of data sets, where we present results for a selection of well known examples from the literature.",

    "title": "Novel Decoding Algorithm for Noiseless Non-Adaptive Group Testing",
    "abstract": "Group testing enables the identification of a small subset of defective items within a larger population by performing tests on pools of items rather than on each item individually. Over the years, it has not only attracted attention from the academic community, but has also demonstrated its potential in addressing real-world problems such as infectious disease screening, drug discovery and manufacturing quality control. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, interest in group testing has grown further, particularly in non-adaptive testing, due to its time efficiency compared to adaptive approaches. This highlights the importance of improving the performance currently achievable in such a scheme. This article focuses on advancing the field of noiseless non-adaptive group testing. The main objective of this work is to study and maximize the probability of successfully identifying the subset of defective items while performing as few tests as possible. To this end, we first note current well-known decoding algorithms, as well as established test design strategies for assigning items to pools. From this review, we identify key opportunities for improvement that inform the development of new decoding algorithms. Specifically, we propose a novel method, Weighted Sequential Combinatorial Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (W-SCOMP), to enhance the efficiency of existing detection procedures. Theoretical results demonstrate that W-SCOMP outperforms other algorithms in noiseless non-adaptive group testing. Furthermore, we develop a simulation framework to model the group testing process and conduct comparative evaluations between the proposed and existing algorithms. The empirical results are consistent with the theoretical findings. Overall, our work expands the range of available decoding algorithms and contributes to the broader understanding of noiseless non-adaptive group testing.",

Moving beyond the classical problem of identifying graphs determined by their generalized spectrum, we address the more quantitative question of how many non-isomorphic graphs can share the same generalized spectrum. Our approach is based on arithmetic constraints derived from the Smith Normal Form (SNF) of the walk matrix $W(G)$, which lead to a tight upper bound on the number of generalized cospectral mates of a graph. Our upper bound applies to a much broader class of graphs than those previously shown to have no generalized cospectral mates (determined by generalized spectrum). Consequently, this work extends the family of graphs for which strong and informative spectral uniqueness",

    "abstract": "We consider the geometry of a class of fractal sets in $\\mathbb{R}^{2}$ that generalise the famous Koch curve and Koch snowflake. While the classical Koch curve is defined by an iterative process that divides a line segment into three parts and replaces the middle part by the legs of an isosceles triangle 'above' the line segment, in this more general setting, a choice can be made at each iteration as to whether to place this triangle 'above' or 'below' the line segment. The resulting fractals bear a striking visual resemblance to curves appearing in nature, such as coastlines and snowflakes. While these fractals can be generated by a random process that flips a coin each time to decide the orientation of the triangle, leading to 'almost sure' results for their geometrical properties, we define and study them deterministically to provide exact results. In particular, we show, using the theory of non-integer expansions, that the set of all possible values for the area enclosed by these generalised Koch curves is a closed interval. Moreover, we prove that the union of all these generalised snowflakes does not contain an open set, and has zero $2$-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Complementing these results, using arguments from calculus and fractal geometry, namely properties of geometric series and Frostman's Lemma, we show that each generalised Koch curve has infinite length and the same Hausdorff dimension as its classical counterpart. Further, we also give a classification for when a generalised Koch curve is a quasicircle.",

This contradiction underlies Condorcet's Paradox, a pioneering result of Social Choice Theory, wherein intuitive and seemingly desirable constraints on decision-making necessarily lead to contradictory preference cycles. Topological methods have since broadened Social Choice Theory and elucidated existing results. However, characterisations of preference cycles in Topological Social Choice Theory are lacking. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a framework for topologically modelling preference cycles that generalises Baryshnikov's existing topological model of strict, ordinal preferences on 3 alternatives. In our framework, the contradiction underlying Condorcet's Paradox topologically corresponds to the non-orientability of a surface homeomorphic to either the Klein Bottle or Real Projective Plane, depending on how preference cycles are represented. These findings allow us to reduce Arrow's Impossibility Theorem to a statement about the orientability of a surface. Furthermore, these results contribute to existing wide-ranging interest in the relationship between non-orientability, impossibility phenomena in Economics, and logical paradoxes more broadly.",

A single bias parameter~$\u03b2$ maps these weights into site-dependent log-likelihood ratios (LLRs), yielding anisotropic priors that plug directly into standard BP$\\rightarrow$OSD decoders without changing the code construction. We derive bounds relating directional and Hamming distances, upper bound the number of degenerate error classes per syndrome as a function of distance, rate, and directional bias, and give a MacWilliams-type expression for the directional enumerator. Finite-length simulations under code-capacity noise show significant logical error-rate reductions -- often an order of magnitude at moderate physical error rates -- confirming that modest anisotropy is a simple and effective route to hardware-aware decoding gains.",

We review the evolution of techniques from early lexicon-based and classical machine learning approaches to modern deep learning architectures and large language models, covering widely used datasets such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and SST-2, and models ranging from Naive Bayes and support vector machines to LSTM networks, BERT, and attention-based transformers. Beyond summarizing prior work, this survey differentiates itself by offering a comparative, challenge-driven analysis of how these modeling paradigms address domain-specific issues such as sarcasm, negation, contextual ambiguity, and domain shift, which remain open problems in existing literature. Unlike earlier reviews that focus primarily on text-only pipelines, we also synthesize recent advances in multimodal sentiment analysis that integrate textual, audio, and visual cues from movie trailers and clips. In addition, we examine emerging concerns related to interpretability, fairness, and robustness that are often underexplored in prior surveys, and we outline future research directions including zero-shot and few-shot learning, hybrid symbolic--neural models, and real-time deployment considerations. Overall, this abstract provides a domain-focused roadmap that highlights both established solutions and unresolved challenges toward building more accurate, generalizable, and explainable sentiment analysis systems for movie review data.",

    "abstract": "The Levenshtein sequence reconstruction problem studies the reconstruction of a transmitted sequence from multiple erroneous copies of it. A fundamental question in this field is to determine the minimum number of erroneous copies required to guarantee correct reconstruction of the original sequence. This problem is equivalent to determining the maximum possible intersection size of two error balls associated with the underlying channel. Existing research on the sequence reconstruction problem has largely focused on channels with a single type of error, such as insertions, deletions, or substitutions alone. However, relatively little is known for channels that involve a mixture of error types, for instance, channels allowing both deletions and substitutions. In this work, we study the sequence reconstruction problem for the single-deletion two-substitution channel, which allows one deletion and at most two substitutions applied to the transmitted sequence. Specifically, we prove that if two $q$-ary length-$n$ sequences have the Hamming distance $d\\geq 2$, where $q\\geq 2$ is any fixed integer, then the intersection size of their error balls under the single-deletion two-substitution channel is upper bounded by $(q^2-1)n^2-(3q^2+5q-5)n+O_q(1)$, where $O_q(1)$ is a constant independent from $n$ but dependent on $q$.

We introduce \\emph{sparse point-wise privacy leakage}, a worst-case privacy criterion that enforces two simultaneous constraints for every disclosed symbol $u\\in\\mathcal{U}$: (i) $u$ may be correlated with at most $N$ realizations of $X$, and (ii) the total leakage toward those realizations is bounded. In the high-privacy regime, we use concepts from information geometry to obtain a local quadratic approximation of mutual information which measures utility between $U$ and $Y$. When the leakage matrix $P_{X|Y}$ is invertible, this approximation reduces the design problem to a sparse quadratic maximization, known as the Rayleigh-quotient problem, with an $\\ell_0$ constraint. We further show that, for the approximated problem, one can without loss of optimality restrict attention to a binary released variable $U$ with a uniform distribution. For small alphabet sizes, the exact sparsity-constrained optimum can be computed via combinatorial support enumeration, which quickly becomes intractable as the dimension grows. For general dimensions, the resulting sparse Rayleigh-quotient maximization is NP-hard and closely related to sparse principal component analysis (PCA). We propose a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation that is solvable in polynomial time and provides a tractable surrogate for the NP-hard design, together with a simple rounding procedure to recover a feasible leakage direction. We also identify a sparsity threshold beyond which the sparse optimum saturates at the unconstrained spectral value and the SDP relaxation becomes tight.",

    "abstract": "FR3 ($\\approx$7-24 GHz), also referred to as the upper mid-band, has recently emerged as promising spectrum for 6G; however, its propagation and MIMO characteristics vary significantly with frequency and environment, and spectrum availability may be intermittent due to incumbents. Using site-specific ray tracing (Sionna RT) in representative indoor and outdoor scenarios, we evaluate 7, 10, 14, 20, and 24 GHz under SISO and MIMO configurations. The results show that FR3 exhibits propagation characteristics intermediate between sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands while supporting meaningful spatial multiplexing, albeit with strong site dependence. Motivated by these findings, we propose a fully digital frequency-adaptive multi-band MIMO architecture that repurposes ADCs/DACs and baseband processing resources across FR3 subbands via switching, enabling dynamic trade-offs between bandwidth (spectrum gain) and antenna consolidation (MIMO gain) under availability and channel constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting additional spectrum is often optimal, while adaptive resource repurposing becomes beneficial when subbands are unavailable or when multiplexing gains are concentrated at specific frequencies.",

By doing so, a doubled degree of freedom (DoF) is achieved compared to conventional PASS. Based on the new designed basic signal model of C-PASS, three practical operating protocols for C-PASS are proposed, namely power splitting (PS), direction switching (DS), and time switching (TS). Then, the sum-rate maximization problem for the joint optimization of transmit and pinching beamforming is formulated for each of the proposed protocols. 1) For PS, the highly coupled non-convex problem is first transformed into a tractable form via the weighted minimum mean square error reformulation and solved using the alternating optimization framework; 2) For DS, the above approach is subsequently extended to solve the mixed-integer constraints inherent for DS via the penalty-based algorithm; 3) For TS, the optimization problem can be decomposed into two subproblems and solved using the similar iterative techniques, while its optimal time allocation ratio is derived in closed form. Finally, numerical results reveal that TS is superior in the low-power regime, while PS and DS achieve significantly higher rates in the high-power regime due to the enhanced DoF.",

For each edge, a specified subset of source symbols must be recoverable from its two incident nodes, while no information about the remaining sources is revealed. To meet the security requirement, a shared source key may be employed. The ratio between the source symbol size and the source key size defines the source key rate, and the supremum of all achievable rates is referred to as the source key capacity.\n  We study extremal values of the source key capacity in secure storage systems and provide complete graph characterizations for several fundamental settings. For the case where each edge is associated with a single source symbol, we characterize all graphs whose source key capacity equals one. We then generalize this result to the case where each edge is associated with multiple source symbols and identify a broad class of graphs that achieve the corresponding extremal capacity under a mild structural condition. In addition, we characterize all graphs for which secure storage can be achieved without using any source key.",

The obstruction to making this interplay genuinely functorial is that there are two independent compositions (restriction along inclusions and fusion/transport along bimodules) and they must be compatible on commuting spacetime diagrams, which is exactly the situation a double category is designed to encode. Part I resolves this by building a spacetime double category and a von Neumann algebra double category inspired by previous work by Orendain, and by packaging an AQFT input as a pseudo double functor whose vertical part is the Haag-Kastler net and whose squares record the required compatibilities in a well-typed way forced by commutativity.

We characterize the near- and off-critical phases of this model for any expanders family $\\mathcal{G}_n = (V_n, E_n)$ with uniformly bounded degrees. In particular, we show that the volume of the largest open cluster at level $h_n$ is of the order $|V_n|^{\\frac23}$ when $h_n$ lies in the corresponding critical window which we identify as $|h_n| = O(|V_n|^{-\\frac13})$. Outside this window, the volume starts to deviate from $\u0398(|V_n|^{\\frac23})$ culminating into a linear order in the supercritical phase $h_n = h < 0$ (the giant component) and a logarithmic order in the subcritical phase $h_n = h > 0$. We deduce these from effective estimates on tail probabilities for the maximum volume of an open cluster at any level $h$ for a generic base graph $\\mathcal{G}$. The estimates depend on $\\mathcal{G}$ only through its size and upper and lower bounds on its degrees and spectral gap respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance where a mean-field critical behavior is derived under such general setup for finite graphs. The generality of these estimates preclude any local approximation of $\\mathcal{G}$ by regular infinite trees -- a standard approach in the area. Instead, our methods rely on exploiting the connection between spectral gap of the graph $\\mathcal{G}$ and its connection to the level-sets of zero-average Gaussian free field mediated via a set function we call the zero-average capacity.",

    "abstract": "We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an LU factorization $A=LU$ for an arbitrary square matrix $A$, including singular and rank-deficient cases, without the use of row or column permutations. We prove that such a factorization exists if and only if the nullity of every leading principal submatrix is bounded by the sum of the nullities of the corresponding leading column and row blocks. While building upon the work of Okunev and Johnson, we present simpler, constructive proofs. Furthermore, we extend these results to characterize rank-revealing factorizations, providing explicit sparsity bounds for the factors $L$ and $U$. Finally, we derive analogous necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of factorizations constrained to have unit lower or unit upper triangular factors.",

In this work, we present the stability and convergence analysis for the $hp$-version of this method applied to elliptic problems on polytopal meshes. Moreover, we introduce fast and practical algorithms that allow the CDG, LDG, and BR2 methods to be implemented within a unified framework. Our numerical experiments show that the CDG method yields a compact stencil for the stiffness matrix, with faster assembly and solving times compared to the LDG and BR2 methods. We numerically study how coercivity depends on the method parameters for various mesh types, with particular focus on the number of facets per mesh element. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of choosing the correct directions for the numerical fluxes when using variable polynomial degrees.",

Nevertheless, these objects reveal a degree of unexpectedness relative to the classical framework, as we build examples of local iterated function systems which are not modeled by subshifts of finite type and give rise to non self-similar attractors.

    "abstract": "Many modern procedures use the data to learn a structure and then leverage it to test many hypotheses. If the entire data is used at both stages, analytical or computational corrections for selection bias are required to ensure validity (post-learning adjustment). Alternatively, one can learn and/or test on masked versions of the data to avoid selection bias, either via information splitting or null augmentation}. Choosing among these three learn-then-test paradigms, and how much masking to employ for the latter two, are critical decisions impacting power that currently lack theoretical guidance. In a multivariate normal means model, we derive asymptotic power formulas for prototypical methods from each paradigm -- variants of sample splitting, conformal-style null augmentation, and resampling-based post-learning adjustment -- quantifying the power losses incurred by masking at each stage. For these paradigm representatives, we find that post-learning adjustment is most powerful, followed by null augmentation, and then information splitting. Moreover, null augmentation can be nearly as powerful as post-learning adjustment, while avoiding its challenges: the power of the former approaches that of the latter if the number of nulls used for augmentation is a vanishing fraction of the number of hypotheses. We also prove for a tractable proxy that the optimal number of nulls scales as the square root of the number of hypotheses, challenging existing heuristics. Finally, we characterize optimal tuning for information splitting by identifying an optimal split fraction and tying it to the difficulty of the learning problem. These results establish a theoretical foundation for key decisions in the deployment of learn-then-test methods.",

The objective is to reconstruct an unknown initial condition from a near-equilibrium state obtained after 100 explicit forward Euler iterations of the reaction-diffusion equation \\[ u_t - \u03b3\u0394u + \u03ba\\left(u^3 - u\\right)=0. \\] Because this mapping strongly damps high-frequency content, the inverse problem is severely ill-posed and sensitive to noise.\n  Our approach integrates a U-Net generator, a PatchGAN critic with spectral normalization, Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty, and several physics-informed auxiliary terms, including Lyapunov energy matching, distributional statistics, and a crucial forward-simulation penalty. This penalty enforces consistency between the predicted initial condition and its forward evolution under the \\emph{same} forward Euler discretization used for dataset generation. Earlier experiments employing an Eyre-type semi-implicit solver were not compatible with this residual mechanism due to the cost and instability of Newton iterations within batched GPU training.\n  On a dataset of 50k training and 10k testing pairs on $128\\times128$ grids (with natural $[-1,1]$ amplitude scaling), the best trained model attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately \\textbf{0.23988159} on the full test set, with a sample-wise standard deviation of about \\textbf{0.00266345}.

Now we study operators with tangential in tersections of bicharacteristics, as well as with double characteristics for p. We put the pseudodifferential operator on normal form microlocally, and use a model operator, P(h) to test for quasimodes. We demonstrate two cases where this happens. We shall also continue with more advanced cases, when the operators are factorable to P(h) = P2(h)P1(h,B), thus annihilating the subprincipal control over the quasimodes.",
