    "title": "Prolongations of $(3, 6)$-distributions by singular curves",
    "abstract": "A subbundle of rank 3 in the tangent bundle over a 6-dimensional manifold is called a (3, 6)-distribution if its local sections generate the whole tangent bundle by taking their Lie brackets once. An integral curve of a distribution, whose velocity vectors belong to the distribution, can be a singular curve or an abnormal extremal in the sense of geometric control theory. In this paper, given a (3, 6)-distribution, we prolong it, using the data of singular curves, to a (3,5,7,8)-distribution, to a (3, 5, 7, 8, 9)-distribution which possesses additional pseudo-product structure respectively. Regarding also another prolongation to a (4, 6, 8)-distribution, we show the equivalence of the classification problems of those four classes of distributions obtained from (3, 6)-distributions, generalising the correspondences of those in B_3-SO(3,4)-homogeneous models.",

    "abstract": "Alp\u00f6ge--Bhargava--Shnidman showed that even a strengthened \\emph{no local obstruction} condition for monogenicity does not force a global power integral basis: in the full spaces of cubic and quartic fields, a positive proportion are non-monogenic yet satisfy this ABS fixed-sign condition. This raises a natural family-level question: does the same phenomenon persist inside one-parameter families, where the local structure varies in a highly constrained way?\n  In this paper we answer this in the negative for the pure fields $K_m=\\mathbb Q(\u03b1)$ with $\u03b1^n=m$ ($n\\ge 4$) and $m$ square-free. Writing $g(m)=[\\mathcal O_{K_m}:\\mathbb Z[\u03b1]]$, we prove that the set of square-free $m$ for which $g(m)>1$ but $K_m$ has no ABS local obstruction has natural density $0$. Consequently, in the pure family monogenicity and $\u03b1$--monogenicity have the same natural density. The proof isolates a reusable mechanism, which we call the Eisenstein-prime obstruction sieve. The argument is packaged in an abstract template and transfers to other Eisenstein parameter families.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a systematic study of symmetry properties for cyclotomic multiple Hurwitz zeta values with multiple variables and parameters by applying the methods of contour integration and the residue theorem. The main contributions are the derivation of explicit symmetry formulas for cyclotomic multiple (Hurwitz) zeta values, which are obtained directly through analytic residue calculations, without reliance on algebraic regularization. As a concrete application, we deduce analogous symmetry theorems for cyclotomic multiple zeta values and cyclotomic multiple $t$-values. The results extend and complement recent symmetry investigations by Charlton and Hoffman, offering completely explicit and regularization-free formulas in the convergent setting. Moreover, the results of this paper can be used to prove the symmetry conjecture for cyclotomic multiple Hurwitz zeta values with multiple variables and a single parameter. Furthermore, several illustrative corollaries and examples are included, and an open problem concerning possible extensions to other variants of multiple zeta values is posed at the conclusion.",

Using standard explicit integrators leads to a physical time step of sub-pico seconds, which is often two orders of magnitude smaller than the fastest physical time scales. Direct implicit integrators require solving complicated, coupled systems. Another major difficulty with the projection method in this field is the lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees regarding its stability of the projection step. In this paper, we introduce a first order method. Such a method is structure preserving based on a combination of a Gauss-Seidel iteration, a double diffusion iteration and a Crank-Nicolson iteration to preserve the norm constraints.",

For the linear system without rotation, stratification not only suppresses the lift-up effect but also exhibits certain dispersion effects, except for some points where degradation occurs, which will bring essential difficulties to nonlinear estimates. In contrast, when rotation is taken into account, we observe that this degeneracy in dispersion effects disappears; furthermore, we can derive dispersive estimates for the second and third components of the simple-zero mode within the velocity field. Additionally, we develop three good unknowns to minimize linear coupling terms as much as possible while mitigating growth induced by linear stretching terms; through constructing a series of multipliers, we achieve enhanced dissipation and inviscid damping effects. In our analysis of the nonlinear system aimed at establishing an improved stability threshold, we utilize quasi-linearization methods to rectify deficiencies in dispersive estimates related to both the first component of velocity and temperature, as well as address regularity issues along vertical directions caused by buoyancy forces and stratification. Consequently, we demonstrate that if initial perturbations in velocity and temperature satisfy $\\left\\|u_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\|_{H^{N+2}\\cap W^{N+3,1}}+\\left\\|\u03b8_{\\mathrm{in}}\\right\\|_{H^{N+1}\\cap W^{N+3,1}}<\u03b4\\mathbf{Re}^{-\\frac{14}{15}}$, for any $N\\geq 11$ and some $\u03b4>0$ independent of $\\mathbf{Re}$, then the solution to the 3D Boussinesq equations with rotation is nonlinearly stable without transitioning away from the steady state.",

This system is hyperbolic, but not strictly hyperbolic, and couples two non-local transport equations. It is characterized by weak regularity in both the velocity and the initial data. We propose a semi-explicit finite difference (IMEX) numerical scheme for the discretization of this system, after regularizing the singular velocity using a Fej\u00e9r kernel. We show that this scheme preserves, at the discrete level, an entropy estimate on the gradient, which then allows us to establish the convergence of the discrete solution to the continuous solution. To our knowledge, this is the first convergence result obtained for this type of system. We conclude with some numerical illustrations highlighting the performance of the proposed scheme.",

In particular, we derive explicit conversion formulas between full-space and subspace models, including minimum-norm models, minimum Frobenius norm models, least Frobenius norm updating models, as well as models constructed via generalized simplex gradients and Hessians.

    "abstract": "We develop an efficient, unconditionally stable, variable step second order exponential time differencing scheme for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in two and three spatial dimensions under periodic boundary conditions, together with an embedded adaptive time stepping variant. The scheme is unconditionally uniform in time stable in the sense that the numerical solution admits a time uniform bound in Linfinity over time with values in L2 to the power d whenever the external forcing term is uniformly bounded in time in L2, for all Reynolds numbers and for arbitrary choices of time step sizes.\n  At each time step, the method requires the solution of two time dependent Stokes problems, which can be evaluated explicitly in the periodic setting using Fourier techniques, along with the solution of a single scalar cubic algebraic equation. Beyond the standard exponential time differencing framework, the proposed scheme incorporates two recently developed ingredients. The first is a dynamic second order scalar auxiliary variable correction, which is essential for achieving second order temporal accuracy. The second is a mean reverting scalar auxiliary variable multistep formulation, which plays a central role in ensuring long time stability.\n  The proposed methods overcome key limitations of existing approaches for the Navier Stokes equations. Classical Runge Kutta schemes generally lack provable long time stability, while IMEX and scalar auxiliary variable based BDF methods typically do not admit unconditional stability guarantees in the variable step setting. Numerical experiments in two spatial dimensions confirm second order temporal accuracy, uniform long time stability, and effective error control provided by the adaptive strategy. Rigorous convergence analysis and a systematic investigation of long time statistical properties will be pursued in future work.",

This result is one of the most powerful computational tools in the study of modular forms, and has widespread applications to congruences and other kinds of explicit calculations in mathematics and physics. In this paper, we formulate a new ``$p$-adic transfer method\" that lifts Sturm-type bounds from one space to another using exclusively non-geometric inputs. As an application, we transfer the Sturm bounds for classical modular forms to the space of quasimodular forms of level one. These bounds are applicable uniformly for quasimodular forms with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$ or $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$, which extends the non-uniform results for $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ only which can be derived from classical theories.

Initially, they converge towards a solution at a sublinear rate. Then, after a certain point, the method identifies the set of active constraints and the convergence enters a faster local linear regime. Theory characterizing this phenomenon spans over three decades. However, most existing work only guarantees eventual identification of the active set and relies heavily on nondegeneracy conditions, such as strict complementarity, which often fail to hold in practice. We characterize mild conditions on the problem geometry and the algorithm under which this phenomenon provably occurs. Our guarantees are entirely nonasymptotic and, importantly, do not rely on strict complementarity. Our framework encompasses several widely-used algorithms, including the proximal point method, the primal-dual hybrid gradient method, the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the extragradient method.",

More precisely, we measure the delocalization level of a vector $x\\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ using the Inverse Participation Ratio $\\mathrm{IPR}(x) = N|x|_4^4 / |x|_2^4 \\geqslant 1$. A higher IPR means a more localized vector.

The corresponding Wiener--Hopf formulation leads to an equation with a $4 \\times 4$ matrix kernel, which reduces to a $2 \\times 2$ matrix kernel under some symmetry assumptions. The factorisation prospects of this kernel are discussed, but this route is not followed. Instead, an exact analytical solution is obtained using the pole removal technique. This contrasts with the continuous case, where only approximate solutions are currently available. The reflection and transmission coefficients resulting from an incident duct mode are computed with an accuracy up to $10^{-13}$, showing consistency with theoretical predictions from continuous waveguide theory. In particular, full reflection and zero transmission are recovered as the frequency approaches the cut-off value for the incident mode. Finally, the solution is validated against a numerical computation of the diffraction problem via the Boundary Algebraic Equations method with a tailored lattice Green's function.",

However, the variance of the imbalance of the unspecified covariates may be inflated comparing to the one under the simple randomization. The inflation of the variance causes the usual test of treatment effects being not valid and adjusting the test being not an easy work. In this paper, we propose a new kind covariate adaptive randomization procedures to balance covariates between two treatments with a ratio $\u03c1:(1-\u03c1)$. Under this kind of CAR procedures, the convergence rate of the imbalance of the specified covariates is $o(n^{1/2})$, and at the same time the asymptotic variance of the imbalance of any unspecified (observed or unobserved) covariates does not exceed the one under the simple randomization.

    "abstract": "Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) has emerged as a robust relaxation of standard Optimal Transport, particularly effective for handling outliers and mass variations. However, scalable algorithms for UOT, specifically those based on Gradient Descent (SGD), remain largely underexplored. In this work, we address this gap by analyzing the semi-dual formulation of Entropic UOT and demonstrating its suitability for adaptive gradient methods. While the semi-dual is a standard tool for large-scale balanced OT, its geometry in the unbalanced setting appears ill-conditioned under standard analysis. Specifically, worst-case bounds on the marginal penalties using $\u03c7^2$ divergence suggest a condition number scaling with $n/\\varepsilon$, implying poor scalability. In contrast, we show that the local condition number actually scales as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\varepsilon)$, effectively removing the ill-conditioned dependence on $n$. Exploiting this property, we prove that SGD methods adapt to this local curvature, achieving a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(n/\\varepsilon T)$ in the stochastic and online regimes, making it suitable for large-scale and semi-discrete applications. Finally, for the full batch discrete setting, we derive a nearly tight upper bound on local smoothness depending solely on the gradient. Using it to adapt step sizes, we propose a modified Adaptive Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (ANAG) method on the semi-dual functional and prove that it achieves a local complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^2\\sqrt{1/\\varepsilon}\\ln(1/\u03b4))$.",

In this paper, we first provide a general method to obtain an explicit form of the relaxation tensor for inhomogeneous isotropic q-EBM. Then, we apply it to compute the eigenvalues of the free oscillation of Earth, assuming that Earth is a unit ball modeled as a homogeneous and isotropic q-EBM. So far, an analytical and systematic way to compute the eigenvalues of the FOE has been missing when modeling Earth as a q-EBM. In particular, we compute some clusters of eigenvalues (abbreviated by C-ev's). To be more precise, integrating by parts with respect to time of the q-EBM under the assumption that the initial strain is zero, the q-EBM becomes the sum of two terms. The first term, called the instantaneous term, doesn't have any integration with respect to time, but the second term, called the memory term, has such an integration. Then, consider the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part of the q-EBM. The eigenfunctions of C-ev's share the same eigenfunctions of the instantaneous part. However, the C-ev's may be shifted from the eigenvalues of the instantaneous part. Further, we analyze the structure of C-ev's and provide an inversion formula identifying the q-EBM from the C-ev's.",

    "title": "An Energy-Stable, Bound-Preserving and Locally Conservative Numerical Framework for Multicomponent Gas Flow in Poroelastic Media",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a robust and efficient numerical framework for simulating multicomponent gas flow in poroelastic media, with a focus on preserving fundamental thermodynamic principles and ensuring computational reliability. The model captures the complex nonlinear coupling between multicomponent transport and solid deformation, while addressing critical numerical challenges such as mass conservation, energy stability, and molar density boundedness. To achieve this, we develop a stabilized discretization approach that guarantees the preservation of the original energy dissipation law and ensures the boundedness of each gas component's molar density. Furthermore, the proposed method incorporates an adaptive time-stepping strategy that dynamically adjusts the time step size based on the system's dynamics, significantly enhancing computational efficiency without compromising stability or accuracy. For spatial discretization, a mixed finite element method combined with an upwind scheme is employed for the flow and transport equations to ensure local mass conservation, while a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method is utilized for discretizing the momentum equation of poroelasticity to effectively overcome numerical locking phenomena. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the performance, robustness, and applicability of the method in simulating multicomponent gas flow under various scenarios.",

For chain complexes of length $1$ or $2$, we characterize the Betti numbers almost surely, in terms of the dimensions of the vector spaces. We further examine complexes of length $3$ with some constraints on dimensions, as well as complexes of arbitrary finite length in which all vector spaces have equal dimension. Across all these settings, we show that the sum of the Betti numbers is almost surely as small as possible, attaining a trivial lower bound $|\u03c7|$ dictated by the dimensions of the underlying vector spaces and the Euler formula. These results suggest an underlying algebraic heuristic for a phenomenon frequently observed in stochastic topology, that nontrivial homology rarely appears unless forced to.",

    "abstract": "When particles on a line collide, they may coalesce into one. Such systems model diverse phenomena, from voter dynamics and opinion formation to ancestral lineages in population genetics. Computing exact coalescence probabilities has been difficult because collisions reduce the particle count, while classical determinantal methods require a fixed count throughout. We introduce ghost particles: when two particles merge, the discarded trajectory continues as an invisible walker. Ghosts restore the missing dimension, enabling an exact determinantal formula. We prove that the probability of any specified coalescence pattern is given by a determinant. Integrating out ghost positions yields a closed-form ghost-free formula for the surviving particles. The framework applies to discrete lattice paths, birth-death chains, and continuous diffusions including Brownian motion.",

Since most stochastic techniques used for approximating the solution of a stochastic differential equation may have lower order compared to the deterministic case, we have elaborated a scheme which not only preserves the second-order accuracy of the original scheme in the stochastic framework, but also its $A$-stability. Once we obtain the scheme and prove its second-order accuracy and $A$-stability, which is not a trivial task, we also state a result concerning its $MS$-stability. This concept is also analyzed for different parameter ranges in our scheme and the It{\u00f4}--Taylor approximation of order 2, revealing scenarios where, for certain time step sizes, the developed method is $MS$-stable while the It{\u00f4}--Taylor one is not. This concept is really useful to tackle slow-fast problems such as stiff ones, which we aim to explore further in future work. Finally, we validate the theoretical results with some academic test cases.",

The rapid fluctuation of the air-to-ground (A2G) link creates a regime where reliable transmission slots are intermittent and future channel quality can only be predicted with uncertainty. Conventional deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) methods transmit coupled feature streams, causing global reconstruction failure when specific time slots experience deep fading. Decoupling semantic content into a deterministic structure component and a stochastic texture component enables differentiated error protection strategies aligned with channel reliability. A predictive transmission framework is developed that utilizes a split-stream variational codec and a channel-aware scheduler to prioritize the delivery of structural layout over reliable slots. Experimental evaluations indicate that this approach achieves a 5.6 dB gain in peak signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio over single-stream baselines and maintains structural fidelity under significant prediction mismatch.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies distributed online convex optimization with time-varying coupled constraints, motivated by distributed online control in network systems. Most prior work assumes a separability condition: the global objective and coupled constraint functions are sums of local costs and individual constraints. In contrast, we study a group of agents, networked via a communication graph, that collectively select actions to minimize a sequence of nonseparable global cost functions and to stratify nonseparable long-term constraints based on full-information feedback and intra-agent communication. We propose a distributed online primal-dual belief consensus algorithm, where each agent maintains and updates a local belief of the global collective decisions, which are repeatedly exchanged with neighboring agents. Unlike the previous consensus primal-dual algorithms under separability that ask agents to only communicate their local decisions, our belief-sharing protocol eliminates coupling between the primal consensus disagreement and the dual constraint violation, yielding sublinear regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bounds, both in $O({T}^{1/2})$, where $T$ denotes the time horizon. Such a result breaks the long-standing $O(T^{3/4})$ barrier for CCV and matches the lower bound of online constrained convex optimization, indicating the online learning efficiency at the cost of communication overhead.",

The primary wave capture structure consists of a flap hinged at the seabed or to a floating platform. Different flap configurations, including single and dual-flap, have been investigated. The separation distance between the oscillating surge wave energy converters can have an impact on their response when deployed in arrays. We consider the case of a dual-flap oscillating surge wave energy converter and investigate the impact of the separation distance between them on the performance of each flap. We estimate the absorbed wave energy and the annual energy production by the two flaps when deployed at the PacWave South site. Inviscid numerical simulations were conducted to predict the response of the oscillating surge wave energy converters. The simulations are validated with experimental measurements of a 1:10 scaled model in a wave tank. The results show that for a short separation distance, the interaction between the oscillating surge wave energy converters has a destructive and constructive effect depending on the wave frequency. However, these effects tend to balance each other out when considering the broad range of wave excitations. For longer separation distances, the interaction always results in a constructive effect. The results reveal that the separation distance has an insignificant impact on annual energy production when considering all wave frequencies and amplitudes.",

The diffusion limits allow us to derive new staffing rules for the probability of delay and the probability of abandonment targets. A key insight is that server stochasticity induces systematic capacity loss relative to fixed--server systems, leading to a regime--dependent staffing adjustment: additive shifts in underloaded regimes and multiplicative scaling in overloaded regimes.

The key challenge stems from the degeneracy of $f(x)$, which leads to a more complex structure of the free boundary compared to the classical setting. To analyze it, we introduce the epiperimetric inequality developed by Weiss (Invent Math 138:23-50, 1999). Although this powerful tool was firstly introduced for the classical obstacle problem characterized by $f(x)>0$ in B_1, it also proves effective in our degenerate setting. This allows us to first obtain the decay rate of the Weiss energy for all blow-ups at the origin, which in turn implies the uniqueness of the blow-up profiles. With this uniqueness established, we then prove a very weak directional monotonicity properties satisfied by the solutions. This finally yields the regularity of the free boundary at the origin if the origin is a regular point.",

    "abstract": "We study the almost sure convergence of the Stochastic Approximation algorithm to the fixed point $x^\\star$ of a nonlinear operator under a negative drift condition and a general noise sequence with finite $p$-th moment for some $p > 1$. Classical almost sure convergence results of Stochastic Approximation are mostly analyzed for the square-integrable noise setting, and it is shown that any non-summable but square-summable step size sequence is sufficient to obtain almost sure convergence. However, such a limitation prevents wider algorithmic application. In particular, many applications in Machine Learning and Operations Research admit heavy-tailed noise with infinite variance, rendering such guarantees inapplicable. On the other hand, when a stronger condition on the noise is available, such guarantees on the step size would be too conservative, as practitioners would like to pick a larger step size for a more preferable convergence behavior. To this end, we show that any non-summable but $p$-th power summable step size sequence is sufficient to guarantee almost sure convergence, covering the gap in the literature.\n  Our guarantees are obtained using a universal Lyapunov drift argument. For the regime $p \\in (1, 2)$, we show that using the Lyapunov function $\\norm{x-x^\\star}^p$ and applying a Taylor-like bound suffice. For $p > 2$, such an approach is no longer applicable, and therefore, we introduce a novel iterate projection technique to control the nonlinear terms produced by high-moment bounds and multiplicative noise.

However, existing approaches implicitly adopt a use-all philosophy, under which incorporating more predictions is presumed to improve inference. When prediction quality is heterogeneous, this assumption can fail, and indiscriminate use of unlabeled data may dilute informative signals and degrade inferential accuracy. In this paper, we propose Filtered Prediction-Powered Inference (FPPI), a framework that selectively incorporates predictions by identifying a data-adaptive filtered region in which predictions are informative for inference. We show that this region can be consistently estimated under a margin condition, achieving fast rates of convergence. By restricting the prediction-powered correction to the estimated filtered region, FPPI adaptively mitigates the impact of biased or noisy predictions. We establish that FPPI attains strictly improved asymptotic efficiency compared with existing prediction-powered inference methods. Numerical studies and a real-data application to large language model evaluation demonstrate that FPPI substantially reduces reliance on expensive labels by selectively leveraging reliable predictions, yielding accurate inference even in the presence of heterogeneous prediction quality.",

    "abstract": "Randomized subspace embedding methods have had a great impact on the solution of a linear least squares (LS) problem by reducing its row dimension, leading to a randomized or sketched LS (sLS) problem, and use the solution of the sLS problem as an approximate solution of the LS problem. This work makes a numerical analysis on the sLS problem, establishes its numerous theoretical properties, and show their crucial roles on the most effective and efficient use of iterative solvers. We first establish a compact bound on the norm of the residual difference between the solutions of the LS and sLS problems, which is the first key result towards understanding the rationale of the sLS problem. Then from the perspective of backward errors, we prove that the solution of the sLS problem is the one of a certain perturbed LS problem with minimal backward error, and quantify how the embedded quality affects the residuals, solution errors, and the relative residual norms of normal equations of the LS and sLS problems. These theoretical results enable us to propose new novel and reliable general-purpose stopping criteria for iterative solvers for the sLS problem, which dynamically monitor stabilization patterns of iterative solvers for the LS problem itself and terminate them at the earliest iteration. Numerical experiments justify the theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the new stopping criteria work reliably and result in a tremendous reduction in computational cost without sacrificing attainable accuracy.",

In the fractional-order setting, the classical principle does not apply directly because fractional derivatives are nonlocal in time. Over the past two decades, several fractional analogues of Duhamel's principle have been developed to address this issue.\n  In this paper, we establish a fractional version of Duhamel's principle for fully coupled systems of fractional differential-operator equations. The result provides a systematic reduction of inhomogeneous fractional problems to homogeneous ones while preserving the structure of the classical method. In the limit of integer-order derivatives, the formulation recovers the classical Duhamel principle and also reveals effects specific to coupled fractional systems, including those produced by coupled fractional impulses.",

This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.",

    "abstract": "Recent random feature methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) reduce computational cost compared to physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) but still rely on iterative optimization or expensive derivative computation. We observe that sinusoidal random Fourier features possess a cyclic derivative structure: the derivative of any order of $\\sin(\\mathbf{W}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}+b)$ is a single sinusoid with a monomial prefactor, computable in $O(1)$ operations. Alternative activations such as $\\tanh$, used in prior one-shot methods like PIELM, lack this property: their higher-order derivatives grow as $O(2^n)$ terms, requiring automatic differentiation for operator assembly. We propose FastLSQ, which combines frozen random Fourier features with analytical operator assembly to solve linear PDEs via a single least-squares call, and extend it to nonlinear PDEs via Newton--Raphson iteration where each linearized step is a FastLSQ solve. On a benchmark of 17 PDEs spanning 1 to 6 dimensions, FastLSQ achieves relative $L^2$ errors of $10^{-7}$ in 0.07\\,s on linear problems, three orders of magnitude more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art iterative PINN solvers, and $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ on nonlinear problems via Newton iteration in under 9s.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes a classification of the critical numbers for restricted sumsets in finite abelian groups, determining them exactly for even-order groups and bounding them for odd-order groups, while revealing a fundamental structural dichotomy governed by parity. For groups of even order, we prove a universal rigidity theorem: the index-$2$ subgroup creates an immutable arithmetic barrier at density $1/2$, fixing the critical number at $|G|/2+1$ regardless of the group's internal structure. In sharp contrast, we demonstrate that for groups of odd order, this barrier vanishes, causing the critical threshold to collapse to significantly lower densities bounded by index-$5$ obstructions or the smallest prime divisor. These results unify and vastly generalize previous work on cyclic groups, providing a definitive structural theory for the transition from sparsity to saturation. As a decisive application, we resolve a conjecture of Han and Ren in algebraic coding theory. By translating the additive rigidity at density $1/2$ into a geometric constraint, we prove that for all sufficiently large $q$, any subset of rational points on an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{F}_q$ generating an MDS code must satisfy the tight bound $|P|\\le|E(\\mathbb{F}_q)|/2$.",

    "abstract": "We describe inexact proximal Newton-like methods for solving degenerate regularized optimization problems and for the broader problem of\n  finding a zero of a generalized equation that is the sum of a continuous map and a maximal monotone operator. Superlinear convergence for both the distance to the solution set and a certain measure of first-order optimality can be achieved under a H\u00f6lderian error bound condition, including for problems in which the continuous map is nonmonotone, with Jacobian singular at the solution and not Lipschitz. Superlinear convergence is attainable even when the Jacobian is merely uniformly continuous, relaxing the standard Lipschitz assumption to its theoretical limit. For convex regularized optimization problems, we introduce a novel globalization strategy that ensures strict objective decrease and avoids the Maratos effect, attaining local $Q$-superlinear convergence without prior knowledge of problem parameters. Unit step size acceptance in our line search strategy does not rely on continuity or even existence of the Hessian of the smooth term in the objective, making the framework compatible with other potential candidates for superlinearly convergent updates.",

We study a family of fractional Hardy-type inequalities \\begin{equation} \\frac{c_{N,s}}{2}\\displaystyle\\iint_{\u03a9\\times\u03a9}\\frac{(u(x)-u(y))^2}{|x-y|^{N+2s}}\\ dxdy-\\displaystyle\u03bb\\int_\u03a9u^2\\ dx\\geq C\\displaystyle\\int_\u03a9\\frac{u^2}{\u03b4^{2s}}\\ dx,~~~\\quad\\forall\u03bb\\in\\mathbb{R},~~~~~~~(0.1) \\end{equation} with $u\\in C_c^\\infty(\u03a9)$ and $C=C(\u03a9,s,N,\u03bb)>0$.

As a by-product, we derive in particular that the best constant in Hardy inequality $\u03bc_{N,s}(\u03a9)$ is achieved if and only if $\u03bc_{N,s}(\u03a9)<\\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$, with $\\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$ being the best constant for the fractional Hardy inequality in the half space. Moreover, if $\u03a9$ is a convex open set, we obtain a lower bound for $\u03bb^*(s,\u03a9)$ in terms of the volume of $\u03a9$. Specifically, we prove that $\u03bb^*(s,\u03a9)\\geq a(N,s)|\u03a9|^{-\\frac{2s}{N}}$ with an explicit constant $a(N,s)>0$. For general bounded $C^{1,1}$ open sets, we prove instead that $\u03bb^*(s,\u03a9)\\geq0$ when $s$ is close to $\\frac{1}{2}$. The aforementioned result is proved after showing that $\u03bc_{N,s}(\u03a9)=\\mathfrak{h}_{N,s}$ for $s$ close to $\\frac{1}{2}$. In particular, we deduce that, whenever $s$ is sufficiently close to $\\frac{1}{2}$, the Hardy constant $\u03bc_{N,s}(\u03a9)$ is never achieved, hence, behaves differently from that in the local case. This result is completely new in the fractional setting, and was known only for convex open sets for the full range $s\\in(\\frac{1}{2}, 1)$.",

We introduce counter-propagating wave variables with finite propagation speed and recast the optimization problem in terms of scattering relationships between them. This relaxation of the original problem can be interpreted as a physical system that equilibrates and changes its physical properties in order to minimize reflections. We discretize this continuum theory to derive a family of fully unlocked algorithms suitable for training neural networks. Different parameter dynamics, including gradient descent, can be derived by demanding dissipation and minimization of reflections at parameter ports. These results also imply that any physical substrate that supports the scattering and dissipation of waves can be interpreted as solving an optimization problem.",

While sharp upper bounds have been known for over a decade, the structural characterization of configurations that nearly saturate these bounds has remained completely open.\n  Specifically, if a configuration of points $P \\subset \\mathbb{F}_q^d$ and spheres $\\mathscr{S}$ exceeds the random incidence baseline by a factor $K$ in the moderate-sphere regime, then there exists a subset $P' \\subset P$ of size \\[ |P'| \\gtrsim K q^{(d-1)/2} \\] contained in the zero set of a polynomial $F$ of degree at most $C K^C$. This yields a one-sided result: we identify necessary algebraic obstructions to extremality, without asserting sufficiency.\n  The proof introduces a new rigidity mechanism for finite-field incidence geometry. Near-extremality manifests as persistent overlap among bisector hyperplanes. We prove that such persistent coincidence cannot occur without forcing the emergence of bounded-complexity algebraic certificates. The argument proceeds by isolating high-overlap layers via energy stratification, followed by a projective polynomial dichotomy applied to the set of normal directions.\n  As applications, we obtain the first inverse-type results for pinned distance and dot-product problems over finite fields, resolving structural questions inaccessible to standard polynomial or Fourier-analytic methods.",

Existing studies rely on interference-nulling beamforming, precoding, or exclusion zones that require accurate channel state information (CSI) and static coordination, making them unsuitable for dynamic NTN scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we develop an optimization framework that jointly controls TN downlink power, uplink power, and antenna downtilt to protect NTN links while preserving terrestrial performance. The resultant non-convex coupling between TN and NTN parameters is addressed by a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning method that develops adaptive power and tilt control strategies. Simulation results demonstrate a reduction up to 8 dB in the median interference-to-noise ratio (INR) while maintaining over 87% TN basestation activity, outperforming conventional baseline methods and validating the feasibility of the proposed strategy for FR3 coexistence.",

Motivated by a discretised version of the Hammersley--Aldous--Diaconis process, we introduce a partially asymmetric long range misanthrope process (PALRMP) on a finite one-dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions where particles can move between sites that are not necessarily neighbours, as long as there are no particles in between the departure and arrival sites. In this model, each site $\\ell$ has an inhomogeneous rate parameter $x_\\ell$ associated to it, and the hop rate of a particle moving from site $k$ to site $\\ell$ depends upon the parameter associated to the target site $x_\\ell$, the direction the particle moves, and the number of particles at sites $k$ and $\\ell$. We also consider the homogeneous PALRMP, where all the $x_\\ell$'s are 1. We find necessary and sufficient conditions on the hop rates under which the stationary distribution is of factorised form for both the PALRMP and the homogeneous PALRMP, as well as the extreme variants, namely the ones where the particle motion is totally asymmetric (TALRMP) and symmetric (SLRMP).

Moreover, the relative entropy and the $\\|\\cdot\\|_{\u03b4,k*}$-distance induced by $\\tilde W^{-\u03b4,k}$ are estimated for the time-marginal distributions of solutions by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions, which describe the regularity of the solution in initial distribution.

    "abstract": "Given partial information about a set, we are interested in fully recovering the original set from what is given. If a set encodes itself robustly, any partial information about the set suffices to fully recover the information about the original set. Jockusch defined a set $A$ to be introenumerable if each infinite subset of $A$ can enumerate $A$, and this is an example of a set which encodes itself. There are several other notions capturing self-encoding differently. We say $A$ is uniformly introenumerable if each infinite subset of $A$ can uniformly enumerate $A$, whereas $A$ is introreducible if each infinite subset of $A$ can compute $A$. We investigate properties of various notions of self-encoding and prove new results on their interactions. Greenberg, Harrison-Trainor, Patey, and Turetsky showed that we can always find some uniformity from an introenumerable set. We show that this can be reversed: we can construct an introenumerable set by patching up uniformity. This gives a rise to a new method of constructing a nontrivial introenumerable or introreducible set.",

    "title": "Enormous Fluid Antenna Systems (E-FAS) for Multiuser MIMO: Channel Modeling and Analysis",
    "abstract": "Enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS), the system concept that utilizes position reconfigurability in the large scale, have emerged as a new architectural paradigm where intelligent surfaces are repurposed from passive smart reflectors into multi-functional electromagnetic (EM) interfaces that can route guided surface waves over walls, ceilings, and building facades, as well as emit space waves to target receivers. This expanded functionality introduces a new mode of signal propagation, enabling new forms of wireless communication. In this paper, we provide an analytical performance characterization of an E-FAS-enabled wireless link. We first develop a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model that couples a surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading on both the base station (BS)-surface and launcher-user segments. We illustrate that the resulting effective BS-user channel remains circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with an enhanced average power that explicitly captures surface-wave attenuation and junction losses. For single-user cases with linear precoding, we derive the outage probability and ergodic capacity in closed forms, together with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics that quantify the gain of E-FAS over purely space-wave propagation. For the multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and obtain tractable approximations for the ergodic sum-rate, explicitly revealing how the E-FAS macro-gain interacts with the BS spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). In summary, our analysis shows that E-FAS preserves the diversity order dictated by small-scale fading while improving the coding gain enabled by cylindrical surface-wave propagation.",

We show that, under appropriate scaling, both the intensity processes and the rescaled Hawkes processes converge to a mean-reverting, time-inhomogeneous rough fractional square-root process and its integrated counterpart, respectively. In particular, when the original Hawkes process has a stationary first moment (constant marginal mean), the limiting process takes the form of a time-inhomogeneous rough fractional Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) equation with a constant mean-reversion parameter and a time-dependent diffusion coefficient. This class of equations is particularly appealing from a practical perspective, especially for the so-called $\\textit{fake stationary rough Heston}$ model. We further investigate the properties of such limiting scaled time-inhomogeneous Volterra equations, including moment bounds, path regularity and maximal inequality in the $L^p$ setting for every $p>0$.",

Instead, some of the additional assumptions which are usually made in the physics literature turn out to be an a posteriori consequence in our approach.

Previous approaches for the construction of SBP operators have usually relied on either local methods or sparse differentiation matrices, as commonly used in finite difference schemes. However, these methods often impose implicit requirements that are not part of the formal SBP definition. We demonstrate that adherence to the SBP definition alone does not guarantee the desired accuracy, and we identify conditions for SBP operators to achieve both accuracy and stability. Specifically, we analyze the error minimization for an augmented basis, discuss the role of sparsity, and examine the importance of nullspace consistency in the construction of SBP operators. Furthermore, we show how these design criteria can be integrated into a recently proposed optimization-based construction procedure for function space SBP (FSBP) operators on arbitrary grids. Our findings are supported by numerical experiments that illustrate the improved accuracy for the numerical solution using the proposed SBP operators.",

Bern(q) entries. For any fixed edge density p in (0,1) we determine essentially tight thresholds for this problem as a function of d and q. Our results show that the detection problem is substantially easier if the mask is known upfront compared to the case where the mask is hidden.\n  Our analysis is built upon a novel Fourier-analytic framework for bounding signed subgraph counts in Gaussian random geometric graphs that exploits cancellations which arise after approximating characteristic functions by an appropriate power series. The resulting bounds are applicable to much larger subgraphs than considered in previous work which enables tight information-theoretic bounds, while the bounds considered in previous works only lead to lower bounds from the lens of low-degree polynomials. As a consequence we identify the optimal information-theoretic thresholds and rule out computational-statistical gaps. Our bounds further improve upon the bounds on Fourier coefficients of random geometric graphs recently given by Bangachev and Bresler [STOC'24] in the dense, bipartite case. The techniques also extend to sparser and non-bipartite settings, at least if the considered subgraphs are sufficiently small.

In contrast, modern artificial intelligence and communication systems often consume significant energy overheads in transmitting low-level data, with limited emphasis on abstraction. Despite its implicit importance, a formal and computational theory of information abstraction remains absent. In this work, we introduce the Degree of Information Abstraction (DIA), a general metric that quantifies how well a representation compresses input data while preserving task-relevant semantics. We derive a tractable information-theoretic formulation of DIA and propose a DIA-based information abstraction framework. As a case study, we apply DIA to a large language model (LLM)-guided video transmission task, where abstraction-aware encoding significantly reduces transmission volume by $99.75\\%$, while maintaining semantic fidelity. Our results suggest that DIA offers a principled tool for rebalancing energy and information in intelligent systems and opens new directions in neural network design, neuromorphic computing, semantic communication, and joint sensing-communication architectures.",

We show that the diffusion coefficient can be tuned \\emph{a~posteriori} without changing the time-marginal distributions. Among all such tunings, we prove that minimizing the impact of estimation error on the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence selects, in closed form, a F\u00f6llmer process -- a diffusion whose path measure minimizes relative entropy with respect to a reference process determined by the interpolation schedules alone. This yields a new variational characterization of F\u00f6llmer processes, complementing classical formulations via Schr\u00f6dinger bridges and stochastic control. We further establish that, under this optimal diffusion coefficient, the path-space Kullback--Leibler divergence becomes independent of the interpolation schedule, rendering different schedules statistically equivalent in this variational sense.",

    "abstract": "On-time performance is a critical challenge in the airline industry, leading to large operational and customer dissatisfaction costs. The tail assignment problem builds the sequences of flights or routes followed by individual airplanes. While airlines cannot avoid some sources of delay, choosing routes wisely limits propagation along these. This paper addresses the stochastic tail assignment problem at Air France. We propose a column generation approach for this problem. The key ingredient is the pricing algorithm, which is a stochastic shortest path problem. We use dedicated bounds to discard paths in an enumeration algorithm, and introduce new bounds based on a lattice ordering of the set of piecewise linear convex functions to strike a balance between bounds quality and computational cost. A diving heuristic enables us to retrieve integer solutions. Numerical experiments on real-world Air France instances demonstrate that our algorithms lead to an average 0.28% optimality gap on instances with up to 600 flight legs in a few hours of computing time. The resulting solutions effectively balance operational costs and delay resilience, outperforming previous approaches based on minimum turn time.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an efficient numerical method to address a thermodynamically consistent gas flow model in porous media involving compressible gas and deformable rock. The accurate modeling of gas flow in porous media often poses significant challenges due to their inherent nonlinearity, the coupling between gas and rock dynamics, and the need to preserve physical principles such as mass conservation, energy dissipation and molar density boundedness. The system is further complicated by the need to balance computational efficiency with the accuracy and stability of the numerical scheme. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a stabilization approach that is able to preserve the original energy dissipation while achieving linear energy-stable numerical schemes. We also prove the convergence of the adopted linear iterative method. At each time step, the stabilization parameter is adaptively updated using a simple and explicit formula to ensure compliance with the original energy dissipation law. The proposed method uses adaptive time stepping to improve computational efficiency while maintaining solution accuracy and boundedness. The adaptive time step size is calculated explicitly at each iteration, ensuring stability and allowing for efficient handling of highly dynamic scenarios. A mixed finite element method combined with an upwind scheme is employed as spatial discretization to ensure mass conservation and stability. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to validate the performance and robustness of the proposed numerical method.",

The $\u03b1$-Ham-Sandwich theorem gives a sufficient condition for the existence of biased cuts, i.e., hyperplanes that do not cut off half but some prescribed fraction of each point set. We give two new proofs for this theorem. The first proof is completely combinatorial and highlights a strong connection between the $\u03b1$-Ham-Sandwich theorem and Unique Sink Orientations of grids. The second proof uses point-hyperplane duality and the Poincar\u00e9-Miranda theorem and allows us to generalize the result to and beyond oriented matroids. For this we introduce a new concept of rainbow arrangements, generalizing colored pseudo-hyperplane arrangements. Along the way, we also show that the realizability problem for rainbow arrangements is $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$-complete, which also implies that the realizability problem for grid Unique Sink Orientations is $\\exists \\mathbb{R}$-complete.",

This fundamental difference explains the Lindley paradox and establishes the risk-theoretic superiority of Bayesian procedures over fixed-$\u03b1$ Neyman-Pearson tests.

We investigate two classes of hyperbolic models: one describing viscoelasticity with linear dissipation, and the other non-Newtonian fluids asymptotically converging to a power-law behavior. For viscoelastic models, the weaker K-condition is always satisfied and acceleration waves remain bounded. For non-Newtonian fluids, the validity of the condition depends on the power-law index $m$: it holds for Newtonian fluids ($m=1$), is violated for shear-thinning fluids ($m<1$), and leads to an instantaneous regularization of acceleration waves for shear-thickening fluids ($m>1$).",

They further discussed a potential extension of the randomized method to SEEs with multiplicative noise and introduced the so-called drift-randomized Milstein-Galerkin finite element fully discrete scheme, but without providing a corresponding strong convergence analysis.\n  This paper aims to fill this gap by rigorously analyzing the strong convergence behavior of the drift-randomized Milstein-Galerkin finite element scheme. By avoiding the use of differentiability assumptions on the nonlinear drift term, we establish strong convergence rates in both space and time for the proposed method.
