    "abstract": "A Boolean lattice $\\mathcal{B}_n=(2^X, \\leq)$ is the power set of an $n$-element ground set $X$ equipped with inclusion relation.

As the application of these results, we give exact values and some bounds of Boolean Gallai-Ramsey numbers and Boolean rainbow Ramsey numbers, which improve a result of Chen, Cheng, Li, and Liu in 2020 and give an answer of a question proposed by Chang, Gerbner, Li, Methuku, Nagy, Patk\u00f3s, and Vizer in 2022.",

    "title": "Deterministic Zeroth-Order Mirror Descent via Vector Fields with A Posteriori Certification",
    "abstract": "We develop a deterministic zeroth-order mirror descent framework by replacing gradients with a general vector field, yielding a vector-field-driven mirror update that preserves Bregman geometry while accommodating derivative-free oracles. Our analysis provides a unified evaluation template for last-iterate function values under a relative-smoothness-type inequality, with an emphasis on trajectory-wise (a posteriori) certification: whenever a verifiable inequality holds along the realized iterates, we obtain explicit last-iterate guarantees. The framework subsumes a broad class of information-geometric algorithms, including generalized Blahut-Arimoto-type updates, by expressing their dynamics through suitable choices of the vector field. We then instantiate the theory with deterministic central finite differences in moderate dimension, where constructing the vector field via deterministic central finite differences requires 2d off-center function values (and one reusable center value), i.e., 2d+1 evaluations in total, where d is the number of input real numbers. In this deterministic finite-difference setting, the key interface property is not classical convexity alone but a punctured-neighborhood generalized star-convexity condition that isolates an explicit resolution-dependent error floor. Establishing this property for the finite-difference vector field reduces to a robust conic dominance design problem; we give an explicit scaling rule ensuring the required uniform dominance on a circular cone. Together, these results expose a hidden geometric structure linking Bregman telescoping identities, deterministic certification, and robust conic geometry in zeroth-order mirror descent.",

Our first main result gives a closed formula for this vector-valued period polynomial. The identity component of this formula is particularly explicit: it separates as the sum of a finite \\textit{algebraic part} coming from some binary forms and a \\textit{zeta part} involving the values at $s=k$ of certain zeta functions. Using this formula together with a symmetry of vector-valued period polynomials, we explicitly evaluate, for odd $k$, the difference between the zeta values corresponding to the two choices of square root of $D$ modulo $4N$, in terms of Bernoulli numbers and a finite quadratic-form sum. Finally, under a vanishing condition on Fricke-invariant cusp forms at lower levels, we obtain a finite divisor-sum formula for the Dedekind zeta values $\u03b6_{\\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{D})}(k)$ at even integers $k$.",

    "abstract": "Spacecraft rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) pose safety risks to high-value assets, so formal safety guarantees are critical. Yet conservative safety controllers can reduce mission efficiency. We propose a unified two-stage reinforcement learning (RL) framework that addresses two complementary limitations of Input-Constrained Control Barrier Functions (ICCBFs) for safety-critical, fuel-limited spacecraft control. Given a certified safe set S, ICCBFs guarantee forward invariance of an inner set C* under input bounds, but the resulting per-step quadratic programme (QP) is greedy and fuel-inefficient within C*, and recoverable states outside C* are conservatively discarded. Stage 1 learns state-dependent class-K-infinity parameters that adapt ICCBF/CLF decay rates, embedding long-horizon cost awareness while preserving invariance in C*. Stage 2 learns a residual barrier h_RL(x) that certifies recoverability for a subset of S minus C*. At run time, the controller selects the appropriate barrier formulation (Stage 1 or Stage 2) and solves a lightweight ZOH QP. Both stages are trained with PPO using rewards that penalise constraint violations, control effort, and task metrics. We evaluate three benchmarks: cruise control, spacecraft rendezvous with a rotating target, and inspection that maximises observability subject to keep-in and keep-out zone constraints. Across test cases, the method reduces median fuel relative to ICCBF baselines by 12 to 25 percent and increases the fraction of trajectories that remain in S by 7 to 8 percent, while retaining real-time QP complexity.",

This approach uses minimax optimal strategies of the players. Once the weights on the edges are determined, we observe that they correspond to solving a set of linear equations with as many equations as there are cycles. This is very surprising, because there are many more cycles than unknowns. Moreover we analyze other, related games on graphs.",

If $G$ is a classical group, we also show that the restriction of the Hitchin map to the locus of generically semisimple Higgs bundles in $M^d$ factors through an abelian fibration. The abelianised fibres can be described using a generalisation of the cameral data of Donagi and Gaitsgory.\n  We apply these constructions to $G_\\mathbb{R}$-Hitchin fibrations for real forms $G_\\mathbb{R}$. In particular we give a cameral description for an abelianisation of the $G_\\mathbb{R}$-Hitchin fibration, which extends the known description in the quasi-split case. We determine this explicitly in the examples $G_\\mathbb{R} = SU(p,q)$ and $G_{\\mathbb{R}} = SO^*(4m+2)$. Our local results also give a connection between the geometry of the Hitchin fibration on $M^d$ and the representation theory of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{g}$, via the orbit method.

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in online marketplaces such as ride-hailing platforms and payment channel networks, we study a single-server queue with state-dependent arrival control. The service operator dynamically chooses the arrival rate as a function of the current queue length and receives a reward determined by the induced rate, capturing objectives such as throughput, revenue, or social welfare. The goal is to design control policies that simultaneously achieve high long-run operating reward and low congestion, measured by the expected steady-state queue length.\n  We adopt a regret-based framework relative to an optimal benchmark and characterize the efficiency--reward trade-off under an $\\varepsilon$-optimal reward constraint. Our results reveal a sharp dichotomy between small-market and large-market regimes. In small markets, including state-independent policies, any admissible control incurs poor efficiency, with the expected queue length growing on the order of $1/\\varepsilon$. In contrast, in large markets, state-dependent policies can achieve substantially better performance. When the reward function exhibits sufficient curvature, the optimal queue length scales as $\u0398(1/\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$; otherwise, it scales as $\u0398(\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$.\n  For each regime, we establish universal lower bounds on the achievable efficiency and construct simple state-dependent policies that attain these bounds. Our results provide a non-asymptotic heavy-traffic characterization for queues with dynamic arrivals and offer structural insights into the design of efficient pricing and admission control policies.",

    "title": "Improving Minimax Estimation Rates for Contaminated Mixture of Multinomial Logistic Experts via Expert Heterogeneity",
    "abstract": "Contaminated mixture of experts (MoE) is motivated by transfer learning methods where a pre-trained model, acting as a frozen expert, is integrated with an adapter model, functioning as a trainable expert, in order to learn a new task. Despite recent efforts to analyze the convergence behavior of parameter estimation in this model, there are still two unresolved problems in the literature. First, the contaminated MoE model has been studied solely in regression settings, while its theoretical foundation in classification settings remains absent. Second, previous works on MoE models for classification capture pointwise convergence rates for parameter estimation without any guaranty of minimax optimality. In this work, we close these gaps by performing, for the first time, the convergence analysis of a contaminated mixture of multinomial logistic experts with homogeneous and heterogeneous structures, respectively. In each regime, we characterize uniform convergence rates for estimating parameters under challenging settings where ground-truth parameters vary with the sample size. Furthermore, we also establish corresponding minimax lower bounds to ensure that these rates are minimax optimal. Notably, our theories offer an important insight into the design of contaminated MoE, that is, expert heterogeneity yields faster parameter estimation rates and, therefore, is more sample-efficient than expert homogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Vector extrapolation methods are widely used in large-scale simulation studies, and numerous extrapolation-based acceleration techniques have been developed to enhance the convergence of linear and nonlinear fixed-point iterative methods. While classical extrapolation strategies often reduce the number of iterations or the computational cost, they do not necessarily lead to a significant improvement in the accuracy of the computed approximations. In this paper, we study the combination of preconditioned gradient-based methods with extrapolation strategies and propose an extrapolation-accelerated framework that simultaneously improves convergence and approximation accuracy. The focus is on the solution of nonlinear least-squares problems through the integration of vector extrapolation techniques with preconditioned gradient descent methods. A comprehensive set of numerical experiments is carried out to study the behavior of polynomial-type extrapolation methods and the vector $\\varepsilon$-algorithm when coupled with gradient descent schemes, with and without preconditioning. The results demonstrate the impact of extrapolation techniques on both convergence rate and solution accuracy, and report iteration counts, computational times, and relative reconstruction errors. The performance of the proposed hybrid approaches is further assessed through a benchmarking study against Gauss--Newton methods based on generalized Krylov subspaces.",

    "abstract": "Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an important role in the low-altitude economy and have been used in various applications. However, with the increasing number of UAVs and explosive wireless data, the existing bit-oriented communication network has approached the Shannon capacity, which cannot satisfy the quality of service (QoS) with ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) requirements for command and control (C\\&C) transmission in bit-oriented UAV communication networks. To address this issue, we propose a novel semantic-aware C\\&C transmission for multi-UAVs under limited wireless resources. Specifically, we leverage semantic similarity to measure the variation in C\\&C messages for each UAV over continuous transmission time intervals (TTIs) and capture the correlation of C\\&C messages among UAVs, enabling multicast transmission. Based on the semantic similarity and the importance of UAV commands, we design a trigger function to quantify the QoS of UAVs. Then, to maximize the long-term QoS and exploit multicast opportunities of C\\&C messages induced by semantic similarity, we develop a proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to jointly determine the transmission mode (unicast/multicast/idle) and the allocation of limited resource blocks (RBs) between a base station (BS) and UAVs. Experimental results show that our proposed semantic-aware framework significantly increases transmission efficiency and improves effectiveness compared with bit-oriented UAV transmission.",

In this paper, we study the set of all decomposition lengths of a given numerical semigroup.

    "abstract": "We investigate the parallel one-level overlapping Schwarz method for solving finite element discretization of high-frequency Helmholtz equations. The resulting linear systems are large, indefinite, ill-conditioned, and complex-valued. We present a practical variant of the restricted additive Schwarz method with Perfectly Matched Layer transmission conditions (RAS-PML), which was originally analyzed in a theoretical setting in {\\tt arXiv:2404.02156}, with some numerical experiments given in {\\tt arXiv:2408.16580}. In our algorithm, the width of the overlap and the additional PML layer on each subdomain is allowed to decrease with $\\mathcal{O}(k^{-1} \\log(k))$, as the frequency $k \\rightarrow \\infty$, and this is observed to ensure good convergence while avoiding excessive communication. In experiments, the proposed method achieves $\\mathcal{O}(k^d)$ parallel scalability under Cartesian domain decomposition and exhibits $\\mathcal{O}(k)$ iteration counts and convergence time for $d$-dimensional Helmholtz problems ($d = 2,3$) as $k$ increases. In this preliminary note we restrict to experiments on 2D problems with constant wave speed. Details, analysis and extensions to variable wavespeed and 3D will be given in future work.",

As a main reference, I work with the book by Heckenberger and Schneider, but I want to take a distinct categorical perspective and try to develop the topic for an audience without a background in Hopf algebras. On the other hand I put some emphasis on hands-on examples. My first goal is to explain the definitions and the striking properties of Nichols algebras, foremost the odd reflection theory that is already present in Lie superalgebras. My second goal is to explain how the category of representations of a quantum group can be constructed, using categorical tools, from the Nichols algebra as its centerpiece. This makes the zoo of different existing versions of quantum groups more transparent and allows the construction of many more non-semisimple modular tensor categories. Other topics include different types of examples beyond the diagonal case, categorical versions of some Hopf algebra constructions, and an outlook section on the appearance of Nichols algebras in conformal field theory.",

We establish that for these particular mappings, best proximity points are not necessarily unique; however, we provide an upper bound, proving that at most two such points can exist. To establish the validity of our results, we provide illustrative examples demonstrating that these newly defined mappings can possess unique or exactly two best proximity points.",

The warped product was first introduced by Bishop and O'Neill to study Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature.Warped products have been mainly used to construct new examples of Riemannian manifolds with prescribed curvature conditions. This construction can be extended for Finslerian metrics with some minor restrictions. This is motivated by Asanov's papers, where some models of relativity theory are described through the warped product of Finsler metrics. These metrics are in the form of $(\u03b1,\u03b2)$-metrics, which are the generalization of the Randers metrics; which are being asymmetric Finsler metrics in four-dimensional space-time.

A rigorous proof of confinement for three-dimensional $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ lattice gauge theory with Villain action was given by G\u00f6pfert and Mack.

Indeed, combining a comparison inequality of Fr{\u00f6}hlich with earlier work of Glimm and Jaffe yields confinement with a logarithmically growing quark-antiquark potential for this class of theories. The purpose of this note is to give a short, self-contained proof of this classical result for three-dimensional Wilson lattice gauge theory: when $G\\subseteq \\mathrm{U}(n)$ contains the full circle of scalar matrices $\\{zI:\\ |z|=1\\}$, rectangular Wilson loops obey an explicit upper bound of the form $\\lvert\\langle W_\\ell\\rangle\\rvert \\le n\\exp\\{-c(1+n\u03b2)^{-1}T\\log(R+1)\\}$.",

In the linear setting, the framework recovers the available analytical results, while simultaneously extending them to nonlinear regimes where such results are not readily accessible. We first validate the method using the first-order local Lax-Friedrichs (LLF) discretizations on linear models -- the decoupled wave system and the linearized Saint-Venant equations -- recovering the known stability intervals and mixed boundary couplings reported in the control literature. We then consider nonlinear and stochastic settings, including the nonlinear Saint-Venant system and Burgers equation with random initial data, as well as a nonconservative perturbation with source terms, and demonstrate that the computed stability domains remain accurate and robust with respect to the choice of indicator and the initial prior. We further show that the methodology carries over to a second-order semi-discrete LLF scheme and to a model with two interacting control parameters for the temperature field development in laser powder bed fusion with feedback power regulation. These numerical experiments confirm consistency with available theory on benchmark cases and highlight the practicality of the proposed, discretization-agnostic feedback selection procedure.",

    "abstract": "Recently, versions of neural networks with infinite-dimensional affine operators inside the computational units (``neural operator'' networks) have been applied to learn solutions to differential equations. To enable practical computations, one employs finite-dimensional encoding/decoding theorems of the following kind: every continuous mapping $f$ between function spaces $E$ and $F$ is approximated in the topology of uniform convergence on compacta by continuous mappings factoring through two finite dimensional Banach spaces. Such a result is known (Kovachki et al., 2023) for $E,F$ being Banach spaces having the approximation property. We point out that the result needs no assumptions on $E,F$ whatsoever and remains true not only for all normed spaces, but for arbitrary locally convex spaces as well. At the same time, an analogous result for $C^k$-smooth mappings and the $C^k$ compact open topology, $k\\geq 1$, holds if and only if the space $E$ has the approximation property. This analysis may be useful already because non-normable locally convex function spaces are common in the theory of differential equations, the main field of applications for the emerging theory.",

    "title": "A Hybrid Relaxation-Heuristic Framework for Solving MIP with Binary Variables",
    "abstract": "Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP), particularly Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming (MIQP), has found extensive applications in domains such as portfolio optimization and network flow control, which inclusion of integer variables or cardinality constraints renders these problems NP-hard, posing significant computational challenges. While traditional approaches have explored approximation methods like heuristics and relaxation techniques (e.g. Lagrangian dual relaxation), the integration of these strategies within a unified hybrid framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a generalized hybrid framework to address MIQP problems with binary variables, which consists of two phases: (1) a Mixed Relaxation Phase, which employs Linear Relaxation, Duality Relaxation, and Augmented Relaxation with randomized sampling to generate a diverse pre-solution pool, and (2) a Heuristic Optimization Phase, which refines the pool using Genetic Algorithms and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) to approximate binary solutions effectively. Becuase of the page limit, we will only detailedly evaluate the proposed framework on portfolio optimization problems using benchmark datasets from the OR Library, where the experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the framework's ability to solve larger and more complex MIP problems efficiently. This study offers a robust and flexible methodology that bridges relaxation techniques and heuristic optimization, advancing the practical solvability of challenging MIP problems.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by W. P. Thurston, we ask: What is the shape of a meromorphic function on a simply connected Riemann surface $\u03a9_z$? We consider Speiser functions, i.e. meromorphic functions on a simply connected Riemann surface, that have a finite number $q$ at least 2 of singular (critical or asymptotic) values. As a first result, we make precise the correspondence between: Speiser functions $w(z)$, Speiser Riemann surfaces $R_w(z)$, Speiser $q$-tessellation, and analytic Speiser graphs of index $q$. As the second main result, we characterize tessellations with alternating colors (equivalently abstract pre-Speiser graphs) that are realized by Speiser functions on $\u03a9_z$. The characterization is in terms of the $q$-regular extension problem of bipartite planar graphs. As third main results, the Speiser Riemann surface $R_w(z)$ can be constructed by isometric glueing of a finite number of types of sheets, where each sheet is a maximal domain of single-valuedness of the inverse of $w(z)$. Furthermore, a unique decomposition of $R_w(z)$ into maximal logarithmic towers and a soul is provided. Using vector fields we recognize that logarithmic towers come in two flavors: exponential or $h$-tangent blocks, directly related to the exponential or the hyperbolic tangent functions on the upper half plane. The surface $R_w(z)$ of a finite Speiser function is characterized by surgery of a rational block and a finite number of exponential or $h$-tangent blocks.",

Standard approaches often require multi-step heuristic procedures to recover valid poses, which are difficult to analyze and typically lack theoretical guarantees. This paper adopts a dual quaternion representation and formulates SE(3) synchronization directly over the unit dual quaternion. A two-stage algorithm is developed: A spectral initializer computed via the power method on a Hermitian dual quaternion measurement matrix, followed by a dual quaternion generalized power method (DQGPM) that enforces feasibility through per-iteration projection. The estimation error bounds are established for spectral estimators, and DQGPM is shown to admit a finite-iteration error bound and achieves linear error contraction up to an explicit noise-dependent threshold. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world multi-scan point-set registration demonstrate that the proposed pipeline improves both accuracy and efficiency over representative matrix-based methods.",

These graphs include several well-studied examples: the power graph, enhanced power graph, generating graph, independence graph, and rank graph. In these cases, some results about groups extend to arbitrary algebras unchanged, but others require specific properties of groups, and pose a challenge to researchers.\n  In the next two sections, I will describe some extensions to directed graphs (the directed power graph and the endomorphism digraph) and to simplicial complexes (the independence and strong independence complexes).

Motivated by this contrast, recent work in mechanics has explored embedding information-processing capabilities directly into mechanical structures. However, quantitative frameworks for evaluating such capabilities remain limited. Here we address a foundational question: how does information propagate through a solid body? Using elastic bodies as a model system, we apply information-theoretic tools to treat an elastic domain as an information encoder and quantify how information transmits from applied loads to discrete sensor locations. We further connect these measures to familiar mechanical phenomena, including Saint-Venant's effect and principal stress lines. Moving toward design, we show how geometry and architected materials can tune transmission, enabling elastic domains to either transmit or block information. Overall, this work advances quantifiable metrics and benchmark tasks for mechanical intelligence, supporting comparable designs of mechanically embodied information processing.",

In this paper, we provide a complete structural classification of the hit image within the top layer of Kameko's decomposition, revealing a rigidity phenomenon governed by parity. Specifically, for degrees $d=k+2d_1$ with $d_1=(n-1)(2^k-1)$, let $V$ denote the span of the monotone translates of Kameko's monomial $z_k$. We prove that the intersection of $V$ with the hit subspace is exactly the even-parity hyperplane. Consequently, the quotient $V/(\\text{hits})$ is one-dimensional and is generated by any odd-parity linear combination of these translates. This establishes the \"odd-parity gap\" as the precise obstruction to the hit property in this layer. As an arithmetic consequence of this structural result, we identify a new infinite numerical family with $n=2^r+1$ and $k=n-4$ ($r\\ge 5$) where $\u03b2(d)>n$. This yields a new class of counterexamples to the motivic Peterson-type conjecture, distinct from Kameko's original family.

We instead consider a simultaneous approach that jointly solves the main and secondary VIs. To efficiently handle nonlinear constraints with parameter misspecification, we propose a single-loop inexact Augmented Lagrangian method that simultaneously updates the primal decision variables, dual multipliers, and the misspecified parameter. The method combines a forward-reflected-backward step with an Augmented Lagrangian penalty, and explicitly handles misspecification on both the operator and constraint functions. Moreover, we introduce a relaxed performance metric based on the Minty VI gap combined with an aggregated infeasibility metric. By proving boundedness of the dual iterates, we establish $\\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ ergodic convergence rates for these metrics.

    "abstract": "Neural operators aim to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, but their performance often degrades on complex or irregular geometries due to the lack of geometry-aware representations. We propose the Finite Element Eigenfunction Network (FEENet), a hybrid spectral learning framework grounded in the eigenfunction theory of differential operators. For a given domain, FEENet leverages the Finite Element Method (FEM)toperformaone-timecomputationofaneigenfunctionbasisintrinsictothegeometry. PDE solutions are subsequently represented in this geometry-adapted basis, and learning is reduced to predicting the corresponding spectral coefficients. Numerical experiments conducted across a range of parameterized PDEs and complex two- and three-dimensional geometries, including benchmarks against the seminal DeepONet framework (1), demonstrate that FEENet consistently achieves superior accuracy and computational efficiency. We further highlight key advantages of the proposed approach, including resolution-independent inference, interpretability, and natural generalization to nonlocal operators defined as functions of differential operators. We envision that hybrid approaches of this form, which combine structure-preserving numerical methods with data-driven learning, offer a promising pathway toward solving real-world PDE problems on complex geometries.",

This criterion provides a structural method for the characterization of any unrefinable partition. Using this general framework, we revisit the correspondence results between maximal unrefinable partitions and partitions into distinct parts, previously established using enumerative methods. We provide alternative and purely combinatorial proofs of these bijections, focusing on the rigid symmetry structures of the Young diagrams. In the triangular weight case, we show that the corresponding diagrams are quasi-symmetric, i.e. symmetric up to a single extra column. We extend this analysis to the nontriangular case, showing that the diagrams either exhibit this same quasi-symmetric structure or are perfectly self-conjugate, depending on the maximal part.",

Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) facilitates parallel implementation of GRAND by exploiting log-likelihood ratio (LLR) rankings but still suffers from high tail latency under unfavorable channel conditions, limiting its use in real-time systems.\n  We propose an elimination-aided ORBGRAND scheme that reduces decoding latency by integrating the Rank of the Most Reliable Erroneous (RMRE) bit with a partial Gaussian-elimination (GE) filtering mechanism. The scheme groups and jointly verifies EPs that share the same RMRE, and once a valid EP is identified, the ORBGRAND search is resumed. By leveraging prior GE steps to filter out unnecessary guesses, this approach significantly reduces the number of EPs to be tested, thereby lowering both average and worst-case latency while maintaining error-correction performance.\n  Simulation results show that compared to the original ORBGRAND, the elimination-aided ORBGRAND filters out more than 50\\% of EPs and correspondingly reduce overall computational complexity, all with no loss in block error rate.

Rigid-body motion is enforced by a distributed Lagrange multiplier (DLM) formulation, while the moving fluid domain is treated by an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) mapping. In space, we use isoparametric Taylor-Hood elements to achieve high-order accuracy and to represent curved boundaries and the fluid-particle interface. In time, we employ a high-order partitioned Runge-Kutta strategy in which the mesh motion is advanced explicitly and the coupled physical fields are advanced implicitly, yielding high-order accuracy for the particle trajectory. The fully coupled system is linearized into a generalized Stokes problem subject to distributed constraints of incompressibility and rigid-body motion. We establish well-posedness of this generalized Stokes formulation at both the continuous and discrete levels, providing the stability foundation for operator preconditioning that is robust with respect to key physical and discretization parameters. Numerical experiments on representative benchmarks, including a DLD case, demonstrate high-order convergence for the fluid solution and rigid-body dynamics, as well as robust iterative convergence of the proposed preconditioners.",

    "abstract": "We study fast Monte-Carlo methods for testing irreducibility and detecting arithmetic imprimitivity of polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$. Building on the subset-sum criterion of Pemantle-Peres-Rivin, we develop a probabilistic irreducibility test whose expected running time, measured in the number of primes examined, is logarithmic in the degree for generic inputs. Unlike the standard modular irreducibility test, the method aggregates information from modular factorizations rather than discarding unsuccessful trials.\n  We show that failure of this test, when combined with a standard modular irreducibility certificate, is a strong indicator of non-generic algebraic structure. In particular, it often signals arithmetic imprimitivity of the Galois action. We present an explicit and efficient Monte-Carlo algorithm for detecting such imprimitivity via subfield extraction, yielding constructive algebraic certificates in the imprimitive case. To our knowledge, this is the first practical algorithm for detecting arithmetic imprimitivity of polynomials over $\\mathbb{Q}$ in high degree. We further show that the subset-sum data produced by the Pemantle--Peres--Rivin test provides a warm start for polynomial factorization by sharply restricting the possible degrees of rational factors, significantly accelerating subsequent lifting procedures. The proposed methods are orders of magnitude faster in practice than known deterministic algorithms, and are effective in degrees far beyond the reach of current deterministic techniques.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new functional expansion framework that extends classical ideas beyond the Taylor series. Unlike traditional Taylor expansions based on local polynomial approximations, the proposed approach arises from exact differential identities that link a function and its derivatives through polynomial weight factors. This formulation expresses smooth functions via divergence-based relations connecting derivatives of all orders with systematically scaled polynomial coefficients. This framework provides a natural foundation for constructing high-order numerical quadrature formulas, particularly for multi-dimensional domains. By exploiting the divergence structure, volume integrals are systematically transformed into boundary integrals using the Divergence Theorem, recursively reducing the integration domain from an $n$-dimensional body to its $(n-1)$-dimensional facets, and ultimately to its vertices.\n  The article further enhances the framework's accuracy by introducing a complex-shift technique. It is demonstrated that by positioning the expansion center at specific roots of unity in the complex plane, lower-order error terms are annihilated, yielding high-order real-valued quadrature rules with minimal function evaluations. Additionally, a rigorous geometric analysis of the affine transformations required for surface integration is provided, deriving explicit formulas for the transformation of normal vectors and surface measures. The proposed method offers a robust, systematic, and computationally efficient alternative to tessellation-based quadrature for arbitrary flat-faced polytopes.",

Namely, we study the interaction of a viscous incompressible flow with bulk poroelasticity, via a poroelastic interface. The configuration consists of two 3D toroidal subdomains connected via a plate interface, which permits elastic deformation and perfusive fluid dynamics. The governing dynamics comprise Stokes equations in the bulk fluid region, Biot's equations in the bulk poroelastic region, and the recent poroplate of Mikeli\u0107 at the interface. Coupling occurs on the top and lower surfaces of the plate, and involves conservation of mass, stress balance, and a certain slip condition for the fluid free-flow.\n  We seek strong (and mild) solutions in the Hilbert space framework via the Lumer-Phillips theorem. The resolvent analysis employs a nonstandard mixed variational formulation which captures the complex, multi-physics coupling at the interface. We explicitly characterize the infinitesimal generator associated to the linear Cauchy problem and establish the generation of a $C_0$-semigroup on a suitably chosen finite-energy space. With the semigroup in hand, we may treat elastic nonlinearities for plate displacements through perturbation theory. These result parallel those for Biot-Stokes filtration systems, and complement the recently established weak solution theory for multilayer filtrations. The agency of the semigroup straightforwardly admits structural (plate) nonlinearity into the dynamics. Future stability and regularity analyses for multilayer filtrations are also made possible by these results, as well as a comparison of spectral and regularity properties between filtration configurations, and the elucidation of the mitigating poroplate dynamics as possibly regularizing and stabilizing.",

Historically, the origins of such techniques can be traced back to classical algebraic methods by AlKhwarizmi and early series acceleration techniques by Newton, while systematic approaches emerged in the 20th century with Aitken process and Richardson extrapolation. Later developments, including the Shanks transformation and Wynn epsilon algorithm, provided general frameworks capable of eliminating multiple dominant error components, with deep connections to Pade approximants and rational approximations of generating functions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of classical scalar extrapolation methods, including Richardson extrapolation, Aitken process, Shanks transformation, Wynn epsilon algorithm, and other algorithms. We examine their theoretical foundations, asymptotic error models, convergence properties, numerical stability, and practical implementation considerations. The second part of this work is dedicated to vector extrapolation methods: polynomial based ones and epsilon algorithm generalizations to vector sequences. Additionally, we highlight modern developments such as their applications to iterative solvers, Krylov subspace methods, and large-scale computational simulations. The aim of this review is to provide a unified perspective on scalar and vector extrapolation techniques, bridging historical origins, theoretical insights, and contemporary computational applications.",

This formalism extends the technology of factorization algebras to many new contexts, including those arising in arithmetic quantum field theories.\n  In order to make sense of factorization algebras on a geometric object X, one needs two ingredients. First, one needs an additional piece of structure on X that we call an \"isolability structure.\" This is the data required to say whether two (generalized) points of X are \"distant.\" This is encoded as a functor from a certain combinatorial category of cographs. Second, one needs some sort of sheaf theory. The isolability structure then induces on the category of sheaves a kind of twofold symmetric monoidal structure. Factorization algebras are then defined in terms of this structure.\n  This paper develops this formalism.

However, this property can fail to hold for the features, a distinction that has led to several lines of work aiming to remove the latter assumption of independence present in the early literature, while preserving the original conclusions. Empirical spectral distributions of covariance matrices are key for understanding the data, and their almost sure convergence is oftentimes desirable. The random tensor product model, $X=(x_{i_1}x_{i_2}...x_{i_d})_{1 \\leq i_1<...<i_d \\leq n}$ for $x_1,x_2,\\hspace{0.05cm}...\\hspace{0.05cm},x_n$ i.i.d., introduced by the machine learning community, has a dependence structure for its features far from trivial and has been studied in recent years. When $x_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{E}[x_1^4]<\\infty, \\frac{d}{n^{1/3}}=o(1),$ the empirical spectral distributions of the covariance matrices were proved to converge almost surely to Marchenko-Pastur laws in the random matrix theory regime. This work extends this result to the range $\\frac{d}{n^{1/2}}=~o(1)$ when $x_1$ is symmetric with a subgaussian norm slowly growing in $n$ (the aforesaid range arises naturally, and the result failing when $\\frac{d}{n^{1/2}} \\to \\infty$ appears to be a plausible claim) and shows that similarly to the case with independent features, the almost sure convergence holds under more general conditions on the covariance structure than the isotropic case. The latter result provides a means of deriving convergence for empirical spectral distributions of random matrices, applicable to other models as well so long as their entries exhibit a certain degree of concentration.",

    "abstract": "Large deviations for sums of i.i.d.\\ random variables with stretched-exponential tails (also called Weibull or semi-exponential tails) have been well understood since the 60's, going back to Nagaev's seminal work. Many extensions in the $1$-dimensional setting have been developed since then, showing that such deviations are typically governed by a single big jump. In higher dimensions, a corresponding theory has remained largely undeveloped. This work provides such a multivariate extension and establishes large deviation results for sums of i.i.d.\\ random vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ under fairly general assumptions. Roughly speaking, for some $\u03b1\\in(0,1)$, the log-probability of one random vector divided by $x$ exceeding a threshold $t$ in all components behaves asymptotically, for large $x$, as $x^\u03b1$ times a negative infimum of a function $\\mathcal{J}$. We prove large deviation results for sums of i.i.d.\\ copies, where the rate function is given by a minimization of at most $k$ summands of $\\mathcal{J}$. This establishes a few-big-jumps principle that generalizes the classical $1$-dimensional phenomenon: the deviation is typically realized by \\emph{at most} $k$ independent vectors. The results are applied to absolute powers of multivariate Gaussian vectors as well as to various other examples. They also allow us to study random projections of high-dimensional $\\ell_p^N$-balls, revealing interesting insights about the appearance of light- and heavy-tailed distributions in high-dimensional geometry.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by applications in in-vivo DNA storage, we study codes for correcting duplications. A reverse-complement duplication of length $k$ is the insertion of the reversed and complemented copy of a substring of length $k$ adjacent to its original position, while a palindromic duplication only inserts the reversed copy without complementation. We first construct an explicit code with a single redundant symbol capable of correcting an arbitrary number of reverse-complement duplications (respectively, palindromic duplications), provided that all duplications have length $k \\ge 3\\lceil \\log_q n \\rceil$ and are disjoint. Next, we derive a Gilbert-Varshamov bound for codes that can correct a reverse-complement duplication (respectively, palindromic duplication) of arbitrary length, showing that the optimal redundancy is upper bounded by $2\\log_q n + \\log_q\\log_q n + O(1)$. Finally, for $q \\ge 4$, we present two explicit constructions of codes that can correct $t$ length-one reverse-complement duplications. The first construction achieves a redundancy of $2t\\log_q n + O(\\log_q\\log_q n)$ with encoding complexity $O(n)$ and decoding complexity $O\\big(n(\\log_2 n)^4\\big)$. The second construction achieves an improved redundancy of $(2t-1)\\log_q n + O(\\log_q\\log_q n)$, but with encoding and decoding complexities of $O\\big(n \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(\\log_2 n)\\big)$.",

We study this phenomenon through the noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) of a policy-gradient estimator, defined as the estimator variance (noise) normalized by the squared norm of the true gradient (signal). Our main result is that, for (i) finite-horizon linear systems with Gaussian policies and linear state-feedback, and (ii) finite-horizon polynomial systems with Gaussian policies and polynomial feedback, the NSR of the REINFORCE estimator can be characterized exactly-either in closed form or via numerical moment-evaluation algorithms-without approximation. For general nonlinear dynamics and expressive policies (including neural policies), we further derive a general upper bound on the variance. These characterizations enable a direct examination of how NSR varies across policy parameters and how it evolves along optimization trajectories (e.g. SGD and Adam). Across a range of examples, we find that the NSR landscape is highly non-uniform and typically increases as the policy approaches an optimum; in some regimes it blows up, which can trigger training instability and policy collapse.",

    "abstract": "Designing algorithms that can explore multimodal target distributions accurately across successive refinements of an underlying high-dimensional problem is a central challenge in sampling. Annealed Langevin dynamics (ALD) is a widely used alternative to classical Langevin since it often yields much faster mixing on multimodal targets, but there is still a gap between this empirical success and existing theory: when, and under which design choices, can ALD be guaranteed to remain stable as dimension increases? In this paper, we help bridge this gap by providing a uniform-in-dimension analysis of continuous-time ALD for multimodal targets that can be well-approximated by Gaussian mixture models. Along an explicit annealing path obtained by progressively removing Gaussian smoothing of the target, we identify sufficient spectral conditions - linking smoothing covariance and the covariances of the Gaussian components of the mixture - under which ALD achieves a prescribed accuracy within a single, dimension-uniform time horizon. We then establish dimension-robustness to imperfect initialization and score approximation: under a misspecified-mixture score model, we derive explicit conditions showing that preconditioning the ALD algorithm with a sufficiently decaying spectrum is necessary to prevent error terms from accumulating across coordinates and destroying dimension-uniform control. Finally, numerical experiments illustrate and validate the theory.",

    "abstract": "Entropic regularization provides a simple way to approximate linear programs whose constraints split into two (or more) tractable blocks. The resulting objectives are amenable to cyclic Kullback-Leibler (KL) Bregman projections, with the classical Sinkhorn algorithm for optimal transport (balanced, unbalanced, gradient flows, barycenters, \\dots) as the canonical example. Assuming uniformly bounded primal mass and dual radius, we prove that the dual objective of these KL projections decreases at an $O(1/k)$ rate with a constant that scales only linearly in $1/\u03b3$, where $\u03b3$ is the entropic regularization parameter. This extends the guarantees known for entropic optimal transport to any such linearly constrained problem. Following the terminology introduced in [Chizat et al 2025], we call such rates \"robust\", because this mild dependence on $\u03b3$ underpins favorable complexity bounds for approximating the unregularized problem via alternating KL projections. The crucial aspect of the analysis is that the dual radius should be measured according to a block-quotient dual seminorm, which depends on the structure of the split of the constraint into blocks. As an application, we derive the flow-Sinkhorn algorithm for the Wasserstein-1 distance on graphs. It achieves $\u03b5$-additive accuracy on the transshipment cost in $O(p/\u03b5^{4})$ arithmetic operations, where $p$ is the number of edges.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of determining the worst optimal value and characterizing the corresponding worst-case scenarios in minimum cost network flow problems with interval uncertainty in arc capacities. In this setting, each capacity can take any value within its specified lower and upper bounds. We prove that computing the worst optimal value is a strongly NP-hard problem and remains NP-hard even when restricted to series-parallel graphs. Further, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming formulation that computes the exact worst optimal value, as well as a pseudopolynomial-time algorithm designed for the special case of series-parallel graphs. We also examine the structural properties of the most extremal worst-case scenarios and show that the arcs whose capacities are not fixed at their interval bounds form a forest. This result establishes an upper bound on the number of such arcs, which we show to be tight by constructing a class of instances in which the bound is attained. Finally, we investigate the more-for-less paradox in minimum cost network flow problems with interval capacities, which occurs in instances where increasing the required flow leads to a decrease in the worst-case optimal cost. We provide a general characterization of this phenomenon using augmenting paths and establish a stronger characterization for complete graphs. In addition, we discuss the properties of the cost matrices immune against the paradox and prove that deciding whether a given cost matrix has this property is a strongly co-NP-hard problem.",

In five of the six residue classes, all extremal trees contain only vertices of degrees $1, 2,$ and $6$, while for $n \\equiv 3 \\pmod{6}$ an additional exceptional family arises involving vertices of degree $3$.

The first goal of this paper is to extend this result by treating the case of any natural $m$. The ${}_3F_{2}$ series on the right-hand side is thereby replaced by its perturbation by an explicit characteristic polynomial of degree $2m$, i.e., its coefficients are multiplied by values of this polynomial at nonnegative integers. The second goal of this paper is to make one further step and replace the square of the Gauss function by its product with its perturbation by an arbitrary polynomial of degree $s\\le{2m+1}$. We show that such product remains hypergeometric and find its explicit form in terms of a polynomial perturbation of the ${}_3F_2$ series.

In NLOS, multipath-induced distortions typically degrade Angle-of-Arrivial (AoA) estimation accuracy. Existing BLE direction finding datasets rarely provide tightly controlled, IQ-level paired LOS and NLOS measurements with rigorous statistical validation, and commonly used flat-fading models can be inadequate for cluttered indoor environments exhibiting heavy-tailed power distributions. To address these limitations, we conduct a paired-geometry BLE AoA measurement campaign using an off-the-shelf module, collecting 132000 labeled CTE packets under matched anchor-tag conditions. A robust preprocessing stage removes anomalous CTEs using combined univariate and multivariate criteria. Feature-wise hypothesis tests on IQ-derived power features confirm strong LOS and NLOS separability. All mean differences are statistically significant; additionally, 92 percent of feature-wise variance differences are significant. We further compute L-moment ratios (LMRs) and analyze them in the L-moment Ratio Diagram (LMRD), showing that NLOS subsets exhibit markedly heavier tails and stronger asymmetry than LOS. Kappa-family distributions fitted from LMRs provide substantially improved dual scored L--moment goodness-of-fit (GoF), Specifically, for NLOS, which is the smallest discrepancy in the LMRD and a near-zero standardized L-kurtosis deviation. As a practice, we apply a self-supervised clustering to L-moment statistics, achieving a more separable representation, compared to product moments.",

    "title": "Estimating Conditional Distributions via Sklar's Theorem and Empirical Checkerboard Approximations, with Consequences to Nonparametric Regression",
    "abstract": "We tackle the natural question of whether it is possible to estimate conditional distributions via Sklar's theorem by separately estimating the conditional distributions of the underlying copula and the marginals. Working with so-called empirical checkerboard/Bernstein approximations with suitably chosen resolution/degree, we first show that uniform weak convergence to the true underlying copula can be established under very mild regularity assumptions. Building upon these results and plugging in the univariate empirical marginal distribution functions we then provide an affirmative answer to the afore-mentioned question and prove strong consistency of the resulting estimators for the conditional distributions. Moreover, we show that aggregating our estimators allows to construct consistent nonparametric estimators for the mean, the quantile, and the expectile regression function, and beyond. Some simulations illustrating the performance of the estimators and a real data example complement the established theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the approximation of continuously differentiable functions with high-dimensional input by a composition of two functions: a feature map that extracts few features from the input space, and a profile function that approximates the target function taking the features as its low-dimensional input. We focus on the construction of structured nonlinear feature maps, that extract features on separate groups of variables, using a recently introduced gradient-based method that leverages Poincar\u00e9 inequalities on nonlinear manifolds. This method consists in minimizing a non-convex loss functional, which can be a challenging task, especially for small training samples. We first investigate a collective setting, in which we construct a feature map suitable to a parametrized family of high-dimensional functions. In this setting we introduce a new quadratic surrogate to the non-convex loss function and show an upper bound on the latter. We then investigate a grouped setting, in which we construct separate feature maps for separate groups of inputs, and we show that this setting is almost equivalent to multiple collective settings, one for each group of variables.",

    "abstract": "This article develops a unified framework for the theory of Sobolev spaces on vector bundles over Riemannian manifolds. The analytical core of our approach is a rigorous higher-order geometric integration by parts formula, which characterizes the formal adjoint of the covariant derivative. This identity is established for arbitrary manifolds, requiring no assumptions on completeness or compactness. While these results are fundamental to global analysis, explicit and direct proofs are often elusive in the literature or rely on overly sophisticated machinery that overshadows the underlying geometry. To bridge this gap, we establish sharp local-to-global norm equivalence estimates and provide streamlined, self-contained proofs for the Meyers-Serrin theorem on general manifolds, as well as the Sobolev embedding and Rellich-Kondrashov theorems for the compact case. By prioritizing intrinsic global arguments over ad hoc coordinate patching, this work provides a modern and accessible foundation for the study of Sobolev spaces on bundles.",

Dynamic programming applies and, upon restriction to a finite category, classic search algorithms find the minimal dynamic extension.

In the differential-geometric models of defects that have been adopted since the 1950s, dislocations have been associated with torsion, disclinations with the full curvature, and point defects with the first kind trace of non-metricity. The mainstream formulation exhibits several conceptual and technical shortcomings, most notably a hierarchy inconsistency, the non-exictence of a genuine metric formulation, and the potential emergence of Ostrogradsky-type instabilities. These issues have motivated us to develop a new framework, namely a generalized teleparallel geometric theory of defects. In our model, dislocations are identified with the trace of torsion, disclinations with the second kind trace of the non-metricity, and point defects with the first kind trace of the non-metricity. In addition, we retain the scalar part torsion as a free parameter for describing some possible unknown degrees of freedom in the theory of defects. The proposed geometric theory of defects is free from all of the aforementioned drawbacks and is therefore worthy of further investigation. To ensure the coherence and completeness of the discussion, we begin our analysis with elastic deformations, then summarize the existing metric-affine geometric theory of defects, and finally proceed to our original contribution, namely the new theory introduced here. We formulate the entire theory in Eulerian coordinates. Naturally, all results can be reformulated in Lagrangian coordinates as well. All analyses and formulae are expressed in the language of exterior algebra and are carried out in coordinate-independent orthonormal frames.",

    "abstract": "An interval transportation problem represents a model for a transportation problem in which the values of supply, demand, and transportation costs are affected by uncertainty and can vary independently within given interval ranges. One of the main tasks of solving interval programming models is computing the best and worst optimal value over all possible choices of the interval data. Although the best optimal value of an interval transportation problem can be computed in polynomial time, computing the worst (finite) optimal value was proved to be NP-hard. In this paper, we strengthen a previous result showing a quasi-extreme decomposition for finding the worst optimal value, and building on the result, we design heuristics for efficiently approximating the value. Using a simplified encoding of the scenarios, we first derive a local search method and a genetic algorithm for approximating the worst optimal value. Then, we integrate the two methods into a memetic algorithm, which combines the evolutionary improvement of a genetic algorithm with individual learning implemented via local search. Moreover, we include numerical experiments for a practical comparison of the three different approaches. We also show that the proposed memetic algorithm is competitive with the available state-of-the-art methods for approximating the worst optimal value of interval transportation problems, this is demonstrated by finding the new best solutions for several instances, among others.",

Previously, stubborn polynomials were studied only in the globally nonnegative case, with results restricted to polynomials nonnegative on $\\mathbb{P}^2$. We fully characterize stubborn polynomials on smooth curves, showing that a polynomial on a smooth totally real curve is stubborn if and only if all of its zeros are real. This implies that there exist smooth curves with no stubborn polynomials in low degree, while stubborn polynomials must exist in sufficiently high degrees on curves with positive genus. We explore the much more delicate situation with singular and reducible curves. While being real-rooted always implies being stubborn, there also exist singular curves with no stubborn polynomials at all.\n  We then analyze the case of ternary sextics, i.e.,~polynomials of degree $6$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2$. We prove the Conjecture of Blekherman, Kozhasov, and Reznick that a nonnegative ternary sextic is stubborn if and only if its real delta-invariant is at least 9.

The proof uses a spatial-dynamics Hamiltonian formulation of the travelling-wave equations and a nonlinear change of variables that flattens the free surface while putting the symplectic form into Darboux coordinates. Near a distinguished curve in the vorticity--capillarity parameter space, the linearization has a two-dimensional center subspace; a parameter-dependent center-manifold reduction yields a canonical planar Hamiltonian system. A cubic normal-form expansion and long-wave scaling produce a KdV-type profile equation with a reversible homoclinic orbit, which persists under the full dynamics and generates the solitary-wave solutions.",

In particular, we explicitly compute all the $K$-quadratic points if $[K:\\mathbb{Q}]<8$. Moreover, if the degree of $K$ is odd, we prove that all the $K$-quadratic points corresponds just to the $\\mathbb{Q}$-quadratic points",

    "title": "Evaluation of Electricity Market Clearing Mechanisms via Reinforcement Learning: Prices, Remuneration and Competitive Dynamics",
    "abstract": "The Pay-as-Clear (PaC) mechanism currently used in the European electricity market can generate significant submarginal profits for renewable sources when the clearing price is determined by the marginal offers of gas-fired generation units and the cost of natural gas exceeds certain levels. This exposes consumers to high price volatility related to the cost of natural gas. This report analyzes the recently proposed Segmented Pay-as-Clear (SPaC) mechanism as a market alternative, evaluating its system cost-effectiveness through simulations based on Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning) to model the strategic behavior of operators. Three market models are compared, the two classic Pay-as-Clear (PaC) and Pay-as-Bid (PaB) along with SPaC, under two scenarios: a simplified one based on the 2030 NECP objectives and one built on the portfolios of ten operators obtained from the GME's 2024 public offers. The results show that the SPaC market clearing mechanism reduces intramarginal profits and price volatility compared to PaC, while maintaining fair participation incentives for all operators, and is more robust than PaB to the exercise of market power in oligopolistic contexts. The developed framework can serve as a support tool for regulators and policymakers in the evaluation of proposals for market design reforms.",

In this paper, we develop a unified framework of low-complexity algorithms for SIM-assisted communication systems to address these issues. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step codebook construction (TSCC) method that leverages two-dimensional angular-domain decoupling to transform planar array beamformer design into two independent one-dimensional linear array beamformer design problems, efficiently solved via the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and our proposed majorization-minimization-based proximal distance (PDMM) algorithm. We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels. Finally, a variable decoupling-based block successive upper bound minimization (VD-BSUM) algorithm is proposed to directly solve the QoS-constrained sum-rate maximization problem through closed-form iterative updates with substantially reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving precise beam pattern realization, improved beam training accuracy and angular resolution, and enhanced sum-rate performance.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the Navier-Stokes-Transport (NST) system in the framework of Besov spaces. This system contains of a compressible Navier-Stokes system for the density and momentum of a fluid, and a transport equation for the potential temperature of the fluid. In stark contrast to the well-known Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) system where the temperature satisfies a parabolic type equation providing dissipative effect for the temperature and the density, the temperature in our NST system enjoys a transport equation which precludes a dissipative mechanism for the density, leading to significant different effects to the whole system. We first establish the global well-posedness of strong solutions to the compressible NST system in critical Besov spaces over $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 2$. Furthermore, by introducing the Mach number $\\varepsilon > 0$, we rigorously prove the low Mach number limit as $\\varepsilon \\to 0$, showing that the solutions converge to that of the incompressible inhomogeneous Navier-Stokes system. This singular limit holds globally in time, even for {\\it ill-prepared} initial data. To address the challenge posed by the lack of dissipation on the density and temperature, we develop a refined energy analysis and establish optimal time decay rates for strong solutions in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \\geq 3$. Notably, the density remains uniformly bounded in time, displaying asymptotic behavior fundamentally distinct from that in the NSF system, where the density possesses a dissipative structure via the momentum and temperature equations and exhibits temporal decay.",

This perspective clarifies a mechanism for geometric generalization and reveals a direct connection between operator learning and fast kernel summation methods. Leveraging this connection, we propose a multiscale neural operator inspired by Ewald summation for learning and efficiently evaluating unknown kernel integrals, and we provide theoretical accuracy guarantees for the resulting approximation.

In computations, however, the geometric volume enclosed by the interface -- the region where the order parameter $\u03c6$ is positive -- may drift at finite interface thickness, producing artificial shrinkage or growth even when the sharp-interface limit conserves volume. We revisit and extend the improved-conservation framework of Zhou et al., where one replaces classical mass conservation by the exact conservation of a designed monotone mapping $Q(\u03c6)$ that more accurately approximates a step function. Building on this framework, we (i) carry out the matched-asymptotic analysis in the unscaled physical time formulation, (ii) derive a simplified representation of the first-order inner correction to the interface profile, and (iii) identify an integral-moment cancellation condition that controls the leading geometric-volume defect. This mechanism becomes a practical design rule: we select regularization kernels within parameterized families -- including exponential and Pade-type -- to reach effective higher-order behavior and satisfy the cancellation condition at moderate parameter values. As a result, the proposed kernels achieve formal third-order accuracy in geometric-volume conservation with respect to interface thickness. Finally, we describe an unconditional energy-dissipative numerical discretization that exactly preserves the discrete conserved quantity. Numerical benchmarks on multi-scale droplet coarsening and shape relaxation demonstrate that the moment-balanced kernels virtually eliminate artificial drift and prevent premature extinction of small droplets.",

    "abstract": "Pseudospectral analysis is fundamental for quantifying the sensitivity and transient behavior of nonnormal matrices, yet its computational cost scales cubically with dimension, rendering it prohibitive for large-scale systems. While existing research on scalable pseudospectral computation has focused on exploiting sparsity structures, common in discretizations of differential operators, these approaches are ill-suited for machine learning and data-driven dynamical systems, where operators are typically dense but approximately low-rank. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive low-rank framework that dramatically reduces this computational burden. Our core theoretical contribution is an exact characterization of the pseudospectrum of arbitrary low-rank matrices, reducing the evaluation of resolvent norms to eigenvalue problems of dimension proportional to the rank. Building on this foundation, we derive rigorous inclusion sets for the pseudospectra of general matrices via truncated and randomized low-rank approximations, with explicit perturbation bounds. These results enable efficient estimators for key stability quantities, including distance to instability and Kreiss constants, at a cost that scales with the effective rank rather than the ambient dimension. We further demonstrate how our framework naturally extends to data-driven settings, providing pseudospectral analysis of transfer operators learned from nonlinear and stochastic dynamical systems. Numerical experiments confirm orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving accuracy, opening pseudospectral analysis to previously intractable high-dimensional problems in computational PDEs, control theory, and data-driven dynamics.",

This paper investigates the integration of SIM into multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to enhance physical layer security. A novel system architecture is proposed, wherein each base station (BS) antenna transmits a dedicated single-user stream, while a multi-layer SIM executes wave-based beamforming in the electromagnetic domain, thereby avoiding the need for complex baseband digital precoding and significantly reducing hardware overhead. To maximize the weighted sum secrecy rate (WSSR), we formulate a joint precoding optimization problem over BS power allocation and SIM phase shifts, which is high-dimensional and non-convex due to the complexity of the objective function and the coupling among optimization variables. To address this, we propose a manifold-enhanced heterogeneous multi-agent continual learning (MHACL) framework that incorporates gradient representation and dual-scale policy optimization to achieve robust performance in dynamic environments with high demands for secure communication. Furthermore, we develop SIM-MHACL (SIMHACL), a low-complexity learning template that embeds phase coordination into a product manifold structure, reducing the exponential search space to linear complexity while maintaining physical feasibility. Simulation results validate that the proposed framework achieves millisecond-level per-iteratio ntraining in SIM-assisted systems, significantly outperforming various baseline schemes, with SIMHACL achieving comparable WSSR to MHACL while reducing computation time by 30\\%.",

    "title": "A new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of multivariate polynomials over finite fields",
    "abstract": "A key property of an algebraic variety is whether it is absolutely irreducible, meaning that it remains irreducible over the algebraic closure of its defining field, and determining absolute irreducibility is important in algebraic geometry and its applications in coding theory, cryptography, and other fields.\n  Among the applications of absolute irreducibility are bounding the number of rational points via the Weil conjectures and establishing exceptional APN and permutation properties of functions over finite fields. In this article, we present a new criterion for the absolute irreducibility of hypersurfaces defined by multivariate polynomials over finite fields. Our criterion does not require testing for irreducibility in the ground or extension fields, assuming that the leading form is square-free. We just require multivariate GCD computations and the square-free property. Since almost all polynomials are known to be square-free, our absolute irreducibility criterion is valid for almost all multivariate polynomials.",

    "abstract": "The paper is devoted to well-posedness analysis and the numerical solution of a family of general elliptic mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities. Various mixed variational equations, mixed variational inequalities and mixed hemivariational inequalities found in the literature are special cases of the mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities. Well-posedness of the mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities and their numerical approximations are studied via the projection iteration technique. Error analysis of the numerical methods is presented. The results are applied to the study of a variational-hemivariational inequality of the Stokes equations for incompressible fluid flows subject to slip conditions of frictional type, both monotone and non-monotone. Optimal order error estimates are derived for the use of some stable finite element space pairs under certain solution regularity assumptions. Numerical results are reported demonstrating the theoretical prediction of convergence orders.",

    "abstract": "Traffic waves, the spatiotemporal propagation of congestion, are a key feature of traffic flow. As Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) systems gain widespread adoption and show promise for improving both efficiency and safety, understanding how these waves evolve under ACC becomes increasingly important. Yet most existing analyses rely on steady-state metrics (e.g., equilibrium spacing) and neglect the ACC control-law parameters, such as feedback gains, that fundamentally shape higher-order traffic dynamics. To overcome this limitation, we embed the ACC control law directly into the momentum equation while retaining mass conservation law. The result is a higher-order macroscopic model whose dynamics are governed by a second-order partial differential equation equivalent to the linear ACC feedback law. Analyzing the flux Jacobian confirms that the system is strictly hyperbolic, thereby preserving anisotropy and ensuring physical consistency. The derivation also shows that traffic wave evolution depends on both the initial state and the ACC control parameters. We analyze wave-propagation characteristics, linear degeneracy, admissible discontinuities, and their connection to ACC string stability, with the corresponding derivations. Numerical experiments confirm that the second-order model yields markedly lower vehicle-pair speed deviations along wave paths than a first-order model subject to the same non-steady disturbances, underscoring both the necessity of a second-order treatment and the soundness of the proposed framework.",

    "abstract": "The present work addresses the Cauchy problem for an abstract nonlinear system of coupled hyperbolic equations associated with the Timoshenko model in a real Hilbert space. Our purpose is to develop and delve into a temporal discretization scheme for approximating a solution to this problem. To this end, we propose a symmetric three-layer semi-discrete time-stepping scheme in which the nonlinear term is evaluated at the temporal midpoint. As a result, at each time step, this approach reduces the original nonlinear problem to a linear one and enables parallel computation of its solution. Convergence is proved, and second-order accuracy with respect to the time-step size is established on a local temporal interval. The proposed scheme is then applied to a spatially one-dimensional nonlinear dynamic Timoshenko beam system, and the results obtained for the abstract nonlinear system are extended to this setting. A Legendre-Galerkin spectral approximation is employed for the spatial discretization. By taking differences of Legendre polynomials within the Galerkin framework, the resulting linear system is sparse and can be efficiently decoupled. The convergence of the method is also investigated. Finally, several numerical experiments on carefully chosen benchmark problems are conducted to validate the proposed approach and to confirm the theoretical findings.",

As consequences, we show that every regular inclusion decomposes into finite direct sums and tensor products of basic building blocks, and that regular inclusions are necessarily of depth two. We further investigate the existence of unitary orthonormal bases in the sense of Pimsner-Popa and prove that, under a natural spectral condition, regularity is equivalent to the existence of a unitary orthonormal basis contained in the normalizer.

Algebraic Combin. 63 (2026) 13] derived a formula for the maximum partial-dual Euler-genus $\\partial\u03b3_M(G)$ of a ribbon graph $G$. Their key finding is that $\\partial\u03b3_M(G)$ can be achieved by a partial dual with respect to the edge set of a spanning quasi-tree. Moreover, they proposed the following problem: Given a ribbon graph $G$, is there a sequence of edges $e_1,e_2,\\dots, e_k$ such that $\u03b3(G^{\\{e_1, e_2,\\dots, e_k\\}})=\\partial\u03b3_M(G)$ and such that the sequence $$\u03b3(G), \u03b3(G^{\\{e_1\\}}), \\dots, \u03b3(G^ {\\{e_1, e_2,\\dots, e_k\\}})$$ rises monotonically (i.e., never decreasing) to $\\partial\u03b3_M(G)$?\n  Delta-matroids are set systems that satisfy the symmetric exchange axiom and serve as a matroidal abstraction of ribbon graphs. In this paper, we first show that the maximum twist width of a set system can be attained by twisting one of its feasible sets, which extends the result of Chen, Gross and Tucker to set systems. Then we solve the delta-matroid version of their problem, thereby providing an affirmative answer to the original problem for ribbon graphs.",

    "title": "Zero-Shot Knowledge Base Resizing for Rate-Adaptive Digital Semantic Communication",
    "abstract": "Digital semantic communication systems, which often leverage the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) framework, are pivotal for future wireless networks. In a VQ-VAE-based semantic communication system, the transmission rate is directly governed by the size of a discrete codebook known as knowledge base (KB). However, the KB size is a fixed hyperparameter, meaning that adapting the rate requires training and storing a separate model for each desired size -- a practice that is too computationally and storage-prohibitive to achieve truly granular rate control. To address this, we introduce a principled, zero-shot KB resizing method that enables on-the-fly rate adaptation without any retraining. Our approach establishes a global importance ranking for all vectors within a single, large parent KB by uncovering its inherent semantic hierarchy. This is achieved via a three-step framework: 1) embedding KB vectors into hyperbolic space to reveal their hierarchical relationships; 2) constructing a master semantic tree using a minimum spanning tree algorithm; 3) enabling instant resizing by iteratively pruning the least important leaf nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our method achieves reconstruction quality nearly identical to that of dedicated KBs trained from scratch, while demanding only a fraction of the computational budget. Moreover, our approach exhibits superior robustness at very low rates, where conventional KBs suffer from catastrophic failure. Our work resolves a fundamental limitation of VQ-VAE-based semantic communication systems, offering a practical and efficient path toward flexible and rate-adaptive semantic communication.",

    "abstract": "Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) requires an understanding of the complex interlinkages that exist among their underlying indicators. While most existing research examines these interconnections at the goal level, policy interventions are typically designed and implemented at the indicator level, where synergies and trade-offs most directly emerge. This study addresses this gap by proposing a network-theoretic framework to assess indicator-level interactions in a systematic and data-driven manner. We introduce two complementary measures, the positive strength and negative strength of an indicator, which jointly capture the balance between synergistic and conflicting interactions within a national SDG indicator network. Based on these measures, indicators are classified as synergy- and trade-off-dominated according to their net systemic interaction structure. To move beyond classification, we further examine the structural drivers of synergy dominance using an explanatory regression framework, focusing on the roles of direct positive interactions and indirect network embeddedness. This analysis shows that indicators classified as synergy-dominated are typically characterized by a high concentration of direct synergies and additional support from indirect pathways through the network, allowing positive effects to extend beyond immediate neighbors. The framework is applied to two national case studies, India and Italy, to illustrate how the classification of indicators varies across development contexts. Overall, the proposed methodology provides a transparent and scalable tool for identifying the structural conditions under which indicator-level synergies emerge, thereby supporting a more nuanced understanding of how development actions can generate reinforcing effects across the SDG system.",

These codes, which arise naturally in problems of geometry, combinatorics, and information theory, continue to challenge researchers with their intricate structure and unresolved questions. Inspired by Polya's heuristic principle of \"vary the problem,\" we extend the classical framework by introducing the notion of noncommutative spherical codes, with particular emphasis on the noncommutative Newton-Gregory kissing number problem. This generalization moves beyond the traditional Euclidean setting into the realm of operator algebras and Hilbert C*-modules, thereby opening new avenues of investigation. A cornerstone in the study of spherical codes is the celebrated Delsarte-Goethals-Seidel-Kabatianskii-Levenshtein linear programming bound, developed over the past half-century. This bound employs Gegenbauer polynomials to establish sharp upper limits on the size of spherical codes, and it has served as a fundamental tool in coding theory and discrete geometry. Remarkably, a recent elegant one-line proof by Pfender [\\textit{J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 2007}] provides a streamlined derivation of a variant of this bound. We demonstrate that Pfender's argument can be extended naturally to the setting of Hilbert C*-modules, thereby enriching the theory with noncommutative analogues.",

Despite this flexibility, the high computational complexity and large parameter footprint of transformer-based decoders present substantial obstacles to practical deployment. To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters. Experiments across diverse codes show that SAP achieves decoding performance comparable to dedicated per-code pruning, while enabling substantial reductions in computational cost and model memory footprint through kernel-level structured pruning.",

In the proof, we relate the generating functions associated with these identities to the Hilbert-Poincar\u00e9 series of suitably constructed graded algebras.",

    "title": "Handling Covariate Mismatch in Federated Linear Prediction",
    "abstract": "Federated learning enables institutions to train predictive models collaboratively without sharing raw data, addressing privacy and regulatory constraints. In the standard horizontal setting, clients hold disjoint cohorts of individuals and collaborate to learn a shared predictor. Most existing methods, however, assume that all clients measure the same features. We study the more realistic setting of covariate mismatch, where each client observes a different subset of features, which typically arises in multicenter collaborations with no prior agreement on data collection. We formalize learning a linear prediction under client-wise MCAR patterns and develop two modular approaches tailored to the dimensional regime and communication budget. In the low-dimensional setting, we propose a plug-in estimator that approximates the oracle linear predictor by aggregating sufficient statistics to estimate the covariance and cross-moment terms. In higher dimensions, we study an impute-then-regress strategy: (i) impute missing covariates using any exchangeability-preserving imputation procedure, and (ii) fit a ridge-regularized linear model on the completed data. We provide asymptotic and finite-sample learning rates for our predictors, explicitly characterizing their behaviour with the global dimension, the client-specific feature partition, and the distribution of samples across sites.",

    "abstract": "Let $ M_0 $ denote either the field structure $ \\mathbb{Q}_p $ of $ p $-adic numbers, or an $o$-minimal expansion of the field structure $ \\mathbb{R} $ of real numbers. We investigate the minimal flows and Ellis groups of definable groups over $ M_0 $ from the perspective of definable topological dynamics. This paper builds on the research initiated in \\cite{BY-APAL} and generalizes the main results thereof in two key ways: First, we extend the scope of these results from reductive algebraic groups to arbitrary definable groups. Second, we generalize the approach from $ p $-adically closed fields to $o$-minimal expansions of real closed fields.\n  Let $G$ be a definable group over $M_0$, and let $B$ be a definably amenable component (see Definition \\ref{def-DAC}) of $G$. In a certain sense, $B$ can be regarded as a ``maximal definably amenable subgroup'' of $G$ (see Fact \\ref{fact-max-DA-subgroup}). The main conclusion of this paper is as follows: For any $M \\succ M_0$, the Ellis group of the universal definable flow of $G$ over $M$ is isomorphic to that of $B$ over $M$. In particular, the Ellis groups of the universal definable flow of $G$ are model-independent, as is the case for $B$ (see \\cite{CS-Definably-Amenable-NIP-Groups}). As a consequence, we conclude that Newelski's Conjecture holds if and only if $G$ is definably amenable when $M_0 = \\mathbb{Q}_p$.",

    "abstract": "Providing performance guarantees is one of the {critical} objectives of {recent and future} communication networks, toward which regulations, {i.e., constraints on key system parameters,} have played an indispensable role. This is the case for large wireless communication networks, where spatial regulations (e.g., constraints on intercell distance) have recently been shown, through a spatial network calculus, to be essential for establishing provable wireless link-level guarantees. In this work, we focus on performance guarantees for {the downlink of} cellular networks where we impose a hardcore (spatial) regulation on base station (BS) locations and evaluate {how BS scheduling (which controls which BSs can transmit at a given time) impacts performance}. Hardcore regulation is the simplest form of spatial regulation that enforces a minimal distance between any pair of transmitters in the network. Within this framework of spatial network calculus, we first provide an upper bound on the power of total interference for a spatially regulated cellular network, and then, identify the regimes where scheduling BSs yields {better} link-level rate guarantees compared to scenarios where base stations are always active. The hexagonal cellular network is analyzed as a special case. The results offer insights into what spatial regulations are needed, when to choose scheduling, and how to potentially reduce the network power consumption {to provide a certain target performance guarantee}.",

In this paper, we introduce a curvature-preserving variant of FIFs built upon a classical cubic spline interpolant. We define a curvature-aware iterated function system (IFS) with parameters optimized via a penalty-based approach to minimize deviation from the curvature of the classical spline. Theoretical conditions for interpolation and curvature approximation are derived. We compare the curvature of the proposed FIF with that of the classical cubic spline and discrete data curvature across multiple examples. Our method achieves both data interpolation and shape fidelity, preserving curvature more accurately than standard splines. The approach has potential applications in geometric modeling, computer graphics, and scientific data interpolation.",

For a given approximate discrete state, we verify existence and local uniqueness of a weak solution in a computable neighbourhood via a Newton--Kantorovich argument based on three certified ingredients: a guaranteed dual-norm residual bound, a computable lower bound for the stability constant of the linearised operator, and a Lipschitz bound for the derivative on the verification ball. The residual bound is obtained by an equilibrated-flux reconstruction exploiting an explicit relation between nonconforming and mixed formulations, yielding $H(\\mathrm{div})$-conforming fluxes without local mixed solves. The stability ingredient follows from a computable coercivity lower bound for the linearisation. An admissible verification radius is selected by a simple bracketing--bisection search, justified for an affine Lipschitz model. Once the verification ball is certified, we derive guaranteed enclosures for quantities of interest using computable variation bounds; an adjoint-based correction, in the spirit of goal-oriented error estimation, tightens these intervals while retaining full rigour. Numerical experiments for semilinear diffusion--reaction models show that the certificates are informative and that the adjoint enhancement substantially reduces enclosure widths.",

While originally derived for nondegenerate critical points, HiSD has demonstrated empirical success in degenerate cases, where the Hessian matrix exhibits zero eigenvalues.

In this paper, utilizing Morse-Bott functions, we present a rigorous analysis of HiSD for computing degenerate saddle points on a critical manifold. We prove the local convergence of the continuous HiSD and establish the linear convergence rate of the discrete HiSD algorithm. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical explanation for the gradient alignment tendency, revealing that the gradient direction asymptotically aligns with a specific Hessian eigenvector. Our analysis also elucidates the flexibility in selecting the index for HiSD in the context of degenerate saddle points. We validate our analytical results through numerical experiments on neural-network loss landscapes and demonstrate that momentum-accelerated variants of HiSD achieve rapid convergence to degenerate saddle points.",

    "title": "Characterizations of inexact proximal operators",
    "abstract": "Proximal operators are now ubiquitous in non-smooth optimization. Since their introduction in the seminal work of Moreau, many papers have shown their effectiveness on a wide variety of problems, culminating in their use to construct convergent deep learning methods. The characterization of these operators for non-convex penalties was completed recently in [Gribonval et al, A characterization of proximity operators, 2020]. In this paper, we propose to follow this line of work by characterizing inexact proximal operators, thus providing an answer to what constitutes a good approximation of these operators. We propose several definitions of approximations and discuss their regularity, approximation power, and their fixed points. Equipped with these characterizations, we investigate the convergence of proximal algorithms in the presence of errors that may be non-summable and/or non-vanishing. In particular, we look at the proximal point algorithm, and at the forward-backward, Peaceman-Rachford and Douglas-Rachford algorithms when we minimize the sum of a weakly convex function (whose proximal operator is approximated) and a strongly convex function.",

The core idea is to replace, without loss of accuracy, the arithmetic average of the flux extrapolations by a general numerical flux evaluated at the edge midpoint, together with a correction term. We show that the proposed flux-correction form preserves third-order accuracy, provided that the general numerical flux is evaluated with the left and right states that are computed exactly for a quadratic function, which can be achieved effectively by the U-MUSCL scheme with \u03ba = 1/2. Numerical results are presented to verify third-order accuracy with the HLLC and LDFSS flux functions on irregular tetrahedral grids.",

    "abstract": "Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular and powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), leveraging neural networks to approximate solutions while embedding PDE constraints, boundary conditions, and interface jump conditions directly into the loss function. However, most existing PINN approaches are based on multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), which may require large network sizes and extensive training to achieve high accuracy, especially for complex interface problems. In this work, we propose a novel PINN architecture based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), which offer greater flexibility in choosing activation functions and can represent functions with fewer parameters. Specifically, we introduce a dual KANs structure that couples two KANs across subdomains and explicitly enforces interface conditions. To further boost training efficiency and convergence, we integrate the RAR-D adaptive sampling strategy to dynamically refine training points. Numerical experiments on the elliptic interface problems yield more uniform error distributions across the computational domain, which demonstrates that our PINN-based KANs achieve superior accuracy with significantly smaller network sizes and faster convergence compared to standard PINNs.",

The key step is a reformulation of multi-phase vortex patch data in terms of a finite family of passively advected scalar marker functions: at each point, the local vorticity is determined by a smooth, pointwise selection rule arising from competition among these markers. The scheme introduces no spatial diffusion or mollification; all regularization originates solely from the marker selection mechanism. As the sharpness parameter $\u03b2\\to\\infty$, we prove uniform convergence of the transported marker functions on finite time intervals. Moreover, under a geometric nondegeneracy condition on the underlying Euler interface network, we establish Hausdorff convergence of the evolving interfacial structures and exponential-in-$\u03b2$ pointwise convergence of the regularized vorticity away from the tie sets to the corresponding sharp multi-phase vortex patch solution. Finally, we show that the loss of pointwise convergence coincides precisely with the onset of geometric degeneracy in the Euler interface dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Differentially private synthetic data enables the sharing and analysis of sensitive datasets while providing rigorous privacy guarantees for individual contributors. A central challenge is to achieve strong utility guarantees for meaningful downstream analysis. Many existing methods ensure uniform accuracy over broad query classes, such as all Lipschitz functions, but this level of generality often leads to suboptimal rates for statistics of practical interest. Since many common data analysis queries exhibit smoothness beyond what worst-case Lipschitz bounds capture, we ask whether exploiting this additional structure can yield improved utility.\n  We study the problem of generating $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$-differentially private synthetic data from a dataset of size $n$ supported on the hypercube $[-1,1]^d$, with utility guarantees uniformly for all smooth queries having bounded derivatives up to order $k$. We propose a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves a minimax error rate of $n^{-\\min \\{1, \\frac{k}{d}\\}}$, up to a $\\log(n)$ factor. This characterization uncovers a phase transition at $k=d$. Our results generalize the Chebyshev moment matching framework of (Musco et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2016) and strictly improve the error rates for $k$-smooth queries established in (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, we establish the first minimax lower bound for the utility of $(\\varepsilon,\u03b4)$-differentially private synthetic data with respect to $k$-smooth queries, extending the Wasserstein lower bound for $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy in (Boedihardjo et al., 2024).",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning have led to AI-based error correction decoders that report empirical performance improvements over traditional belief-propagation (BP) decoding on AWGN channels. While such gains are promising, a fundamental question remains: where do these improvements come from, and what cost is paid to achieve them? In this work, we study this question through the lens of robustness to distributional shifts at the channel output. We evaluate both input-dependent adversarial perturbations (FGM and projected gradient methods under $\\ell_2$ constraints) and universal adversarial perturbations that apply a single norm-bounded shift to all received vectors. Our results show that recent AI decoders, including ECCT and CrossMPT, could suffer significant performance degradation under such perturbations, despite superior nominal performance under i.i.d. AWGN. Moreover, adversarial perturbations transfer relatively strongly between AI decoders but weakly to BP-based decoders, and universal perturbations are substantially more harmful than random perturbations of equal norm. These numerical findings suggest a potential robustness cost and higher sensitivity to channel distribution underlying recent AI decoding gains.",

The main focus is on multidimensional convex limiting techniques designed to constrain antidiffusive element contributions rather than fluxes. We show that the resulting schemes can be interpreted as residual distribution methods. Two kinds of convex limiting can be used to enforce the validity of generalized discrete maximum principles in this context. The first approach has the structure of a localized flux-corrected transport (FCT) algorithm, in which the computation of a low-order predictor is followed by an antidiffusive correction stage. The second option is the use of a monolithic convex limiting (MCL) procedure at the level of spatial semi-discretization. In both cases, inequality constraints are imposed on scalar functions of intermediate states that are required to stay in convex invariant sets.",

From a theoretical perspective, we introduce a gradient-weighted modification of the coupled complex-boundary method (CCBM) incorporating an \\(H^1\\)-type term, and formulate the reconstruction as a regularized optimization problem over bounded admissible coefficients. We establish continuity and differentiability of the forward map, Lipschitz continuity of the modified cost functional, existence of minimizers, stability with respect to noisy data, and convergence under vanishing noise. From a numerical perspective, reconstructions are computed using a Sobolev-gradient descent scheme and evaluated through extensive numerical experiments across a range of noise levels, boundary inputs, and coefficient structures. In the reported tests, for sufficiently large but not excessive $H^1$-weights, the modified CCBM is observed to yield more stable reconstructions and to reduce certain high-frequency artifacts. Across the numerical scenarios considered in this study, the method often demonstrates favorable stability and robustness properties relative to several classical boundary-based formulations, although performance remains problem- and parameter-dependent. A projection-based extension further supports stable recovery of piecewise-constant diffusion coefficients in multi-subregion test cases. Our results indicate that, as long as all subdomains share a portion of the boundary, the proposed CCBM-based Tikhonov regularization approach with a pick-a-point strategy enables stable and reliable reconstruction of diffusion parameters.",

    "title": "Probabilistic function-on-function nonlinear autoregressive model for emulation and reliability analysis of dynamical systems",
    "abstract": "Constructing accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models (or emulators) for predicting dynamical system responses is critical in many engineering domains, yet remains challenging due to the strongly nonlinear and high-dimensional mapping from external excitations and system parameters to system responses. This work introduces a novel Function-on-Function Nonlinear AutoRegressive model with eXogenous inputs (F2NARX), which reformulates the conventional NARX model from a function-on-function regression perspective, inspired by the recently proposed $\\mathcal{F}$-NARX method. The proposed framework substantially improves predictive efficiency while maintaining high accuracy. By combining principal component analysis with Gaussian process regression, F2NARX further enables probabilistic predictions of dynamical responses via the unscented transform in an autoregressive manner. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through case studies of varying complexity. Results show that F2NARX outperforms state-of-the-art NARX model by orders of magnitude in efficiency while achieving higher accuracy in general. Moreover, its probabilistic prediction capabilities facilitate active learning, enabling accurate estimation of first-passage failure probabilities of dynamical systems using only a small number of training time histories.",

    "abstract": "We present an efficient numerical method, inspired by transformation optics, for solving the Poisson equation in complex and arbitrarily shaped geometries. The approach operates by mapping the physical domain to a uniform computational domain through coordinate transformations, which can be applied either to the entire domain or selectively to specific boundaries inside the domain. This flexibility allows both homogeneous (Laplace equation) and inhomogeneous (Poisson equation) problems to be solved efficiently using iterative or fast direct solvers, with only the material parameters and source terms modified according to the transformation. The method is formulated within a finite difference framework, where the modified material properties are computed from the coordinate transformation equations, either analytically or numerically. This enables accurate treatment of arbitrary geometric shapes while retaining the simplicity of a uniform grid solver. Numerical experiments confirm that the method achieves second-order accuracy , and offers a straightforward pathway to integrate fast solvers such as multigrid methods on the uniform computational grid.",

Using techniques of Fourier-Laplace transforms, we first prove the existence of mild solutions for continuous initial data. Using a recently obtained pointwise representation of the fractional material derivative, we then identify a necessary and sufficient condition on the source term that guaranties the solution to remain a probability density for all times (non-negativity and unit mass). Motivated by the need to preserve these probabilistic properties in computations, we construct a finite-volume discretization that is probability conservative by construction. We establish discrete stability and a convergence result for the continuous weak solution as space and time steps tend to zero. Extensive numerical experiments validate the scheme: total mass is conserved, non-negativity is maintained, and the computed solutions reproduce the known analytic representations of the probability density functions associated with the L\u00e9vy walk process. The combined theoretical and numerical framework provides a reliable tool for studying anomalous transport governed by fractional dynamics.",

While the method performs well in computations, a rigorous convergence theory has remained unavailable. We observe that the iteration admits a reformulation as an alternating-projection scheme on Sobolev spaces $H^m$, $m\\ge 0$. At a solution, the G\u00e2teaux differentials of the projection maps are the linear projections onto the corresponding tangent spaces. We prove that these tangent spaces are transverse, and hence the linearization of the alternating-projection map is a contraction by classical Hilbert-space theory for alternating projections. Building on this geometric characterization, we prove linear convergence in $H^2$ of the splitting method on the two-dimensional torus $\\mathbb{T}^2$ for initial data sufficiently close to a solution $u\\in H^4$. To the best of our knowledge, this yields the first rigorous convergence result for this splitting method in the periodic setting and provides a functional-analytic explanation for its observed numerical robustness.",

(2004) introduced least angle regression (LAR) as an algorithm for linear predictions, intended as an alternative to forward selection with connections to penalized regression. However, LAR has remained somewhat of a \"black box,\" where some basic behavioral properties of LAR output are not well understood, including an appropriate termination point for the algorithm. We provide a novel framework for inference with LAR, which also allows LAR to be understood from new perspectives with several newly developed mathematical properties. The LAR algorithm at a data level can viewed as estimating a population counterpart \"path\" that organizes a response mean along regressor variables which are ordered according to a decreasing series of population \"correlation\" parameters; such parameters are shown to have meaningful interpretations for explaining variable contributions whereby zero correlations denote unimportant variables. In the output of LAR, estimates of all non-zero population correlations turn out to have independent normal distributions for use in inference, while estimates of zero-valued population correlations have a certain non-normal joint distribution. These properties help to provide a formal rule for stopping the LAR algorithm. While the standard bootstrap for regression can fail for LAR, a modified bootstrap provides a practical and formally justified tool for interpreting the entrance of variables and quantifying uncertainty in estimation. The LAR inference method is studied through simulation and illustrated with data examples.",

    "abstract": "Classical game theory is a powerful framework to analyze the strategic interactions among rational players. However, in many real-life scenarios, players choose actions based on their inherent natural tendencies rather than deliberate reasoning. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework to study large population games with an alpha-fraction of rational and (1-alpha)-fraction of herding players. We introduce a new notion of equilibrium called alpha-Rational Nash Equilibrium (in short, alpha-RNE) and discuss its interpretations. Some classical equilibria may disappear, and some new ones may emerge, but only for smaller alpha >0. Interestingly, rational players benefit from the presence of herding and may even achieve utility exceeding the socially optimum. Even more strikingly, in some cases, the herding players also benefit, attaining utility close to the social optimum.\n  We further study the effect of the herding fraction on system performance using measures such as the Price of Anarchy (PoA). In transportation networks, a well-known paradox first studied by Pigou and later by Braess typically arises from rational decision-making: adding an extra link can reduce overall efficiency. Our analysis leads to a different conclusion. When a substantial fraction of users exhibit herding behavior, introducing a new link can increase efficiency, provided herding choices can be suitably influenced. The gains are larger when the herding fraction is higher and/or congestion is lower. By contrast, when herding decisions cannot be influenced, the added link may become detrimental. We also study a bandwidth sharing game in which herding tendencies improve system efficiency. Finally, we discuss the mechanism or influence design in the presence of herding, highlighting both opportunities and risks.",

Utilizing a unified information-geometric framework, we introduce (Kalman)-Wasserstein-based KL analogues by replacing the Fisher-Rao geometry in the dynamical formulation of the KL with transport-based geometries, and we derive closed-form values for common distribution families. These divergences remain finite under support mismatch and yield a geometric interpretation of regularization heuristics used in Kalman ensemble methods. We demonstrate the utility of these divergences in KL-regularized optimal control. In the fully tractable setting of linear time-invariant systems with Gaussian process noise, the classical KL reduces to a quadratic control penalty that becomes singular as process noise vanishes. Our variants remove this singularity, yielding well-posed problems. On a double integrator and a cart-pole example, the resulting controls outperform KL-based regularization.",

For positive admissible-level string functions for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$, very little is known. Here we apply the notion of quasi-periodicity to a generalized Euler identity of Schilling and Warnaar for the affine Kac--Moody algebra $A_{1}^{(1)}$. For integral-level string functions the classical periodicity reduces the infinite sum of string functions in the generalized Euler identity to a finite sum of string functions with theta function coefficients. For admissible-level, we similarly reduce to an analogous finite sum of string functions, but we also gain an additional finite sum of the form \\begin{equation*} \\sum_{i}\u03a6_{i}(q)\u03a8_{i}(q), \\end{equation*} where the $\u03a6_i(q)$'s are modular and depend only on the spin and the $\u03a8_{i}(q)$'s are (mixed) mock modular Hecke-type double-sums and depend only on the quantum number. For levels $1/2$, $1/3$, and $2/3$, we shall also see that the $\u03a8_{i}(q)$'s give us families of mock theta conjecture-like identities for symmetric Hecke-type double-sums. Our work here focuses on evaluating the $\u03a8_{i}(q)$'s, and our expressions utilize Ramanujan's second-order mock theta function $\u03bc_2(q)$ and third-order mock theta functions $f_{3}(q)$, $\u03c9_3(q)$, $\u03c8_{3}(q)$, and $\u03c7_3(q)$.",

Our approach is based on a sectional transfer operator acting on families of probability measures along the fibres. The operator allows to describe invariant measures of the skew-product in terms of sample measures over the base dynamics, regardless of invertibility or non-invertibility of the base map. Under general assumptions, we establish existence and uniqueness of invariant sample measures and prove their differentiability, with respect to system parameters, in suitable topologies. As an application we obtain linear response for Bernoulli convolutions, which are of prime importance in the study of number theoretic problems and fractals. Another application of our results yields linear response for physical measures of solenoidal attractors with intermittency, an example of a hyperbolic system which cannot be handled by traditional transfer operator techniques.",

    "abstract": "We study federated learning (FL) over wireless fading channels where multiple devices simultaneously send their model updates. We propose an efficient \\emph{age-aware edge-blind over-the-air FL} approach that does not require channel state information (CSI) at the devices. Instead, the parameter server (PS) uses multiple antennas and applies maximum-ratio combining (MRC) based on its estimated sum of the channel gains to detect the parameter updates. A key challenge is that the number of orthogonal subcarriers is limited; thus, transmitting many parameters requires multiple Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) symbols, which increases latency. To address this, the PS selects only a small subset of model coordinates each round using \\emph{AgeTop-\\(k\\)}, which first picks the largest-magnitude entries and then chooses the \\(k\\) coordinates with the longest waiting times since they were last selected. This ensures that all selected parameters fit into a single OFDM symbol, reducing latency. We provide a convergence bound that highlights the advantages of using a higher number of antenna array elements and demonstrates a key trade-off: increasing \\(k\\) decreases compression error at the cost of increasing the effect of channel noise. Experimental results show that (i) more PS antennas greatly improve accuracy and convergence speed; (ii) AgeTop-\\(k\\) outperforms random selection under relatively good channel conditions; and (iii) the optimum \\(k\\) depends on the channel, with smaller \\(k\\) being better in noisy settings.",

    "abstract": "We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system consisting of a central server, $N$ task-specific networks of machines, and multiple users. Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes.",

The limit system preserves the essential physical mechanisms of the original model, while exhibiting a reduced, effectively two-and-a-half-dimensional structure. This simplified framework allows for a rigorous analytical study of the data assimilation process while maintaining a direct physical connection to the full compressible model. We establish well posedness of global-in-time solutions and a compact trajectory attractor, followed by the stability and convergence results for the nudging scheme applied to the limiting system. Finally, we demonstrate how these results can be combined with a relative entropy argument to extend the assimilation framework to the full three-dimensional compressible setting, thereby establishing a rigorous connection between the reduced and physically complete models.",

On the other hand, extreme value theory provides the theoretical foundation for constructing asymptotically justified tests. We combine this theory with Kullback-Leibler divergence, a fundamental concept in information theory and statistics, to propose a test for equality of extremal dependence structures in practically relevant directions. Under suitable assumptions, we derive the limiting distributions of the proposed statistic under null and alternative hypotheses. Importantly, our test is fast to compute and easy to interpret by practitioners, making it attractive in applications. Simulations provide evidence of the power of our test. In a case study, we apply our method to show the strong impact of seasons on the strength of dependence between different aggregation periods (daily versus hourly) of heavy rainfall in France.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of the new multi-user linearly-separable distributed computing framework, has recently revealed how a parallel treatment of users can yield large parallelization gains with relatively low computation and communication costs. These gains stem from a new approach that converts the computing problem into a sparse matrix factorization problem; a matrix $F$ that describes the users' requests, is decomposed as \\(F = DE\\), where a \\(\u03b3\\)-sparse \\(E\\) defines the task allocation across $N$ servers, and a \\(\u03b4\\)-sparse \\(D\\) defines the connectivity between \\(N\\) servers and \\(K\\) users as well as the decoding process. While this approach provides near-optimal performance, its linear nature has raised data secrecy concerns.\n  We here adopt an information-theoretic secrecy framework, seeking guarantees that each user can learn nothing more than its own requested function. In this context, our main result provides two necessary and sufficient secrecy criteria; (i) for each user \\(k\\) who observes $\u03b1_k$ server responses, the common randomness visible to that user must span a subspace of dimension exactly $\u03b1_k-1$,\n  and (ii) for each user, removing from \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) the columns corresponding to the servers it observes must leave a matrix of rank at least \\(K-1\\). With these conditions in place, we design a general scheme -- that applies to finite and non-finite fields alike -- which is based on appending to \\(\\mathbf{E}\\) a basis of \\(\\mathrm{Null}(\\mathbf{D})\\) and by carefully injecting shared randomness. In many cases, this entails no additional costs. The scheme, while maintaining performance, guarantees perfect information-theoretic secrecy in the case of finite fields, while in the real case, the conditions yield an explicit mutual-information bound that can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the variance of Gaussian common randomness.",

By the Batchelor-Gawedzki-type theorem (Kotov--Salnikov), every $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifold over base $M$ is noncanonically isomorphic to one associated with its canonical $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded bundle (Batchelor-Gawedzki bundle). In finite dimensions, this is the formal neighborhood of the zero section with the induced homogeneity structure. Kotov-Salnikov's graded Borel lemma extends weight-$k$ functions from the formal neighborhood to smooth ones of the same weight. Here, this generalizes to a Borel--Whitney theorem: homogeneity morphisms of formal neighborhoods lift to smooth homogeneity maps between Batchelor-Gawedzki bundles. Categorically, let $\\mathsf{B}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ be the category of finite-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded vector bundles with homogeneity morphisms, and $\\mathsf{Man}_{\\mathbb{Z}}$ the category of finite-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}$-graded manifolds.

    "abstract": "A major barrier to wide adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is the absence of reliable and equitable charging infrastructure. Poorly located charging stations create coverage gaps and slow down EV adoption, especially in underserved communities. This paper proposes a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model for the optimal deployment of Fixed and Mobile Charging Stations (FCSs and MCSs) across multiple zones and periods. Initially, a finite dominating set of candidate locations is identified using the Edge Scanning Algorithm for a Single Refueling Station (ESS), an exact continuous-location method. We modify the ESS algorithm to incorporate existing public charging stations, thereby avoiding redundant coverage. In the first stage of our model, FCSs are allocated based on long-term traffic patterns, budgetary constraints, and socioeconomic factors to ensure stable baseline coverage. The second stage dynamically assigns MCSs in response to short-term demand fluctuations and uncertainties, aiming to minimize relocation costs while maximizing coverage. We use a scenario-based framework to capture demand variability. Numerical experiments on realistic networks demonstrate the model's capacity to enhance system resilience and reduce unmet demand. These findings offer practical insights for planners and policymakers seeking to develop accessible and demand-responsive EV charging infrastructure.",

    "title": "Decidability of Interpretability",
    "abstract": "The Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture asserts a P vs. NP-complete dichotomy for the computational complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) of first-order reducts of finitely bounded homogeneous structures. Prominently, two structures in the scope of the conjecture have log-space equivalent CSPs if they are pp-bi-interpretable, or equivalently, if their polymorphism clones are topologically isomorphic. The latter gives rise to the algebraic approach which regards structures with topologically isomorphic polymorphism clones as equivalent and seeks to identify structural reasons for hardness or tractability in topological clones. We establish that the equivalence relation of pp-bi-interpretability underlying this approach is reasonable: On the one hand, we show that it is decidable under mild conditions on the templates; this improves a theorem of Bodirsky, Pinsker and Tsankov (LICS'11) on decidability of equality of polymorphism clones. On the other hand, we show that within the much larger class of transitive $\u03c9$-categorical structures without algebraicity, the equivalence relation is of lowest possible complexity in terms of descriptive set theory: namely, it is smooth, i.e., Borel-reduces to equality on the real numbers. On our way to showing the first result, we establish that the model-complete core of a structure that has a finitely bounded Ramsey expansion (which might include all structures of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture) is computable, thereby providing a constructive alternative to previous non-constructive proofs of its existence.",

    "abstract": "The power spectrum of the Brownian motion of probe microparticles with mass m and radius R immersed in a viscoelastic material reveals valuable information about repetitive patterns and correlation structures that manifest in the frequency domain. In this paper, we employ a viscous viscoelastic correspondence principle for Brownian motion and we show that the power spectrum of Brownian motion in any linear, isotropic viscoelastic material is proportional to the real part of the complex dynamic fluidity of a linear rheological network that is a parallel connection of the linear viscoelastic material within which the Brownian particles are immersed and an inerter, with distributed intrance with mass mR. The synthesis of this rheological analogue simplifies appreciably the calculation of the power spectrum for Brownian motion within viscoelastic materials such as Maxwell fluids, Jeffreys fluids, subdiffusive materials, or in dense viscous fluids that give rise to hydrodynamic memory.",

We focus on the characterization in terms of the existence of a degree 3 morphism to a line, and discuss relations to possible embeddings into $\\mathbb R^2$ reflecting an embedding into a Hirzebruch surface. Our results can be divided into three parts: for tropical curves of low genus 3 and 4, we discuss the relation between a trigonal morphism and an embedding dual to the polygon of a Hirzebruch surface, building on works on embeddings of hyperelliptic tropical curves and curves of low genus. We compare obstructions for embeddings with obstructions for the existence of a degree 3 morphism to a line. Finally, we showcase examples where a non-smooth embedding can be unfolded to reflect certain features of a degree 3 morphism to a line.",

    "abstract": "Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) are extensions to the well-known Shallow Water Equations (SWE) for the efficient modeling and numerical simulation of free-surface flows. While the SWE typically assume a depth-averaged vertical velocity profile, the SWME allow for vertical variations of the velocity profile. The SWME therefore assume a polynomial profile and then derive additional evolution equations for the polynomial coefficients via higher order depth integration. In this work, we perform a new systematic derivation of the energy equation for a specific variant of the SWME, called the Shallow Water Linearized Moment Equations (SWLME). The derivation is based on the standard SWE energy equation derivation and includes the skew-symmetric formulation of the model. The new systematic derivation is beneficial for the extension to other SWME variants and their numerical solution.",
