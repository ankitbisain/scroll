    "title": "Learning-Augmented Perfectly Secure Collaborative Matrix Multiplication",
    "abstract": "This paper presents a perfectly secure matrix multiplication (PSMM) protocol for multiparty computation (MPC) of $\\mathrm{A}^{\\top}\\mathrm{B}$ over finite fields. The proposed scheme guarantees correctness and information-theoretic privacy against threshold-bounded, semi-honest colluding agents, under explicit local storage constraints. Our scheme encodes submatrices as evaluations of sparse masking polynomials and combines coefficient alignment with Beaver-style randomness to ensure perfect secrecy. We demonstrate that any colluding set of parties below the security threshold observes uniformly random shares, and that the recovery threshold is optimal, matching existing information-theoretic limits. Building on this framework, we introduce a learning-augmented extension that integrates tensor-decomposition-based local block multiplication, capturing both classical and learned low-rank methods. We demonstrate that the proposed learning-based PSMM preserves privacy and recovery guarantees for MPC, while providing scalable computational efficiency gains (up to $80\\%$) as the matrix dimensions grow.",

Given finite subsets $A$ and $B$ of an abelian group $G$, a matching is a bijection $f:A\\to B$ such that $af(a)\\notin A$ for all $a\\in A$, a definition motivated by the study of canonical forms for symmetric tensors. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a partial matching with any prescribed defect, and then describe the minimal unavoidable defect for a pair $(A,B)$. We also define and examine a defective version of Chowla sets in the matching context. We prove a structure theorem identifying obstructions to the existence of partial matchings with small defect. Finally, within the deltoid setup, we establish max-min results on the partitioning of $A$ and $B$ into left- and right-admissible sets.

Nahon reduces potential global minimizers in dimension two to four possible categories. Our work shows that three of these categories persist in any dimension and are in fact global minimizers.\n  Moreover, we show that minimizers of the two-sided biharmonic Alt-Caffarelli problem do in general not satisfy a partial differential equation, not even with a signed measure as right-hand-side.

We study the scattering resonances of the associated self-adjoint Hamiltonian, defined as the poles of the meromorphic continuation of its resolvent.\n  We obtain a sharp asymptotic description of resonances near the real axis as $\u03c4\\to0$. Near each nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the interior Lam\u00e9 operator there is a cluster of resonances lying just below it in the complex plane; in this wavelength-scale regime the imaginary parts are of order $\u03c4$ with non-vanishing leading coefficients. In addition, near zero (a subwavelength regime), we identify resonances with real parts of order $\\sqrt\u03c4$ and prove a lifetime dichotomy: their imaginary parts are of order $\u03c4$ generically, but of order $\u03c4^2$ for an explicit admissible set $\\mathcal E$. This yields a classification of long-lived elastic resonances in the high-contrast limit.\n  We also establish resolvent asymptotics for both fixed-size resonators and microresonators. We derive explicit expansions with a finite-rank leading term and quantitative remainder bounds, valid near both wavelength-scale and subwavelength resonances. For microresonators, at the wavelength scale the dominant contribution is an anisotropic elastic point scatterer. Near the zero eigenvalue, the leading-order behaviour is of monopole or dipole type, and we give a rigorous criterion distinguishing the two cases.",

    "abstract": "We present a fast, unconditionally energy-stable numerical scheme for simulating vesicle deformation under osmotic pressure using a phase-field approach. The model couples an Allen-Cahn equation for the biomembrane interface with a variable-mobility Cahn-Hilliard equation governing mass exchange across the membrane. Classical approaches, including nonlinear multigrid and Multiple Scalar Auxiliary Variable (MSAV) methods, require iterative solution of variable-coefficient systems at each time step, resulting in substantial computational cost. We introduce a constant-coefficient MSAV (CC-MSAV) scheme that incorporates stabilization directly into the Cahn-Hilliard evolution equation rather than the chemical potential. This reformulation yields fully decoupled constant-coefficient elliptic problems solvable via fast discrete cosine transform (DCT), eliminating iterative solvers entirely. The method achieves O(N^2 log N) complexity per time step while preserving unconditional energy stability and discrete mass conservation. Numerical experiments verify second-order temporal and spatial accuracy, mass conservation to relative errors below 5 x 10^-11, and close agreement with nonlinear multigrid benchmarks. On grids with N >= 2048, CC-MSAV achieves 6-15x overall speedup compared to classical MSAV with optimized preconditioning, while the dominant Cahn-Hilliard subsystem is accelerated by up to two orders of magnitude. These efficiency gains, achieved without sacrificing accuracy, make CC-MSAV particularly well suited for large-scale simulations of vesicle dynamics.",

The client wants to retrieve one desired file, while keeping the index of the desired file private from each server via a query-response protocol. We seek PIR protocols that have (a) high rate, which is the ratio of the file-size to the total download cost, and (b) low subpacketization, which acts as a constraint on the size of the files for executing the protocol. We report two new schemes which have unit-subpacketization (which is minimal): (i) for a special class of graphs known as star graphs, and (ii) for general graphs. Our star-graph scheme has a better rate than previously known schemes with low subpacketization for general star graphs. Our scheme for general graphs uses a decomposition of the graph via independent sets. This scheme achieves a rate lower than prior schemes for the complete graph, however it can achieve higher rates than known for some specific graph classes. An extension of our scheme to the case of multigraphs achieves a higher rate than previous schemes for the complete multi-graph.",

Using a novel comparison technique based on convex hypersurfaces inspired by Choi, G\u00e1lvez, and Lozano, we overcome the absence of totally geodesic foliations, which are instrumental in the hyperbolic space. Our results highlight the interplay between curvature, the spectrum of the Laplacian, and the geometry of the asymptotic boundary.",

It is the only known nontrivial (discrete or continuous-time) memoryless channel with a closed-form formula for its optimal non-asymptotic error probability, making it the simplest channel in this sense. A potential application is optical communication with a tunable band rejection filter. Due to its simplicity, we may use it as a basic currency of information that is infinitely divisible, as an alternative to bits which are not infinitely divisible.

Beyond localization, we establish a sharp exclusion principle for unstable equilibria: strict local maxima and saddle points of the Lyapunov function are shown to carry zero mass in limiting invariant measures under explicit and verifiable non-degeneracy conditions.\n  Our analysis identifies a local mechanism driven by Lyapunov geometry and persistent variance, showing that equilibrium selection in constant-step dynamics is governed by typical fluctuations rather than rare events.

To enhance accuracy, we employ interface-focused collocation resampling. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions show that the framework achieves accurate reconstructions of both temperature fields and interface dynamics, highlighting the potential of KANs as a compact and efficient alternative for moving boundary PDEs. First, we validate the model with semi-infinite analytical solutions. Subsequently, the model is extended to 2D using a level-set based formulation for interface propagation, which is solved within the KAN framework. This work demonstrates that KANs are capable of solving complex moving boundary problems without the need for measurement data.",

We introduce a global Gaussian $L^p$--norm for slice functions on $\\mathbb H$ and prove that the resulting global quaternionic Fock space $F_\u03b1^p$ coincides with the slice-defined Fock space $\\mathfrak F_\u03b1^p$, with equivalent norms. In particular, $F_\u03b1^2$ becomes a right quaternionic reproducing kernel Hilbert space with an explicit reproducing kernel, yielding a slice-independent Fock projection onto $F_\u03b1^2$.\n  (ii) Kernel-induced integral operators and Fock--Carleson measures. We investigate kernel-induced integral operators and characterize quaternionic Fock--Carleson measures. These embedding theorems provide the measure-theoretic basis that underlies boundedness and compactness criteria for operators on quaternionic Fock spaces.\n  (iii)Berezin transforms and Toeplitz operators. We define the Berezin transform for slice functions and prove its fundamental properties, including semigroup behavior and fixed-point features. Building on the slice-independent projection and the slice product, we introduce Toeplitz operators with slice-function symbols and with measure symbols, and develop their basic algebraic properties. We then obtain complete boundedness and compactness characterizations for Toeplitz operators with two natural symbol classes: positive measures and slice $\\mathrm{BMO}^1$ symbols, expressed in terms of Berezin-type transforms and slice/symmetric averaging quantities.",

With these enhanced structures, we design a versatile parameter-free and nonmonotone line-search framework that does not require evaluating the inner maximization. Under mild conditions, global convergence rates can be obtained, and, with KL property, full sequence convergence with asymptotic rates is also established. In particular, we show our framework is compatible with the gradient descent-ascent (GDA) algorithm.

We first derive commutator estimates in these spaces, dispensing with the conventional divergence-free condition, via the Bony paraproduct decomposition and vector-valued maximal function inequalities. Building on these estimates and combining the method of characteristics with a compactness argument, we then obtain the new a priori estimates and prove local well-posedness for the transport equation in Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. The resulting theory is applicable to a wide range of evolution equations, including models for incompressible and compressible ideal fluid flows, shallow water waves, among others. As an illustration, we consider the incompressible ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system. Employing the general transport theory developed here yields a complete local well-posedness result in the sense of Hadamard, covering both sub-critical and critical regularity regimes, and provides corresponding blow-up criteria for the ideal MHD equations in Triebel-Lizorkin spaces.

In this study, we investigate the associated exit problem and propose a method to compute the exit time probability, which quantifies the likelihood that a trajectory starting from an initial condition exits a bounded region in phase space within a given time. This estimation plays a key role in understanding anomalous diffusion behavior. The proposed method approximates the \u03b1-stable process by combining a Brownian motion with a compound Poisson process. The exit time probability is then modeled using a framework based on partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). The Feynman-Kac formula provides a probabilistic representation of the solution, involving conditional expectations over stochastic differential equations. These expectations are computed via tailored quadrature rules and interpolation techniques. The proposed method achieves first-order convergence in time and offers significant computational advantages over standard Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches. In particular, it avoids assembling and solving large dense linear systems, resulting in improved efficiency. We demonstrate the method's accuracy and performance through two numerical examples, highlighting its applicability to physical transport problems.",

    "title": "When an Approximate Model Suffices for Optimal Control",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop an optimal control framework for dynamical systems when only an approximate model of the underlying plant is available. We consider a setting in which the control strategy is synthesized using a model-based optimal control problem that includes a penalty term capturing deviation from the plant trajectory, while the same control input is applied to both the model and the actual system. For a general class of optimal control problems, we establish conditions under which the control minimizing the model-based Hamiltonian coincides with the plant-optimal control, despite mismatch between the model and the true dynamics. We further specialize these results to problems with quadratic control effort, where explicit and easily verifiable sufficient conditions guarantee equivalence and uniqueness of the resulting optimal control. These results show that accurate control synthesis does not require an exact model of the underlying system, but rather alignment of the optimality conditions that govern control selection. From a learning perspective, this suggests that data-driven efforts can focus on identifying regimes in which model-based and plant-based Hamiltonian minimizers coincide, thereby providing a theoretical basis for robust model-based decision making and the effective use of digital twins under modeling error. We provide examples to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate equivalence of the resulting control trajectories even in the presence of significant model mismatch.",

We describe four infinite families of Kostant cuspidal involutions, including a complete classification of Kostant cuspidal fully commutative involutions.

The resulting system consists of four differential equations describing the evolution of susceptible and infected prey and predator populations, incorporating ecological interactions, disease transmission, and spatial dispersal. To learn the underlying dynamics directly from data, we employ several data-driven modeling frameworks: Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Ordinary Differential Equations (KANODEs), and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). Numerical experiments based on synthetic data are conducted to investigate the learning ability of these models in capturing the epidemic and ecological behavior.

We then formulate controllability scoring problems on an infinite time horizon. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the resulting VCS and AECS are unique and that the finite-horizon scores converge to them. We further show that VCS and AECS can differ markedly in this limit, because VCS enforces controllability of the full system, whereas AECS accounts only for the stable modes.

    "abstract": "Optimization is central to both modern machine learning (ML) and scientific machine learning (SciML), yet the structure of the underlying optimization problems differs substantially across these domains. Classical ML typically relies on stochastic, sample-separable objectives that favor first-order and adaptive gradient methods. In contrast, SciML often involves physics-informed or operator-constrained formulations in which differential operators induce global coupling, stiffness, and strong anisotropy in the loss landscape. As a result, optimization behavior in SciML is governed by the spectral properties of the underlying physical models rather than by data statistics, frequently limiting the effectiveness of standard stochastic methods and motivating deterministic or curvature-aware approaches. This document provides a unified introduction to optimization methods in ML and SciML, emphasizing how problem structure shapes algorithmic choices. We review first- and second-order optimization techniques in both deterministic and stochastic settings, discuss their adaptation to physics-constrained and data-driven SciML models, and illustrate practical strategies through tutorial examples, while highlighting open research directions at the interface of scientific computing and scientific machine learning.",

However, the direction in which the nonlinear effects act differs: one acts along the isothermal surface, while the other acts along the temperature gradient in a specified direction. The main assertion quantifies this difference through the large-time behavior of their solutions. In particular, the nonlinear distortions in the asymptotic profiles of both equations are compared. In this context, the spatial symmetry of the first approximation plays a crucial role, but the solutions require no symmetry.",

R\u00e1th, Sz\u0151ke and Warnke identified the local weak limit of the RDCP and gave an alternative characterization of the critical time in terms of the principal eigenvalue of the branching operator of the multi-type branching process that arises as the local limit object.\n  In the current paper we use this spectral characterization to study the critical time of the RDCP in the almost 2-regular case, i.e., when the degree constraint of most of the vertices is equal to 2. In this case the giant component emerges quite late, and our main result provides the precise asymptotics of the critical time as the model approaches 2-regularity. Interestingly, our formula asymptotically matches the well-known Molloy-Reed formula, despite the fact that Molloy, Surya and Warnke proved that the final graph of the RDCP is not contiguous to the configuration model with the same degree sequence.",

In this paper, we introduce a modification of the randomized Arnoldi process that restores similarity with the Hessenberg matrix generated by the standard Arnoldi process. This is accomplished by enforcing orthogonality between the last Arnoldi vector and the previously generated subspace, which requires solving only one additional least-squares problem. When applied to eigenvalue problems and matrix function evaluations, the modified randomized Arnoldi process produces approximations that are identical to those obtained with the standard Arnoldi process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach is as fast as the randomized Arnoldi process and as robust as the standard Arnoldi process.",

At criticality, we exploit network symmetries to analyze the onset of collective oscillations via Hopf bifurcation theory, demonstrating the emergence of synchronized periodic states in ring-symmetric networks.

We rigorously prove that the two new schemes have second-order convergence rate. The proposed splitting methods show clear advantages for equations whose generator consists of a linear part plus a nonlinear part, as they reduce the number of iterations required for solving implicit schemes, thereby decreasing computational cost while maintaining second-order convergence. Two numerical examples are provided, including the backward stochastic Riccati equation arising in mean-variance hedging.

For locally Lipschitz semialgebraic objectives, we develop a convergence framework under the assumption that continuous-time subgradient trajectories are bounded: for sufficiently small step sizes of order \\(1/k\\), any subgradient sequence remains bounded and converges to a critical point. We verify this trajectory boundedness assumption for the robust objectives by adapting and extending existing trajectory analyses, requiring only a mild nondegeneracy condition in the matrix sensing case.

    "abstract": "We present a unified operator-theoretic formulation of stochastic calculus based on two principles: fluctuations factor through differentiation, predictable projection, and integration, and the appropriate stochastic derivative is the Hilbert adjoint of the stochastic integral on the energy space of the driving process. On an isonormal Gaussian space we recover the identity (Id - E)F = delta Pi D F, where D is the Malliavin derivative, Pi is predictable projection, and delta is the divergence operator. Motivated by this factorization, we define for a square-integrable process X admitting a closed stochastic integral an operator-covariant derivative on L2(Omega) via Riesz representation. This yields a canonical Clark-Ocone representation that unifies Malliavin, Volterra-Malliavin, and functional Ito derivatives and clarifies the operator geometry underlying stochastic calculus.",

    "abstract": "Quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC codes with large girths play a crucial role in several research and application fields, including channel coding, compressed sensing and distributed storage systems. A major challenge in respect of the code construction is how to obtain such codes with the shortest possible length (or equivalently, the smallest possible circulant size) using algebraic methods instead of search methods. The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, these new constructions can also offer circulant sizes asymptotically about 25% smaller than the novel bounds.",

This paper investigates two open problems in spectral graph theory related to the booksize of graphs.\n  First, we prove that for any positive integer $r$ and any $ B_{r+1} $-free graph $ G $ with $ m \\geq (9r)^2 $ edges, the spectral radius satisfies $ \u03c1(G) \\leq \\sqrt{m} $. Equality holds if and only if $ G $ is a complete bipartite graph. This result improves the lower bound on the booksize of Nosal graphs (i.e., graphs with $ \u03c1(G) > \\sqrt{m} $) from the previously established $ \\mathrm{bk}(G) > \\frac{1}{144}\\sqrt{m} $ to $ \\mathrm{bk}(G) > \\frac{1}{9}\\sqrt{m} $, presenting a significant advancement in the booksize conjecture proposed Li, Liu, and Zhang.\n  Second, we show that for any positive integer $r$ and any non-bipartite $ B_{r+1} $-free graph $ G $ with $ m \\geq (240r)^2 $ edges, the spectral radius $\u03c1$ satisfies $\u03c1^2<m-1+\\frac{2}{\u03c1-1}$, unless $G$ is isomorphic to $S^+_{m,s}$ for some $s\\in\\{1,\\ldots,r\\}$. This resolves Liu and Miao's conjecture and further reveals an interesting phenomenon: even with a weaker spectral condition, $\u03c1^2\\geq m-1+\\frac2{\u03c1-1}$, we can still derive the supersaturation of the booksize for non-bipartite graphs.",

We analyze the structure of optimal SEFCC constructions through their associated codeword distance matrices and identify distinct FCC classes based on this structure. We then examine the impact of these structural differences on error performance by evaluating representative FCCs over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using both soft-decision and hard-decision decoding. The results show that FCCs with different distance-matrix structures can exhibit markedly different Data BER and function error behavior, and that the influence of code structure depends strongly on the decoding strategy.",

We establish tuning criteria above which the Lasso becomes inadmissible under mean squared prediction error.

Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.",

In this work, we study the problem of efficient reconstruction when each of the $K$ outputs is corrupted by a $q$-ary discrete memoryless symmetric (DMS) substitution channel with substitution probability $p$. Focusing on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, we adapt the Koetter-Vardy soft-decision decoding algorithm to obtain an efficient reconstruction algorithm. For sufficiently large blocklength and alphabet size, we derive an explicit rate threshold, depending only on $(p, K)$, such that the transmitted codeword can be reconstructed with arbitrarily small probability of error whenever the code rate $R$ lies below this threshold.",

    "abstract": "We present a methodology that extends invariant manifold theory to a class of autonomous piecewise linear systems with nonsmoothness at the equilibrium, providing a framework for model order reduction in mechanical structures with compliant contact laws. The key idea is to make the absence of a local linearization around the equilibrium tractable by leveraging the positive homogeneity property. This property simplifies the invariance equations defining the geometry of the invariant cones, from a set of partial differential equations to a system of ordinary differential equations, enabling their effective solution. We introduce two techniques to compute these invariant cones. First, an intuitive graph-style parametrization is proposed that utilizes Fourier expansions and Chebyshev polynomials to derive explicit reduced-order models in closed form. Second, an arc-length parametrization is introduced to robustly compute invariant cones with complex folding geometries, which are intractable with a standard graph-style technique. The approach is demonstrated on mechanical oscillators with unilateral visco-elastic supports, showcasing its applicability for systems with both continuous (unilateral elastic) and discontinuous (unilateral visco-elastic) unilateral force laws.",

In the case $p<q$, we show that the situation is more delicate.

    "abstract": "This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.",

Their technique relies on the Guruswami--Sudan list decoding algorithm for RS codes, which is guaranteed to work in the Johnson bound regime.\n  Folded Reed--Solomon (FRS) codes are known to achieve the optimal list decoding radius $\u03b4$, a regime known as capacity. Moreover, a rich line of list decoding algorithms was developed for FRS codes. It is then natural to ask if FRS codes can be shown to exhibit an analogous $(\u03b4,\\varepsilon)$-proximity gap, but up to the so-called optimal capacity regime. We answer this question in the affirmative (and the framework naturally applies more generally to suitable subspace-design codes).\n  An additional motivation to understand proximity gaps for FRS codes is the recent results [BCDZ'25] showing that they exhibit properties similar to random linear codes, which were previously shown to be related to properties of RS codes with random evaluation points in [LMS'25], as well as codes over constant-size alphabet based on AEL [JS'25].",

An interesting feature of the proposed algorithm is its ability to select the better step size between the self-adaptive and Armijo-like options at each iteration step.

For instance, we consider time dependent triggering probabilities. We identify regularity conditions on these probabilities that classify the schemes into those where the number of colors in the urn remains almost surely finite or increases to infinity and conditions that tell us whether all the existing colors are observed infinitely often or not. We determine the rank curve, too. In view of the broad generality of the trigger probabilities, a spectrum of limit distributions appears, from central limit theorems to Poisson approximation, to power-laws, revealing connections to Heap's exponent and Zipf's law. A combinatorial approach to the Simon urn is presented to indicate the possibility of such exact analysis, which is important for short-term predictions. Extensive simulations on real datasets (from Amazon sales) as well as computer-generated data clearly indicate that the asymptotic and exact theory developed agrees with practice.",

We find that in the one-shot regime, utilizing disjoint codebooks at each decoder yields a codebook diversity gain, distinct from the channel diversity gain that may be expected when several decoders observe independent realizations of the channel's output but share the same codebook. Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity.

This enables us to mark at random a typical point in the tree at which the decoration is $x$. We identify the law of the decoration along the branch from the root to this tagged point in terms of a remarkable (positive) self-similar Markov process. We also show that after a proper normalization, $L(x,dt)$ converges as $x\\to 0+$ to the harmonic measure $\u03bc$ on the tree. Finally, we point out that using a local time measure instead of the usual length measure $\u03bb$ to compute distances on the tree turn the latter into a continuous branching tree.

The criteria enable a convenient graphic tool for analyzing the passivization, the associated frequency bands, the maximum achievable passivity index, and the waterbed effect between them. Additionally, the tool can be encoded into classical tools such as the Nyquist plot, the Nichols plot, and the generalized KYP lemma to aid control design. Finally, we demonstrate its application in passivity-based power system stability analysis and discuss its implications for electrical engineers regarding device controller design trade-offs.",

When the deforming parameter of A (respectively A') ranges from -k to k+j (respectively, from -k' to k'+j), with k different from k' and j at least 3, this allows to distinguish D0(A) from D0(A') shifted by 4(k'-k), even though these modules have the same graded Betti numbers.",

We establish that the form-defined operator $T_g$ and the natural-domain operator $U_g$ decouple in the unbounded symbols regime: while $T_g$ is governed by linear averaging, $U_g$ is controlled by the quadratic intensity of $|g|^2$. We construct a smooth, nonnegative radial symbol $g$ satisfying the coherent-state admissibility hypothesis with bounded heat transforms for all time $t>0$; for this symbol, $T_g$ is bounded, yet $U_g$ is unbounded. This is a strictly global phenomenon: under the coherent-state hypothesis, local singularities are insufficient to cause unboundedness, leaving the ``geometry at infinity'' as the sole obstruction. Boundedness of $U_g$ is equivalent to the condition that $|g|^2 d\u03bc$ is a Fock--Carleson measure, a condition strictly stronger than the linear average $g d\u03bc$ governing $T_g$. Finally, regarding the gap between the known sub-critical sufficiency condition and the critical heat time, we prove that heat-flow regularity is irreversible in this context and show that bootstrapping strategies cannot resolve the gap between sufficiency and critical time.",

In their work, Chandan et al. characterized the expressions for the rate-privacy trade-offs for these classes of WPIR schemes, under the mutual information leakage and maximal leakage metrics. Explicit achievable trade-offs for the same were also presented, which were shown to be competitive or better than prior WPIR schemes. However, the class-wise optimality of the reported trade-offs were unknown. In this work, we show that the explicit rate-privacy trade-offs reported for the Sun-Jafar-type schemes by Chandan et al. are optimal for the non-colluding and replicated setting. Furthermore, we prove the class-wise optimality for Banawan-Ulukus-type MDS-WPIR and Sun-Jafar-type $T$-colluding WPIR schemes, under threshold-constraints on the system parameters. When these threshold-constraints do not hold, we present counter-examples which show that even higher rates than those reported before can be achieved.",

At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case.",

For each model this closed evolution equation provides an approximate description for the evolution of the appropriate covariance function in the system. It is obtained by truncating the cumulant hierarchy and dropping the higher order cumulants in the usual manner. To have such a reference solution should simplify controlling the full hierarchy and thus allow estimating the error from the truncation. The harmonic part is given by nearest neighbour hopping, with arbitrary symmetric interaction potential of coupling strength $\u03bb>0$. We consider the well-posedness of the resulting evolution equation up to finite kinetic times on a finite but large enough lattice. We obtain decay of the solutions and upper bounds that are independent of $\u03bb$ and depend on the lattice size only via some Sobolev type norms of the interaction potential and initial data.

    "abstract": "Visible light communication (VLC) is emerging as a key technology for future wireless communication systems due to its unique physical-layer advantages over traditional radio-frequency (RF)-based systems. However, its integration with higher-layer techniques, such as semantic communication, remains underexplored. This paper investigates the energy efficiency maximization problem in a resource-constrained VLC-based probabilistic semantic communication (PSCom) system. In the considered model, light-emitting diode (LED) transmitters perform semantic compression to reduce data size, which incurs additional computation overhead. The compressed semantic information is transmitted to the users for semantic inference using a shared knowledge base that requires periodic updates to ensure synchronization. In the PSCom system, the knowledge base is represented by probabilistic graphs. To enable simultaneous transmission of both knowledge and information data, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is employed. The optimization problem focuses on maximizing energy efficiency by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming, direct current (DC) bias, common rate allocation, and semantic compression ratio, while accounting for both communication and computation costs. To solve this problem, an alternating optimization algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) and Dinkelbach method is developed. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Each user requests an arbitrary file from the library. The goal is to design coded caching schemes that simultaneously achieve the maximum sum degrees of freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization. In this paper, we first introduce a unified combinatorial structure, termed the MIMO placement delivery array (MIMO-PDA), which characterizes uncoded placement and one-shot zero-forcing delivery. By analyzing the combinatorial properties of MIMO-PDAs, we derive a sum-DoF upper bound of $\\min\\{KG, Gt+G\\lceil L/G \\rceil\\}$, where $t=KM/N$, which coincides with the optimal DoF characterization in prior work by Tehrani \\emph{et al.}. Based on this upper bound, we present two novel constructions of MIMO-PDAs that achieve the maximum sum-DoF. The first construction achieves linear subpacketization under stringent parameter constraints, while the second achieves ordered exponential subpacketization under substantially milder constraints. Theoretical analysis and numerical comparisons demonstrate that the second construction exponentially reduces subpacketization compared to existing schemes while preserving the maximum sum-DoF.",

    "title": "Basis-Spline Assisted Coded Computing: Strategies and Error Bounds",
    "abstract": "Coded computing has become a key framework for reliable distributed computation over decentralized networks, effectively mitigating the impact of stragglers. Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our framework significantly outperforms Berrut-based methods for various non-polynomial functions.",

    "abstract": "This work establishes the fundamental limits of the classical problem of multi-user distributed computing of linearly separable functions. In particular, we consider a distributed computing setting involving $L$ users, each requesting a linearly separable function over $K$ basis subfunctions from a master node, who is assisted by $N$ distributed servers. At the core of this problem lies a fundamental tradeoff between communication and computation: each server can compute up to $M$ subfunctions, and each server can communicate linear combinations of their locally computed subfunctions outputs to at most $\u0394$ users. The objective is to design a distributed computing scheme that reduces the communication cost (total amount of data from servers to users), and towards this, for any given $K$, $L$, $M$, and $\u0394$, we propose a distributed computing scheme that jointly designs the task assignment and transmissions, and shows that the scheme achieves optimal performance in the real field under various conditions using a novel converse. We also characterize the performance of the scheme in the finite field using another converse based on counting arguments.",

Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \\textit{et al.} are layered. Then, a cost-aware optimization problem is derived that optimizes cache placement and minimizes system cost. By identifying a sparsity property of the optimal solution, we propose a structure-aware algorithm with reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme consistently outperforms the scheme of Cheng {\\it et al.} in scenarios with heterogeneous retrieval costs.",

While the capacity of the noiseless frequency-based channel has been previously addressed, the effect of identification noise has not been fully characterized. We present a converse bound on the channel capacity that follows from stochastic degradation and the data processing inequality. We then establish an achievable bound, which is based on a Poissonization of the multinomial sampling process, and an analysis of the resulting vector Poisson channel with inter-symbol interference. This analysis refines concentration inequalities for the information density used in Feinstein bound, and explicitly characterizes an additive loss in the mutual information due to identification noise.

Guruswami and Wootters first proposed a linear repair scheme for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, showing that they can be repaired with lower bandwidth than the naive approach. The existence of RS codes achieving the MSR point (RS-MSR codes) nevertheless remained open until the breakthrough construction of Tamo, Barg, and Ye, which yields RS-MSR codes with subpacketization $\\ell = s \\prod_{i=1}^n p_i$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes satisfying $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{s}$ and $s=d+1-k$.\n  In this paper, we present an improved construction of RS-MSR codes by eliminating the congruence condition $p_i \\equiv 1 \\pmod{s}$.

    "abstract": "It is well-known in the field of lossless data compression that probabilistic next-symbol prediction can be used to compress sequences of symbols. Deep neural networks are able to capture rich dependencies in data, offering a powerful means of estimating these probabilities and hence an avenue towards more effective compression algorithms. However, both compressor and decompressor must have exactly matching predictions; even small non-deterministic differences (which often happen with learned models due to hardware, software, or computation order) can lead to cascading decoding failures. In this paper, we formalize the problem of prediction mismatch in model-driven compression, and introduce Probability Matching Interval Coding (PMATIC), a model-agnostic algorithm that tolerates bounded prediction mismatch with low overhead. PMATIC works with the predicted probabilities, making it compatible as a drop-in replacement for the arithmetic encoder in model-driven compression tools. We show theoretical correctness and performance bounds for PMATIC, and validate these results on text data. These results confirm that, when paired an advanced prediction model, PMATIC is robust to prediction mismatch while achieving compression rates that out-perform standard modern compression tools.",

Many scientific and economic applications instead involve longitudinal or panel data, in which each user contributes multiple dependent observations. In these settings, item-level DP offers inadequate protection, and user-level DP - shielding an individual's entire trajectory - is the appropriate privacy notion. We develop a comprehensive framework for estimation and inference in longitudinal linear regression under user-level DP. We propose a user-level private regression estimator based on aggregating local regressions, and we establish finite-sample guarantees and asymptotic normality under short-range dependence. For inference, we develop a privatized, bias-corrected covariance estimator that is automatically heteroskedasticity- and autocorrelation-consistent.

Iterative eigensolvers may be preferred over direct methods for this task since their complexity is a function of the desired fraction of the spectrum. In addition, they generally rely on highly optimized and scalable kernels such as matrix-vector multiplications that leverage the massive parallelism and the computational power of modern exascale systems. \\textit{Chebyshev Accelerated Subspace iteration Eigensolver} (ChASE) is able to compute several thousands of the most extreme eigenpairs of dense hermitian matrices with proven scalability over massive parallel accelerated clusters. This work presents an extension of ChASE to solve for a portion of the spectrum of pseudo-hermitian Hamiltonians as they appear in the treatment of excitonic materials. The new pseudo-hermitian solver achieves similar convergence and performance as the hermitian one. By exploiting the numerical structure and spectral properties of the Hamiltonian matrix, we propose an oblique variant of Rayleigh-Ritz projection featuring quadratic convergence of the Ritz-values with no explicit construction of the dual basis set. Additionally, we introduce a parallel implementation of the recursive matrix-product operation appearing in the Chebyshev filter with limited amount of global communications.

The inducibility of $F$, defined as $i(F)=\\lim_{n\\to \\infty} I(F,n)/\\binom{n}{v(F)}$, is a central problem in extremal graph theory. In this work, we investigate the inducibility of Tur\u00e1n graphs $F$. This topic has been extensively studied in the literature, including works of Pippenger--Golumbic, Brown--Sidorenko, Bollob\u00e1s--Egawa--Harris--Jin, Mubayi, Reiher, and the first author, and Yuster. Broadly speaking, these results resolve or asymptotically resolve the problem when the part sizes of $F$ are either sufficiently large or sufficiently small (at most four).\n  We complete this picture by proving that for every Tur\u00e1n graph $F$ and sufficiently large $n$, the value $I(F,n)$ is attained uniquely by the $m$-partite Tur\u00e1n graph on $n$ vertices, where $m$ is given explicitly in terms of the number of parts and vertices of $F$. This confirms a conjecture of Bollob\u00e1s--Egawa--Harris--Jin from 1995, and we also establish the corresponding stability theorem. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic analogue for $I_{k+1}(F,n)$, the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ in an $n$-vertex $K_{k+1}$-free graph, thereby completely resolving a recent problem of Yuster. Finally, our results extend to a broader class of complete multipartite graphs in which the largest and smallest part sizes differ by at most on the order of the square root of the smallest part size.",

    "abstract": "The addition of the running time as a component of a path before computing its signature is a widespread approach to ensure the one-to-one property between them and leads to universal approximation theorems (Cuchiero, Primavera and Svaluto-Ferro, 2023). However, this also leads to the linear dependence of the components of the terminal value of the signature of the time-augmented path. More precisely, for a given natural number $N$, the signature components associated with words of length $N$ have the same linear span as the signature components associated with words of length not greater than $N$. We generalize this result by exhibiting other subfamilies of signature components with the same spanning properties. In particular we recover the result of Dupire and Tissot-Daguette which states that the spanning of the iterated integrals with the last integrator different from the time variable is the same as the spanning of all iterated integrals. We check that this choice leads to the minimal computation time when the terms of the signature are calculated using Chen's relation in a backward way. The same optimal computation time is symmetrically achieved in a forward way for the iterated integrals with the first integrator different from the time variable. Building on these results, we derive several results regarding the linear independence of the signature components of a time-augmented stochastic process. We show that if the stochastic process we consider is solution to some SDE with additive Brownian noise then any subfamily of components proposed previously is linearly independent. We also prove that the linear independence of these subfamilies of components is still true when we consider the discretization of the sample paths of this stochastic process on a grid with a sufficiently small discretization time step.",

    "abstract": "Burst errors involving simultaneous insertions, deletions, and substitutions occur in practical scenarios, including DNA data storage and document synchronization, motivating developments of channel codes that can correct such errors. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity.",

While existing literature extensively covers link-level designs, the transition toward large-scale deployment necessitates a fundamental understanding of network-level performance. This paper investigates a network ISAC model where a source node communicates with a destination via a relay network, while intermediate nodes concurrently perform cooperative sensing over specific spatial regions. We formulate a novel optimization framework that captures the interplay between multi-node routing and sensing coverage. For a one-dimensional path network, we provide an analytical characterization of the complete sensing-throughput region. Extending this to general network topologies, we establish that the sensing-throughput Pareto boundary is piecewise linear and provide physical interpretations for each segment. Our results reveal the fundamental trade-offs between sensing coverage and communication routing, offering key insights for the design of future 6G heterogeneous networks.",

    "abstract": "Coded caching is recognized as an effective method for alleviating network congestion during peak periods by leveraging local caching and coded multicasting gains. The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed schemes not only achieves lower transmission load than existing linear subpacketization schemes but also approaches the performance of certain exponential subpacketization schemes.",

Based on this generalized framework, we propose a t-design-based coded caching scheme for combinatorial multi-access networks. We characterize a class of design parameters under which every active user has access to a sufficient number of coded subfiles to decode its requested file, and show that appropriate parameter choices allow for the elimination of redundant multicast transmissions. As a result, the proposed scheme achieves a family of rate memory trade offs with flexible subpacketization.

We focus on the extensive-width regime, where the teacher and student network widths scale proportionally with the input dimension, and the sample size grows quadratically. This scaling aims to describe overparameterized neural networks in which feature learning still plays a central role. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a dynamical characterization of the gradient flow, in the spirit of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). Under l2-regularization, we analyze these equations at long times and characterize the performance and spectral properties of the resulting estimator. This result provides a quantitative understanding of the effect of overparameterization on learning and generalization, and reveals a double descent phenomenon in the presence of label noise, where generalization improves beyond interpolation. In the small regularization limit, we obtain an exact expression for the perfect recovery threshold as a function of the network widths, providing a precise characterization of how overparameterization influences recovery.",

Dattoli and collaborators with the aim of devising a working computational tool in the framework of special function theory. Concepts like umbral image and umbral vacuum have been introduced as pivotal elements of the discussion, which, albeit effective, lacks of generality.\n  This article is directed towards endowing the formalism with a rigorous formulation within the context of the formal power series with complex coefficients $(\\mathbb{C}[[ t ]], \\partial)$. The new formulation is founded on the definition of the umbral operator $\\operatorname{\\mathfrak{u}}$ as a functional in the \"umbral ground state\" subalgebra of analytically convergent formal series $\\varphi \\in \\mathbb{C}\\{t\\}$.\n  We consider in detail some specific classes of umbral ground states $\\varphi$ and analyse the conditions for analytic convergence of the corresponding umbral identities, defined as formal series resulting from the action on $\\varphi$ of operators of the form $f(\u03b6\\operatorname{\\mathfrak{u}}^\u03bc)$ with $f \\in \\mathbb{C}\\{t\\}$ and $\u03bc, \u03b6\\in \\mathbb{C}$. For these umbral states, we exploit the Gevrey classification of formal power series to establish a connection with the theory of Borel-Laplace resummation, enabling to make rigorous sense of a large class of -- even divergent -- umbral identities.\n  As an application of the proposed theoretical framework, we introduce and investigate the properties of new umbral images for the Gaussian trigonometric functions, which emphasise the trigonometric-like nature of these functions and enable to define the concept of \"Gaussian Fourier transform\", a potentially powerful tool for applications.",

    "abstract": "The finite element method is an indispensable tool in engineering, but its computational complexity prevents applications for control or at system-level. Model order reduction bridges this gap, creating highly efficient yet accurate surrogate models. Reducing nonlinear setups additionally requires hyperreduction. Compatibility with commercial finite element software requires non-intrusive methods based on data. Methods include the trajectory piecewise linear approach, or regression, typically via neural networks. Important aspects for these methods are accuracy, efficiency, generalization, including desired physical and mathematical properties, and extrapolation. Especially the last two aspects are problematic for neural networks. Therefore, several studies investigated how to incorporate physical knowledge or desirable properties. A promising approach from constitutive modeling is physics augmented neural networks. This concept has been elegantly transferred to hyperreduction by Fleres et al. in 2025 and guarantees several desired properties, incorporates physics, can include parameters, and results in smaller architectures. We augment this reference work by second-order Sobolev training, i.e., using a function and its first two derivatives. These are conveniently accessible and promise improved performance. Further modifications are proposed and studied. While Sobolev training does not meet expectations, several minor changes improve accuracy by up to an order of magnitude. Eventually, our best model is compared to reference work and the trajectory piecewise linear approach. The comparison relies on the same numerical case study as the reference work and additionally emphasizes extrapolation due to its critical role in typical applications. Our results indicate quick divergence of physics-augmented neural networks for extrapolation, preventing its deployment.",

We explain how the modes of sections of $V$ give rise naturally to $V$-valued quasi-modular forms. The space $Q(V)$ of $V$-valued quasi-modular forms is endowed with the structure of a doubled QVOA, and in particular the algebra $Q$ of quasi-modular forms is itself a doubled QVOA. $Q(V)$ also admits a natural derivative operator arising from the connection on the bundle defined by $V$ and the modular derivative, which we call the raising operator. We introduce an associated lowering operator $\u039b$ on $Q(V)$ having the property that the $V$-valued modular forms $M(V)\\subseteq Q(V)$ are the kernel of $\u039b$. This extends the classical theory of scalar-valued quasi-modular forms. We exhibit an explicit isomorphism of $M(V)$ with $M \\otimes V$. Finally, the coordinate invariance of vertex operators implies that $M(V)$ has a natural Hecke theory, and we use this isomorphism to fully describe the Hecke eigensystems: they are the same as the systems of eigenvalues that arise from scalar-valued quasi-modular forms.",

Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit classical bits, we allow them to send classical information over quantum channels to the newcomer. The newcomer then generates its storage by performing appropriate measurements on the received quantum states. In this setting, we fully characterize the fundamental tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth (total communication cost). Compared to classical systems, the optimal storage--bandwidth tradeoff can be significantly improved with the enhancement of quantum entanglement shared only among the surviving nodes, particularly at the minimum-storage regenerating point. Remarkably, we show that when $d \\geq 2k-2$, there exists an operating point at which \\textit{both storage and repair bandwidth are simultaneously minimized}. This phenomenon breaks the tradeoff in the classical setting and reveals a fundamentally new regime enabled by quantum communication.",

    "title": "A Construction Framework of Coded Caching Scheme for Multi-Access MIMO Systems via Knapsack Problem",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the coded caching problem in a multi-access multiple-input single-output (MAMISO) network with the combinatorial topology. The considered system consists of a server containing $N$ files, $\u039b$ cache nodes, and $K$ cache-less users, where each user can access a unique subset of $r$ cache nodes. The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity. To address this challenge, we formulate the design of multi-antenna placement delivery arrays (MAPDA) as a $0$--$1$ knapsack problem to maximize the achievable DoF, thereby transforming the complex combinatorial caching structure into a tractable optimization framework that yields efficient cache placement and flexible delivery strategies. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that: for networks with combinatorial topologies, the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum-DoF than existing schemes. Under identical cache size constraints, the subpacketization level remains comparable to existing linear subpacketization schemes. Moreover, under specific system conditions, the proposed scheme attains the theoretical maximum sum-DoF of $\\min\\{L+KM/N, K\\}$ while achieving further reductions subpacketization. For particular combinatorial structures, we further derive optimized constructions that achieve even higher sum-DoF with lower subpacketization. ```",

    "abstract": "We consider a discontinuous Galerkin method for the numerical solution of boundary value problems in two-dimensional domains with curved boundaries. A key challenge in this setting is the potential loss of convergence order due to approximating the physical domain by a polygonal mesh. Unless boundary conditions can be accurately transferred from the true boundary to the computational one, such geometric approximation errors generally lead to suboptimal convergence. To overcome this limitation, a higher-order strategy based on polynomial reconstruction of boundary data was introduced for classical finite element methods in [28, 29] and in the finite volume context in [7, 11]. More recently, this approach was extended to discontinuous Galerkin methods in [32], leading to the DG-ROD method, which restores optimal convergence rates on polygonal approximations of domains with curved boundaries. In this work, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of the DG-ROD method, establishing existence and uniqueness of the discrete solution and deriving error estimates for a two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion-reaction problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions on both convex and non-convex domains. Following and extending techniques from classical finite element methods [29], we prove that, under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution, the DG-ROD method achieves optimal convergence despite polygonal approximations. Finally, we illustrate and confirm the theoretical results with a numerical benchmark.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study efficient codebook design for limited feedback in extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) frequency division duplexing (FDD) systems. It is worth noting that existing codebook designs for XL-MIMO, such as polar-domain codebook, have not well taken into account user (location) distribution in practice, thereby incurring excessive feedback overhead. To address this issue, we propose in this paper a novel and efficient feedback codebook tailored to user distribution. To this end, we first consider a typical scenario where users are uniformly distributed within a specific polar-region, based on which a sum-rate maximization problem is formulated to jointly optimize angle-range samples and bit allocation among angle/range feedback. This problem is challenging to solve due to the lack of a closed-form expression for the received power in terms of angle and range samples. By leveraging a Voronoi partitioning approach, we show that uniform angle sampling is optimal for received power maximization. For more challenging range sampling design, we obtain a tight lower-bound on the received power and show that geometric sampling, where the ratio between adjacent samples is constant, can maximize the lower bound and thus serves as a high-quality suboptimal solution. We then extend the proposed framework to accommodate more general non-uniform user distribution via an alternating sampling method. Furthermore, theoretical analysis reveals that as the array size increases, the optimal allocation of feedback bits increasingly favors range samples at the expense of angle samples. Finally, numerical results validate the superior rate performance and robustness of the proposed codebook design under various system setups, achieving significant gains over benchmark schemes, including the widely used polar-domain codebook.",

    "abstract": "Polar codes are usually constructed by ranking synthetic bit-channels according to reliability, which guarantees capacity-achieving behavior but can yield poor low-weight spectra at short and moderate lengths. Recent algebraic results express the contribution of individual bit-channels to the multiplicities of minimum and near-minimum weight codewords in closed form. In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity. Numerical results for short and moderate lengths on BPSK-AWGN, implemented via Gaussian approximation and closed-form weight contributions, illustrate the trade-off between pure reliability-based and mixed constructions in terms of minimum distance, multiplicity, and union-bound approximations. All proofs are deferred to the appendices.",

    "abstract": "In the $(L,K,M,N)$ cache-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) system, the server is equipped with $L$ antennas and communicates with $K$ single-antenna users through a wireless broadcast channel where the server has a library containing $N$ files, and each user is equipped with a cache of size $M$ files. Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization.",

We expect their representation theory to be of interest for future works.
