    "title": "Steady states and dynamics of a higher dimensional thin film equation",
    "abstract": "We study a higher-dimensional thin film equation that incorporates competitive effects between aggregation and repulsion, where repulsion is modeled by fourth-order diffusion and aggregation by backward second-order degenerate diffusion, with a degenerate diffusion exponent $m>0$. We first conduct a systematic analysis of the existence and geometric properties of steady-state solutions for all $m>0$, revealing a critical threshold $m^*=(d+2)/(d-2)$ for variational compactness and solution structure. For $0 < m < m^*$, we then prove that, under natural regularity constraints, radially decreasing steady states coincide with both the extremals of the Gagliardo-Nirenberg-Sobolev inequality and the global minimizers of the free energy. Moreover, we establish the uniqueness of such steady states for $m \\neq 1 + 2/d$. Furthermore, in the supercritical regime $1 + 2/d < m < m^*$, we identify a sharp threshold given by the $L^{m+1}$ norm of the unique radial steady-state solution, which distinguishes between global existence for initial data below the threshold and finite-time blow-up for initial data above the threshold. The main contribution of this work is to use steady-state solutions as a theoretical pivot to construct a unified analytical framework that connects parameter classification, variational structure and dynamic behavior. This framework elucidates how the regularity barrier prevents infinite energy descent and selects stable equilibrium states, and thus predicts the global evolution of the system, thereby providing a unified variational principle for understanding steady-state selection and dynamic bifurcations in such higher-order degenerate diffusion equations.",

Under an infinite radius of convergence assumption, we prove density of linear functions on the signature in $L^p$ functions on grouplike elements, making it possible to represent a square-integrable function on (rough) paths as an $L^2$-convergent series. By viewing the shuffle algebra as commutative polynomials on the free Lie algebra, we revisit much of the theory of classical orthogonal polynomials in several variables, such as the recurrence relation and Favard's theorem. Finally, we restrict our attention to the case of Brownian motion with and without drift, and prove that dimension-independent orthogonal signature exists with drift but not without. We end with numerical examples of how orthogonal signature polynomials of Brownian motion can be applied for the approximation of functions on paths sampled from the Wiener measure.",

    "abstract": "Statistical solutions of incompressible Euler describe turbulent dynamics as time-parameterized laws on $L^2$ whose multi-point correlations satisfy an infinite hierarchy of weak identities. Modern generative samplers for PDE forecasting (flow matching, rectified flows, diffusion via probability-flow ODEs) are measure-transport mechanisms and therefore induce Markov operators on laws. We develop a law-level analysis compatible with the correlation-measure framework of Lanthaler--Mishra--Par\u00e9s-Pulido (LM): convergence in $d_T(\u03bc,\u03bd)=\\int_{0}^{T} W_{1}\\!\\bigl(\u03bc_t,\u03bd_t\\bigr)\\,\\mathrm{d}t$, compactness controlled by structure functions, and identification of limits through hierarchy identities.\n  Quantitatively, we prove a $W_2$ stability estimate whose growth rate is a distance-weighted average strain under optimal couplings, and a one-step error decomposition into a resolved mismatch term and an unavoidable high-frequency coverage tail controlled by structure-function (spectral) bounds. These inputs propagate through multi-step rollouts via a discrete Gr\u00f6nwall recursion with amplification governed by the average-strain exponent rather than a worst-case Lipschitz constant. On the qualitative side, sampler-native path controls yield LM time regularity; together with uniform energy and structure-function bounds this gives precompactness in $d_T$ and strong convergence of LM-admissible observables. If hierarchy residuals vanish along a sequence, every limit is an LM statistical solution, with residuals bounded by training-native drift/score regression errors. Finally, we show how common finite-grid diagnostics--proper distributional scores and likelihood-style certificates--admit principled interpretations as resolved observables within the same statistical-solution framework.",

    "abstract": "Wave propagation in multilayered media with high material contrasts poses significant numerical challenges, as large variations in wavenumbers lead to strong reflections and complex transmission of the incoming wave field. To address these difficulties, we employ a boundary integral formulation thereby avoiding volumetric discretization. In this framework, the accuracy of the numerical solution depends strongly on how the material interfaces are discretized. In this work, we demonstrate that standard meshing strategies based on resolving the maximum wavenumber across the domain become computationally inefficient in multilayered configurations, where high wavenumbers are confined to localized subdomains. Through a systematic study of multilayer transmission problems, we show that no simple discretization rule based on the maximum wavenumber or material contrasts emerges. Instead, the wavenumber of the background (exterior) medium plays a dominant role in determining the optimal boundary resolution. Building on these insights, we propose an adaptive approach that achieves uniform accuracy and efficient computation across multiple layers. Numerical experiments for a range of multilayer configurations demonstrate the scalability and robustness of the proposed approach.",

This paper proposes several new reformulations for 0-1 quadratic programming problems using the QNR technique. Such a technique provides more flexibility in adding nonconvex quadratic constraints into the problem formulation, so that some valid inequalities, such as the triangle inequalities, can be incorporated into the formulation to tighten the lower bound of the problem. We analyze the effects of the proposed reformulations on the lower bounds implemented in the solver, and propose some methods to maximize the McCormick relaxation bounds of the reformulations.

    "abstract": "The Euler characteristic transform (ECT) is an emerging and powerful framework within topological data analysis for quantifying the geometry of shape. The applicability of ECT has been limited due to its sensitivity to noisy data. Here, we introduce SampEuler, a novel ECT-based shape descriptor designed to achieve enhanced robustness to perturbations. We provide a theoretical analysis establishing the stability of SampEuler and validate these properties empirically through pairwise similarity analyses on a benchmark dataset and showcase it on a thymus dataset. The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ that is essential for the maturation and selection of self-tolerant T cells, and within the thymus, thymic epithelial cells are organized in complex three-dimensional architectures, yet the principles governing their formation, functional organization, and remodeling during age-related involution remain poorly understood. Addressing these questions requires robust and informative shape descriptors capable of capturing subtle architectural changes across developmental stages. We develop and apply SampEuler to a newly generated two-dimensional imaging dataset of mouse thymi spanning multiple age groups, where SampEuler outperforms both persistent homology--based methods and deep learning models in detecting subtle, localized morphological differences associated with aging. To facilitate interpretation, we develop a vectorization and visualization framework for SampEuler, which preserves rich morphological information and enables identification of structural features that distinguish thymi across age groups. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SampEuler provides a robust and interpretable approach for quantifying thymic architecture and reveals age-dependent structural changes that offer new insights into thymic organization and involution.",

The objective is to maximize the expected total reward relative to that of a prophet who observes all rewards in advance. This problem captures the performance limits achievable in online resource allocation and underlies posted-price mechanisms in online marketplaces. We characterize the optimal welfare achievable relative to the prophet in terms of $k$ and the extreme value index of the reward distribution, in the asymptotic regime where the number of offers $n$ grows large. This optimal performance ratio turns out to be at least $1-\\frac{\\log k}{8k}[1+\u03b5]$ for any $\u03b5> 0$ and sufficiently large $k$, improving upon the respective, tight $1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\u03c0k}}$ guarantee of static-threshold algorithms. We additionally analyze the certainty-equivalent (CE) heuristic, a widely used online allocation algorithm known to yield optimal regret growth in $n$ when evaluated under the fluid scaling assumption. Even in the absence of the fluid scaling, the CE heuristics's performance improves with $k$ to eventually match the leading order terms of the optimal dynamic program's performance ratio. A finer analysis nevertheless reveals that regret can be divergent and large relative to the optimal dynamic program when $n/k \\to \\infty$. This highlights the sensitivity in viewing the CE heuristic's performance under the commonly adopted, though subjective, fluid scaling assumption.",

To address this challenge, we introduce Unbalanced Synchronized Optimal Transport (UnSyncOT), a novel dynamical framework that synchronizes transport-reaction flows between spaces via either geometric embeddings (Monge type) or Markov kernels (Kantorovich type). For both cases we prove that UnSyncOT can be reduced to a single-space problem: the Monge model becomes a Benamou-Brenier problem with a metric-modified kinetic energy, and the Kantorovich model yields a nonlocal action induced by the synchronization operator, both of which fit within a dissipation-distance formulation. We also analyze the pure transport (Wasserstein) and pure reaction (Fisher-Rao) limits and derive structural properties. For the Kantorovich case we propose an approximate UnSyncOT by introducing a Hellinger-Kantorovich based trapezoidal time discretization of the secondary action for efficient computation. Finally we present staggered-grid discretizations and primal-dual solvers, validate the convergence, stability, and efficiency, and demonstrate coherent dynamics reconstructions across spaces.",

Serrano proposed a corresponding definition of skew shifted plactic Schur functions. Cho (2013) disproved Serrano's conjecture regarding this definition, by showing that the functions do not live in the desired ring and hence cannot provide an algebraic interpretation of tableau rectification or of the corresponding structure coefficients.

In other words, choosing a representative from each set produces a complete distance graph (i.e. equilateral set). We say such a spacing is maximal if each $Y_i$ is maximal under inclusion. In this work we characterize maximal equidistant spacings in $\\mathbb R^n$. For each equidistant spacing there is an associated center (a point in $\\mathbb R^n$) and radius (a non-negative scalar) so that the centers form an orthocentric system. Using arguments from classical geometry we find that the moduli space of maximal equidistant spacings is described in terms of the movement of its center and radii. Using tools from geometric combinatorics, we develop a discrete combinatorial object called the signature. Our classification theorem shows that maximal equidistant spacings are isometric if and only if they have the same signature. We also construct all maximal equidistant spacings in $\\mathbb R^1,\\mathbb R^2$ and $\\mathbb R^3$, outline a procedure for constructing all maximal equidistant spacings in $\\mathbb R^n$, and give an algorithm for checking if a locus of points is equidistantly spaced that is linear in the number of points, an improvement over the naive direct quadratic algorithm.",

Despite extensive analytical progress, the nonlinear and degenerate nature of this problem has hindered the development of rigorous numerical analysis in this area. As the first step toward addressing this gap, we study the numerical approximation of Weyl's problem, i.e., the isometric embedding of two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with positive Gaussian curvature into $\\mathbb{R}^3$, by establishing a new weak formulation that naturally leads to a numerical scheme well suited for high-order finite element discretization, and conducting a systematic analysis to prove the well-posedness of this weak formulation, the existence and uniqueness of its numerical solution, as well as its convergence with error estimates. This provides a foundational framework for computing isometric embeddings of Riemannian manifolds into Euclidean space, with the goal of extending it to a broader range of cases and applications in the future. Our framework also extends naturally to the isometric embedding of the Ricci flow, with rigorous error estimates, enabling the visualization of geometric evolutions in intrinsic curvature flows. Numerical experiments support the theoretical analysis by demonstrating the convergence of the method and its effectiveness in simulating isometric embeddings of given Riemannian manifolds as well as Ricci flows.",

Unlike traditional binary iterative convolution-thresholding method (ICTM), this continuous median filter scheme effectively overcomes the pinning effect caused by spatial discretization, achieving accurate interface evolution even with small time steps. We also provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving the unconditional energy stability of the iterative scheme. Furthermore, we prove that for a wide class of data fidelity terms, the convex relaxation inherently enforces a binary solution, justifying the effectiveness of the method without explicit penalization. Numerical experiments on the Chan--Vese model, the local intensity fitting (LIF) model, and topology optimization in Stokes flow demonstrate that the proposed efficient continuous framework effectively eliminates the pinning effect, guarantees unconditional energy stability, and accurately converges to binary solutions.",

Working over a fixed parameter set, we treat entourages as soft relations and introduce a notion of \\emph{soft uniformity} whose axioms parallel the classical entourage approach. Every soft uniformity induces a canonical soft topology; moreover, the uniformity is separated exactly when the induced topology is soft $T_1$, and the induced topology is soft regular. We then study soft uniformly continuous mappings and prove a soft Heine--Cantor type theorem: on a soft compact domain, soft continuity already forces soft uniform continuity. Finally, soft total boundedness and soft completeness are formulated via soft Cauchy filters, and we show that soft compactness implies both properties.

    "abstract": "A class of dissipative dynamical systems evolving on smooth constraint hypersurfaces endowed with degenerate induced bilinear forms is studied. The intrinsic evolution is generated by constraint--preserving vector fields on manifolds whose tangent bundles admit a nontrivial null distribution associated with the degeneracy of the induced structure. In this indefinite setting, the absence of coercive Lyapunov functionals prevents the direct application of classical attractor theory developed for Riemannian phase spaces. Dissipation is instead characterized relative to functionals that are compatible with the null distribution and exhibit decay exclusively in directions transverse to the associated foliation. Under suitable involutivity and regularity assumptions on the null distribution, all bounded trajectories are shown to be asymptotically confined to invariant leaves of the corresponding foliation. Asymptotic compactness of the intrinsic evolution is then established without coercivity by reducing the dynamics to a projected semiflow on the quotient manifold determined by the characteristic distribution. In the presence of a bounded absorbing set and continuous semiflow structure, the intrinsic evolution admits a compact global attractor saturated by the null leaves, whose effective asymptotic dynamics are governed by a compact invariant subset of the reduced phase space. Furthermore, when the compatible functional satisfies a Morse--type nondegeneracy condition in directions transverse to the null distribution and the induced transversal linearization admits no center spectrum, the projected semiflow possesses no neutral directions. The resulting framework provides a mechanism by which constraint--induced degeneracy enforces effective dimensional reduction in dissipative geometric evolution systems.",

Under this definition, two expressions are identical if they represent the same rational function; for example, $x_1-x_2-x_3$ and $x_1-(x_2+x_3)$ are identical arithmetic expressions, as are $x_1(x_2+x_3)$ and $(x_2+x_3)x_1$. Two arithmetic expressions are said to be isomorphic if one can be obtained from the other by a permutation of the variables. For example, $(x_1-x_2)/x_3$ and $(x_2-x_3)/x_1$ are isomorphic. The first few values of the number of non-isomorphic arithmetic expressions with n variables are: $$1,4,18,93,500,2844,16621,99674,608448,...$$ In order to accomplish this enumeration, we classify the set of all arithmetic expressions into 12 disjoint categories.

Algebraic topology is deeply connected to category theory because it studies spaces by translating them into algebraic objects through structure-preserving mappings. The homology functor translates structural properties into a set of layered invariants called homology groups. The templex is shown here to play the same role for directed spaces that cell complexes play for spaces. The directed properties of a templex are found therewith to admit a functorial formulation. This formulation provides a rigorous foundation for a theory of chaos topology developed so far algorithmically, and establishes operationally a topological criterion for finite-time chaos.

While many existing methods can compute approximate eigenpairs with sufficiently small backward errors, the magnitude of the resulting forward errors is often unknown.

To address this issue, we propose an efficient approximation algorithm that aims to achieve a prescribed forward error, together with a high-accuracy numerical algorithm based on the Ozaki scheme -- an emulation technique for matrix multiplication -- adapted to this problem. Since the proposed method is not primarily focused on reducing backward errors, the computational cost can be significantly reduced.

We build on the key observation that discretizing such explicit formulas yields schemes that are exact in time (requiring only spatial discretization) and have a computational cost independent of the final time $T$. In this work, we first generalize the fully-discrete schemes of arXiv:2412.13480 to include numerical approximations with better structure preservation properties, including the conservation of mass and momentum in the case of the (BO) equation. Secondly, building on recent analyses of the corresponding Lax operators, we extend the convergence results to this class of schemes for rough solutions $u(t)$ merely belonging to $L^2(\\mathbb{T})$ for (BO) and $L^2_{+}(\\mathbb{T})$ for (CCM), the latter of which is precisely the scaling-critical regularity. Our main theorem states that the $L^2(\\mathbb{T})$-norm of the error goes to zero as the truncation parameters go to infinity, uniformly on any bounded time interval $[-T,T]$. As an example, we apply our scheme to the (BO) equation with a square-wave initial profile, and obtain the first numerical evidence of the Talbot effect for (BO) supported by a rigorous convergence result.",

Focusing on $X_{=t}$ (individuals in exactly $t$ subsets) and employing the MAO norm -- a combinatorial tool yielding closed-form factorial moments -- we derive the exact marginal distribution of a single individual as $\\mathrm{Bin}(T,p)$ with $p=m/N$. Using the MAO norm, we prove that for any fixed number of distinct individuals, their joint distribution differs from the product of marginals by $O(1/N)$, establishing the weak dependence required for limit theorems. Based on these findings, we delineate two asymptotic regimes: 1. Normal approximation: When $N\\to\\infty$ with $p=m/N$ fixed, $X_{=t}$ obeys a central limit theorem and can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean $N\u03c0_t$ and variance obtained from the MAO norm, where $\u03c0_t = \\binom{T}{t} p^t (1-p)^{T-t}$.2. Poisson approximation: When the expected value $\u03bb_N := N\u03c0_t \\to 0$, $X_{=t}$ converges in distribution to $\\mathrm{Poisson}(\u03bb)$. By symmetry, if $\u03bb_N \\to N$, then $N-X_{=t}$ converges to a Poisson distribution. All theoretical results are rigorously proved via moment methods and are corroborated by extensive numerical simulations, which further demonstrate that the approximations remain valid even when the subset sizes are not equal. The MAO norm thus emerges as a unifying tool that connects the exact combinatorial structure of the model to its asymptotic theory. These findings offer clear guidance for choosing the appropriate approximation in practical applications, and they open the door to using the MAO distribution as a null model for detecting non random aggregation in fields as diverse as ecology, sociology, and statistical physics.",

In this paper, we introduce a new strong property, the strong spectral property for weighted Laplacian matrices (SSPWL), and establish the corresponding Supergraph and Bifurcation lemmas. Instead of the space of symmetric matrices, the SSPWL considers the ambient space spanned by all weighted Laplacian matrices. Moreover, we provide a detailed study comparing the Jacobian Method and some strong properties, leading to a full understanding between these two techniques used in different problems. Using these tools, we identify the potential boundaries of the spectral regions of weighted Laplacian matrices associated with connected graphs on $4$ vertices, extending the analysis from the previous work [S.

For the embedding of a smooth curve $Y$ given by $E_Y \\otimes B, B$ a line bundle of degree $b$, we show that the restriction of the Picard bundle on $U^s_Y(n, d+nb)$ to $J(Y)$ is $\u03b8$-semistable for $b \\ge 2g-1$ and $\u03b8$-stable for $b \\ge 2g$. We also determine the relation between the restriction of the theta divisor on $U^s_Y(n,d+nb)$ to $J(Y)$ and the theta divisor $\u03b8$ on $\\overline{J}(Y)$.",

    "abstract": "A dual pair formulation for asymmetric locally convex spaces is developed that strictly generalises the ordinary vector space setting. The concept of a polar topology carries over to the asymmetric case and some familiar results are reproduced or generalised such as the bipolar theorem and a Mackey-Arens type theorem. The implications of weak compactness and countability properties are studied and appear intimately connected to separation properties. An asymmetric analogue $C_a(K)$ of the well-known space $C_p(K)$ is introduced and the properties of (relatively) (countably respectively sequentially) compact subspaces are investigated. In particular, it is shown that $C_a([0,1])$ is not angelic. However, for Hausdorff subspaces satisfying a simple closure condition, the different compactness conditions are equivalent and imply the Fr\u00e9chet-Urysohn property. Moreover, an analogue of the Eberlein-\u0160mulian theorem holds in asymmetrically normed spaces.",

    "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown (Gavrilov et al., Nonlinear Dyn, 112, 2024) that in a linear continuum system with time-varying parameters, the amplitude of a strongly localized mode can be calculated as a function of current parameter values and does not depend on the history of parameters change. This fact allows one to introduce the adiabatic invariant for such a system according to the general definition as a quantity that remains approximately constant in a system with several slowly time-varying parameters. In this paper, we show that, introduced in such a way, the adiabatic invariant can be calculated as the ratio of localized mode energy and its frequency. This yields a dramatically simplified way to solve a class of problems concerning localized oscillation of continuum systems with discrete inclusions, although it is not always clear enough what \"the mode energy\" is. The observed fact allows one to consider newly introduced adiabatic invariants as a straightforward generalization of a notion known to Hamiltonian systems.",

The models share a common capital budget equation but differ in their demographic laws, which are geometric, quasi-logistic, or epidemiologic (SIR-based). The quasi-logistic model is designed as an analytically tractable non-Ponzi investment system: it generalizes the geometric model (and, in the limit of a constant growth rate, reproduces classical Ponzi dynamics) while closely mirroring the behaviour of an SIR-based model with decreasing effective growth. In all cases, promised returns are modeled as fixed per-period payouts on initial investment with principal repaid upon exit, so that aggregate liabilities depend only on the current number of active investors. Within this unified framework, classical Ponzi schemes arise as special cases that inevitably collapse, while suitable parameter choices in the quasi-logistic and SIR-based versions generate finite-horizon, legally benign \"no-Ponzi game\" investment schemes with analytically transparent conditions for collapse, stability, and sustained operation.",

Two disjoint sets $A,B\\subset V(G)$ form a locating-dominating coalition (for short, an LD-coalition) in $G$ if none of them is an LD-set in $G$ but their union $A\\cup B$ is an LD-set. A locating-dominating coalition partition (for short, an LDC-partition) is a vertex partition $\u03a0$ such that every set of $\u03a0$ is not an LD-set in $G,$ but forms an LD-coalition with another set of $\u03a0$. The locating-domination coalition number of $G$, denoted by $C_{L}(G),$ equals the maximum cardinality of an LDC-partition of $G$. Our purpose in this paper is to initiate the study of locating-dominating coalitions in graphs. We first investigate the existence of LDC-partitions. We also obtain lower and upper bounds on $C_{L}(G)$. We characterize connected graphs $G$ of order $n\\ge 3$ satisfying $C_L(G) = n,$ as well as those trees $T$ such that $C_L(T)=n-1$. In addition, we determine the exact values of $C_L(G)$ for some classes of graphs. Moreover, we investigate the computational complexity of the decision problem associated with locating-dominating coalition partitions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the algorithmic complexity of a decision problem related to coalition partitions, not only for this locating-dominating model but for coalition partitions in general.",

Armed with integration by parts in the reverse form we provide an elementary derivation of an exact error represenation of Hermite quadrature rule. This approach possesses several advantages over the classical approaches: i) Only integration by parts is needed for the derivation; ii) the error representation requires much milder regularity, namely the existence of nth-order derivative rather than a (2n)th-order derivative of the function under consideration. As a result, our error formula is valid for less regular functions for which the classical ones are not valid; iii) our approach rediscovers Legendre polynomials and more interestingly it provides a surprisingly elegant relation between Legendre polynomial and Hermite interpolation. In particular, Legendre polynomials are precisely the error kernels for interpolatory Hermite quadrature rules; and iv) We also rediscover the Rodrigues formula for Legendre polynomials as part of our findings. For those who are interested in a different proof of the exact error representation for Hermite quadrature rule, we provide an alternative proof using the Peano kernel theorem. We also provide a composite interpolatory Hermite quadrature rule for practical applications.",

One way to take advantage of the spatial and temporal traits believed to characterize the solution is to encode them into the entries of a dictionary, and to seek the solution as a sparse linear combination of the dictionary atoms. To promote a vector of coefficients with mostly vanishing entries, we consider a stochastic extension of the dictionary coding problem model with a random hierarchical sparsity promoting prior. We compute the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the coefficient vector using the Iterative Alternating Sequential Algorithm (IAS), which has been demonstrated to efficiently solve inverse problems with minimal need for parameter tuning. The proposed methodology is tested on real-world dynamic Computed Tomography and MRI datasets, where it is compared to the popular Alternating Direction Method of Minimizers (ADMM). The computed examples show the that proposed methodology is competitive with the ADMM for compressed sensing, with a significantly lower sensitivity to hyper-parameter selection.",

We prove rigidity phenomena in both the deterministic and probabilistic settings. In the deterministic model of inscribed approximation, we show that if a single sequence of polytopes is asymptotically best for the volume and mean width difference simultaneously, then $K$ must be a Euclidean ball. In particular, the Euclidean ball is the unique $C_+^2$ convex body for which one sequence of polytopes can approximate all intrinsic volumes simultaneously at the optimal asymptotic rate.\n  In the probabilistic model, we prove a stronger statement: if a single sampling density on $\\partial K$ yields random inscribed polytopes that are asymptotically optimal (in expectation) for any two distinct intrinsic volume deviations, then $K$ must be a Euclidean ball. Moreover, using polarity, we establish dual versions of this rigidity theorem for polytopes circumscribed about $K$ (with a restricted number of facets) in the volume and mean width cases, again in both deterministic and probabilistic frameworks. The proofs use tools from asymptotic quantization theory together with the curvature-based optimal vertex distributions.

By encoding reasoning traces and applying information-theoretic incompressibility arguments, we establish fundamental bounds linking depth to the descriptive complexity of queries. For frequently asked, information-rich queries, the minimal description length grows proportionally to depth times the logarithm of the knowledge base size. This leads to a practical storage-computation tradeoff: queries accessed beyond a critical threshold become cheaper to cache than recompute.

    "abstract": "We investigate a diffusion equation that incorporates historical effects, in which the memory-delay mechanism is represented by a nonnegative Borel measure $\u03bc$ on the interval $(0, \\mathfrak T]$. The diffusion component is characterised by a coercive bilinear form $a_0$, while the historical term is modelled as a measure-induced convolution operator $\\mathcal K_\u03bc$, derived from a bounded non-negative form $a_1$. This framework includes the memory-free parabolic problem ($\u03bc=0$), distributed-memory Volterra models ($d\u03bc(s)=k(s)\\,ds$), discrete-delay models with atomic measures, and mixed kernels. For general finite measures $\u03bc$, we establish well-posedness over finite time horizons and derive stability bounds that remain applicable in the presence of delays. Subsequently, we identify a positive-type condition under which the memory term is dissipative, leading to a refined energy inequality. For absolutely continuous kernels, we provide verifiable sufficient conditions, including complete monotonicity, and an internal-variable representation that elucidates the decay mechanism.",

The main novelty lies in incorporating Glauber dynamics, allowing for particle creation and annihilation with birth-death rates depending locally on the particle configuration. In the macroscopic limit, the particle density evolves according to a nonlinear reaction--diffusion equation, where the reaction term is explicitly determined by the microscopic rates. The key new ingredient is a replacement lemma adapted to the fractal geometry of the Sierpi\u0144ski gasket.

In particular, setting an appropriate topology for the infinite-dimensional space to show invariance and apply the fixed point argument is not easy. To overcome this difficulty, we use fixed point theorem for geodesically convex spaces constructed by optimal transportation. Specifically, from the disintegration with respect to stationary variable, we define a metric using the Wasserstein-$2$ distance over one-dimensional space, which yields a $CAT(0)$ space. In this topology, we construct an invariance set of probability measures and prove the existence of the periodic measure-valued solution from Schauder's fixed point theorem on geodesically convex spaces.

Writing $Y_{i,k} = f_k(X_i)-\u03bc_k$ for the centered increment and $S_{n,k} = \\sum_{i=1}^n Y_{i,k}$ for the centered cumulative score, the expected maximum satisfies $0\\le\\mathbb E\\bigl[\\max_k S_{n,k}\\bigr] = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\mathbb E\\bigl[\\varphi_K(S_{i-1})\\bigr]$ where $\\varphi_K(u) = \\mathbb{E}\\bigl[\\max_k(u_k + Y_k)\\bigr] - \\max_k u_k$, $u\\in \\mathbb R^K$, is the selection premium function.

This letter focuses on the application of pinching antennas to multi-cell interference management and demonstrates that the use of multi-cell pinching-antenna transmission leads to a quiet wireless world. In particular, each transceiver pair can be positioned in close proximity, and hence the users' QoS requirements can be met with only low transmit power, i.e., via ``whispering\" rather than high-power transmission.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a new multiphysics finite element method for a nonlinear poroelastic model with Hencky-Mises stress tensor. By introducing some new notations, we reformulate the original model into a fluid-fluid coupling problem, which is viewed as a generalized nonlinear Stokes sub-problem combined with a reaction-diffusion sub-problem. Then, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the weak solution for the reformulated problem, and propose a stable, fully discrete multiphysics finite element method which employs Lagrangian finite element pairs for spatial discretization and a backward Euler scheme for temporal discretization. By ensuring the parameters $\u03ba_1$ and $\u03ba_3$ remain bounded and non-zero even as $\u03bb$ tends to infinity, the proposed method maintains stability for a wide range of Lagrangian element pairs. Based on the continuity and monotonicity of the nonlinear term $\\mathcal{N}(\\varepsilon(\\mathbf{u}_h^{n}))$, we give the stability analysis and derive optimal error estimates for the displacement vector $\\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure $p$ in both $L^2$-norm and $H^1$-norm. In particular, the $L^2$-norm error estimate for the displacement $\\mathbf{u}$, which was not present in previous literature, is established here through an auxiliary problem and a Poincar$\\acute{e}$ inequality. Also, we present numerical tests to verify the theoretical analysis, and the results confirm the optimal convergence rates. Finally, we draw conclusions to summarize the work.",

    "abstract": "The recent hardware trend towards reduced precision computing has reignited the interest in numerical techniques that can be used to enhance the accuracy of floating point operations beyond what is natively supported for basic arithmetic operations on the hardware. In this work, we study the behavior of various compensated summation techniques, which can be used to enhance the accuracy for the summation operation, particularly in situations when the addends are not known a priori. Complete descriptions of the error behavior are provided for these techniques. In particular, the relationship between the intermediate results at two consecutive summing steps is provided, which is used to identify the operation that limits accuracy and guide the design of more nuanced techniques. The analysis relies on the work of Dekker [Numerische Mathematik, 1971], which uses a special floating point number system that does not require uniqueness in the number representation. Despite this seemingly strange attribute, Dekker's system is very convenient for the analysis here and allows general statements to be expressed succinctly compared to a number system that requires uniqueness. To prepare the foundation for discussion, we start by giving a thorough exhibition of Dekker's number system and supply the details that were omitted in Dekker [Numerische Mathematik, 1971]. Numerical examples are designed to explain the inner workings of these compensated summation techniques, illustrate their efficacy, and empirically verify the analytical results derived. Discussions are also given on application scenarios where these techniques can be beneficial.",

We further construct two Calabi-Yau threefolds whose third cohomology decomposes, via complex multiplication, into complementary two-dimensional Hodge structures of types (1,0,1,0) and (0,1,0,1).

Our main focus is on subdiagrams of generalized Bratteli diagrams and the problem of extending tail invariant probability measures from vertex and edge subdiagrams to the ambient diagram. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the finiteness of such extensions, formulated in terms of incidence matrices and associated stochastic matrices. Several classes of generalized Bratteli diagrams and their subdiagrams are analyzed in detail, including simple, stationary, and bounded size diagrams. We develop constructive, step-by-step procedures for measure extension and for approximating invariant measures by measures supported on suitable subdiagrams. In addition, we provide explicit examples of generalized Bratteli diagrams that admit no probability tail invariant measures, a phenomenon absent for standard Bratteli diagrams with finite vertex sets. Finally, we address convergence questions for sequences of invariant measures arising from approximations by subdiagrams, clarifying the relationship between combinatorial structure and measure-theoretic behavior.",

We call this class of unitary operators, the {\\em conjugate orbit }of $U$ and denote it by $\\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$. We will see that $U^{*}$, the Hilbert space adjoint of $U$, always belongs to $\\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$, while $U$ belongs to $\\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$ only when $U$ is unitarily equivalent to $U^{*}$, making $U$ a member of $\\mathfrak{O}_c(U)$ an uncommon event. We completely describe the conjugate orbit of the classical bilateral shift and discuss when a unitary multiplication operator on the classical Lebesgue space of the unit circle belongs to this conjugate orbit. We also broaden this discussion to include the bilateral shifts of higher multiplicity which, via unitary equivalence, makes connections to other interesting unitary operators such as the translation and dilation operators on the Lebesgue space of the real line. Finite unitary matrices provide us with a rich source of examples of conjugate unitary orbits to discuss. In particular, we determine which diagonal matrices, if any, belong to the conjugate orbit of a fixed unitary matrix. Closely related to the finite unitary matrices are the diagonalizable unitary operators with respect to some, possibly infinite, orthonormal basis. We give a large class of variations of these unitary operators that belong to the conjugate orbit and establish a connection to the classical Fourier--Plancherel and Hilbert transforms. Finally, we develop a model for a unitary operator using real Hilbert spaces and use it to describe the conjugate orbit as well as revisit some of our previous discussions in another light.",

    "abstract": "We discuss germs of distributions on $d-$dimensional smooth Riemannian manifolds and, in particular, we derive \\emph{multi-level Schauder estimates} without making any further assumptions on the underlying geometry. As a preliminary step, we define the notions of coherence and homogeneity for germs of distributions on open subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^d$, $d \\ge 1$. Subsequently, we formulate both the reconstruction theorem, cf., [CZ20], and the Schauder estimates, cf., [BCZ24], in this setting. Leveraging the properties of the exponential map, we extend these results to Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, we devise a counterpart of the reconstruction theorem previously established in the literature [RS21], while additionally proving the regularity of the reconstructed distribution in suitable H\u00f6lder-Zygmund spaces. Finally, by introducing a novel concept of $\u03b2$-regularizing kernels on Riemannian manifolds, we establish Schauder estimates for coherent and homogeneous germs in this context.",

    "abstract": "Assessing whether two datasets are distributionally consistent has become a central theme in modern scientific analysis, particularly as generative artificial intelligence is increasingly used to produce synthetic datasets whose fidelity must be rigorously validated against the original data on which they are trained, a task made more challenging by the continued growth in data volume and problem dimensionality. In this work, we propose the use of arithmetic coding to provide a lossless and invertible compression of datasets under a physics-informed probabilistic representation. Datasets that share the same underlying physical correlations admit comparable optimal descriptions, while discrepancies in those correlations-arising from miscalibration, mismodeling, or bias-manifest as an irreducible excess in code length. This excess codelength defines an operational fidelity metric, quantified directly in bits through differences in achievable compression length relative to a physics-inspired reference distribution. We demonstrate that this metric is global, interpretable, additive across components, and asymptotically optimal in the Shannon sense. Moreover, we show that differences in codelength correspond to differences in expected negative log-likelihood evaluated under the same physics-informed reference model. As a byproduct, we also demonstrate that our compression approach achieves a higher compression ratio than traditional general-purpose algorithms such as gzip. Our results establish lossless, physics-aware compression based on arithmetic coding not as an end in itself, but as a measurement instrument for testing the fidelity between datasets.",

To do this, we focus on linear dynamical systems that are compatible with a given network, and consider policies that switch periodically between the given one and an alternative, topologically-compatible dynamics. In particular, we seek to solve design problems aimed at finding a) the optimal switching schedule between two preselected topologies, and b) an optimal topology and optimal switching schedule. By imposing periodicity, we first provide a metric of resilience in terms of the spectral abscissa of the averaged linear time-invariant dynamics. By restricting our policies to commutative networks, we then show how the optimal scheduling problem reduces to a convex optimization, providing a bound on the net resilience that can be achieved. After this, we find that the optimal, sparse commutative network to switch with is fully disconnected and allocates the spectral sum among the nodes of the network equally. We then impose additional restrictions on topology edge selection, which leads to a biconvex optimization for which certain matrix rank conditions guide the choice of weighting parameters to obtain desirable solutions. Finally, we provide two methods to solve this problem efficiently (based on a McCormick relaxation, and alternating minimization), and illustrate the results in simulations.",

    "title": "Smoothing-Enabled Randomized Stochastic Gradient Schemes for Solving Nonconvex Nonsmooth Potential Games under Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "The state of the art in solving nonconvex nonsmooth games under uncertainty remains in its infancy. Existing studies primarily rely on stringent growth conditions or local convexity-like properties, making the development of alternative algorithms desirable. In this work, we study a class of stochastic $N$-player noncooperative games characterized by a potential function. We first consider the nonconvex smooth setting and develop a randomized stochastic gradient (RSG) scheme. The RSG scheme achieves the optimal sample complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(N^{2}\u03b5^{-4})$ for reaching a point whose expected residual has norm at most $\u03b5$. Building on this result, we introduce a randomized smoothed RSG (RS-RSG) scheme for solving stochastic potential games afflicted by nonconvexity and nonsmoothness. We show that RS-RSG asymptotically converges to an equilibrium of the smoothed game with sample complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^{4}_{\\max}n^{3/2}_{\\max}N^{3}\u03b7^{-1}\u03b5^{-4})$, where $\u03b7>0$ is the smoothing parameter. Under Lipschitz continuity of the Clarke subdifferentials, we show that the expected residual evaluated at the smoothed equilibrium is $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b7^{2})$. In addition, we discuss the biased RSG and RS-RSG variants and demonstrate the effectiveness of the biased RS-RSG scheme on a class of stochastic potential hierarchical games where the exact lower-level solution is unavailable in finite time. Collectively, our results provide a new pathway that goes beyond classical conditions for solving stochastic nonconvex nonsmooth games. Some preliminary numerics are also provided.",

The output automatically satisfies the conservative complex Burgers equation $\u03bb_x+\u03bb\u03bb_y=0$.\n  Our main result is that holomorphicity of the seed $f$ is necessary, not merely sufficient, for rigidity: any $C^1$ function whose implicit solution satisfies $\u03bb_x+\u03bb\u03bb_y=0$ must be holomorphic. This closes a gap in the existing literature and identifies $\\operatorname{Hol}(U,\\mathbb{C}^+)$ as the maximal seed space compatible with rigidity.

On the torus $\\mathbb{T}$, this reduces the curvature bound to a generalized eigenvalue problem. For the Cauchy process ($\u03b3= 1$), the curvature spectrum consists of the odd integers, yielding the global bound $CD(1, \\infty)$.

It is crucial to determine when $S$ supports an ideal $\\mathcal{D}$-type circle pattern $\\mathcal{P}$ with the exterior intersection angles given by $\u03a6$. Rivin, Bobenko-Springborn and Ge-Hua-Zhou provided perfect solutions and gave wonderful criteria for the existence and uniqueness of ideal circle patterns. However, all criteria established by Rivin, Bobenko-Springborn and Ge-Hua-Zhou are extremely difficult to verify for the given cellular decomposition $\\mathcal{D}$ and the weight $\u03a6$. In this paper, we introduce the character $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{D},\u03a6)$ depends only on the data of the weighted cellular decomposition $(\\mathcal D, \u03a6)$ on $S$, and give some quite simple criteria for the existence of ideal circle patterns realizing $(\\mathcal{D},\u03a6)$. It seems that our character-type criteria are the first conditions totally different from criteria of Rivin, Bobenko-Springborn and Ge-Hua-Zhou, and provide more easily verifiable criteria. Our new character-type theorems may be of some independent interest. As an application, we give a new descriptions of the curvature image set $\\mathbf{K}(\\mathbb{R}^N_{>0})$.

Using this formula, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the monogeneity of $f(x)$, expressed in terms of the prime divisors of $a$ and $c$ and the parameters $k,m,n$. This yields infinite families of monogenic polynomials of arbitrary degree, including families with a non-square-free discriminant. Building on these results, we extend our algebraic characterization to composite polynomials, establishing some explicit conditions for the monogeneity of the composition of $f(x)$ with an arbitrary polynomial $g(x)$. From an analytic point of view, we derive asymptotic estimates for the number of monogenic polynomials in these families under natural assumptions. We further study non-monogeneity via the field index $i(K)$ and, for each prime $p$, provide sufficient conditions ensuring $\u03bd_p(i(K))=1$, yielding partial progress toward a problem of Narkiewicz. We also highlight a connection with a class of differential equations naturally associated with $f(x)$.

More precisely, for $F$ a field of characteristic $2$ and a central simple algebra $A$ of exponent 2 that splits over a triquadratic extension of $F$ of separability degree at least 4, we attach a cohomological invariant $\\inv(A) \\in H_2^3(F) / G$, where $H_2^3(F)$ is the third Kato-Milno cohomology group and $G$ is a subgroup of $H_2^3(F)$ divisible by the Brauer class of $A$. As an application, we will relate the decomposability of the algebra in degree 8 to the vanishing of $\\inv(A)$. Moreover, we will use this invariant to prove some descent results for central simple algebras and quadratic forms over biquadratic extensions.",

    "abstract": "We study the possibility of a gradual improvement as time progresses of the regularity of solutions to evolution problems of parabolic type driven by L\u00e9vy operators, not necessarily translation invariant. In the course of our analysis we study the equivalence between general smoothing effects and a family of logarithmic Sobolev inequalities. This equivalence allows us to identify a new type of regularization, strong hypercontractivity, characterized by the existence of a time at which solutions belong to every $L^p$ space with $p$ finite. It can also be used to prove logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in a context not previously seen in the literature. We then show that any purely nonlocal L\u00e9vy operator whose kernel is comparable to that of $\\log(I-\u0394)$ is strongly hypercontractive, but fails to be supercontractive and, consequently, also fails to be ultracontractive. Finally, in the translation-invariant case, we also prove that solutions get bounded eventually.",

The source is modeled as a centered, complex-valued, microlocally isotropic generalized Gaussian random field whose covariance and relation operators are described by classical pseudo-differential operators. For sufficiently large wavenumbers, we first establish the well-posedness of the direct problem in the distributional sense by analyzing the corresponding Lippmann--Schwinger integral equation. For the inverse problem, we show that the principal symbols of both the covariance and relation operators can be uniquely determined, with probability one, from the far-field patterns generated by a single realization of the random source. The approach employs a combination of the Born linearization, asymptotic expansions of the fractional Helmholtz Green kernel at high wavenumbers, and microlocal analysis of associated Fourier integral operators.",

Being simultaneously the (traces of) values of a modular function ($j$-invariant) and Fourier coefficients of modular forms - which constitutes Zagier's duality - these integers are quite interesting. Since then, a substantial amount of research was devoted to various properties of these numbers, congruences in particular. We present an alternative point of view on these congruences, specifically, we view them as congruences between certain weight $3/2$ modular forms under repeated action of $U$-operator. That allows us to obtain a general result which includes some previously known results as special cases. Our approach is especially effective when the prime modulus is relatively small. In these cases, we obtain explanations for certain numerical observations and quantification of some previously known qualitative results. As an application, we obtain modulo $11$ congruences between the traces of singular moduli and class numbers of quadratic fields in the case when the twisted central special value of the $L$-function associated with the elliptic curve of conductor $11$ vanishes.",

    "abstract": "Microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising architecture for implementing linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing in the analog domain, with radio frequency (RF) signals. Existing studies on MiLAC-aided communications rely on idealized channel models and neglect antenna mutual coupling. However, since MiLAC performs processing at RF, mutual coupling becomes critical and alters the implemented operation, not only the channel characteristics. In this paper, we develop a physics-compliant model for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems accounting for mutual coupling with multiport network theory. We derive end-to-end system models for scenarios with MiLACs at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, showing how mutual coupling impacts the linear transformation implemented by the MiLACs. Furthermore, we formulate and solve a mutual coupling aware MiLAC optimization problem, deriving a closed-form globally optimal solution that maximizes the received signal power. We establish the fundamental performance limits of MiLAC with mutual coupling, and derive three analytical results. First, mutual coupling is beneficial in MiLAC-aided systems, on average. Second, with mutual coupling, MiLAC performs as digital architectures equipped with a matching network, while having fewer RF chains. Third, with mutual coupling, MiLAC always outperforms digital architectures with no matching network. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings.",

Machines deteriorate according to stochastic processes and incur increasing costs as they approach complete failure. The times needed for repairs to be performed, and the amounts of time needed for the repairer to switch between different machines, are random and machine-dependent. The problem is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP) in which the objective is to minimize long-run average costs. We prove the equivalence of an alternative formulation based on rewards and use this to develop an index heuristic policy, which is shown to be optimal in certain special cases. We then use rollout-based reinforcement learning techniques to develop a novel online policy improvement (OPI) approach, which uses the index heuristic as a base policy and also as an insurance option at decision epochs where the best action cannot be selected with sufficient confidence. Results from extensive numerical experiments, involving randomly-generated network layouts and parameter values, show that the OPI heuristic is able to achieve close-to-optimal performance in fast-changing systems with state transitions occurring 100 times per second, suggesting that it is suitable for online implementation.",

In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework for rational maps between multigraded Proj schemes by introducing several notions of maps between their underlying multigraded rings. A key challenge is that to induce actual morphisms (rather than just rational maps), the ring homomorphism $\\varphi\\colon R \\to S$ must hit every relevant element in $S$. To address this, we introduce the use of relevant subsets $B \\subseteq S_+$ (where $S_+$ is the ideal generated by all relevant elements), $B \\unlhd S$, which allow us to control this condition more flexibly.\n  As an application, we show that multigraded noetherian polynomial rings naturally encode combinatorial data, giving rise to systems of fans and thus to toric prevarieties. By leveraging our notion of rational maps with those relevant subsets, we prove that the category of triples $(D, S, B)$ - where $D$ is a finitely generated abelian group, $S$ is a $D$-graded noetherian polynomial ring, and $B \\unlhd S$ is a subset of $S_+$ - together with rational maps of conical rings, is anti-equivalent to the category of simplicial toric prevarieties.",

In particular, for the drifted Poisson case, we obtain an explicit representation of the inverse Laplace exponent using the Lambert W function, which yields an analytic expression for the Laplace transform of the first-passage time. Furthermore, when the jump sizes follow exponential and Gamma distributions, we derive explicit formulas for the mean and variance of the reorder times, thereby clarifying the moment structure of first-passage times for generalized L\u00e9vy demand processes.\n  From an operations research perspective, we explicitly characterize the expected total cost over a finite time horizon based on the distribution of cumulative demand.

    "abstract": "In this article, we derive a sharp mixing time estimate of the Glauber dynamics for the Curie-Weiss-Potts model in the low-temperature regime. In contrast to the high-temperature regime studied by Cuff et al. (J. Stat. Phys. 149: 432-477, 2012), in which the Gibbs measure is concentrated around the equiproportional distribution of spins, the Gibbs measure in the low-temperature regime is concentrated on multiple states, each with a dominant number of a single spin. Consequently, global mixing of the system requires sufficiently many transitions between these states. Since these transitions are well explained by the phenomenon of metastability, the theory of metastability plays a central role in the analysis of slow mixing. In particular, the sharp asymptotics for the mixing time is given by the mixing time of the limit Markov chain, which describes the metastable behavior of the dynamics, multiplied by the metastable transition time-scale. As a byproduct, we verify that it does not exhibit a cutoff phenomenon.",

DeVos, Goddyn and Mohar obtained the nontrivial lower bound for the size of this product set when $G$ is abelian. The DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem is a fundamental result in additive combinatorics which unifies various results from zero-sum combinatorics and has connections with subsequence sums and sumsets. In this paper, we obtain an optimal lower bound for the size of generalized product set $\u03a0^{\\ell}(\\mathcal{A})$ in torsion-free groups (not necessarily abelian), and characterize the structure of underlying sets in the sequence $\\mathcal{A} = (A_1, \\ldots, A_m)$ for which $\u03a0^{\\ell}(\\mathcal{A})$ achieves the optimal lower bound. By slightly modifying the arguments of the proofs in the case of torsion-free groups, we derive such inverse theorems in cyclic groups of prime orders also. Our proof of these result also yields a new proof of DeVos-Goddyn-Mohar Theorem in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Moreover, we extend these inverse results to arbitrary abelian groups. Furthermore, as an application, we generalize a theorem for subsequence sums due to Hamidoune in torsion-free groups, and obtain several other results for subsequence sums in arbitrary groups.",

This causes one spatial derivative loss while leads to a stronger nonlinearity, comparing to the classic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. As a result, the mathematical analysis on the compressible primitive equations is mathematically more challenging than that on the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem to the non-isentropic compressible primitive equations with only vertical diffusion for the temperature, but without gravity. Local existence and uniqueness as well as the continuous dependence on the initial data of strong solutions are established for any suitably regular initial data. The initial velocity and pressure are assumed here to be of one order derivative higher regularity than that of the initial density.",

Unlike the sample standard deviation, this estimator depends on the observation order: permuting the values can change the average moving range. We make this dependence explicit by modeling the order as an independent uniformly random permutation. A direct application of the law of total variance then decomposes its variance into a component due to ordering and a component due to the realized values. Averaging over all permutations yields a simple order-invariant baseline for the moving-range estimator: the sample Gini mean difference divided by $d_2$. Simulations quantify the resulting fraction of variance attributable to ordering under i.i.d. Normal sampling, and two NIST examples illustrate a typical ordering and an ordering with strong serial structure relative to random permutations of the same values.",

For the linear pressure splitting we show that the eigenvalues are not all of the same sign, while for the second-order pressure splitting we prove that all coefficients of the characteristic equation are positive.

While classical Lebesgue spaces ($L_{p}$) successfully measure the magnitude of functions, they frequently fail to bound linear and non-linear evolution operators at critical endpoints of $p=1$ or $p = \\infty$ because they conflate a function's amplitude with its spatial spread. To resolve this analytic bottleneck, we introduce distribution functions and decreasing rearrangements, culminating in the construction of Lorentz spaces ($L_{p, q}$). By utilizing the Complex (Riesz-Thorin) and Real (Peetre's K-functional) methods of interpolation, these highly sensitive intermediate spaces act as geometric bridges between endpoint extremes. We apply this framework to two distinct physical models: deriving the continuous smoothing decay of the parabolic Heat equation, and establishing the foundational dispersive Strichartz estimates for the hyperbolic free Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Ultimately, interpolation theory is shown to be the essential mathematical language for quantifying both thermal diffusion and quantum dispersion.",

While it is usually straightforward to obtain such a model from time series data, for instance with least-squares fitting, it is generally difficult to quantify the uncertainty associated with the prediction of the temporal evolution of the observables. This paper considers a general framework for uncertainty quantification in data-driven dynamical models by framing prediction error through the lens of inverse problem theory. Building on Koopman-inspired model identification strategies that are suited for nonlinear dynamical models, we consider a prediction as an approximate measurement from which the original input state can be faithfully recovered, and define the prediction error as the MSE of solving the inverse problem that would yield this prediction. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on both numerical models and experimental data showing that it provides a robust uncertainty measure of model performance.",

    "abstract": "We study a three-dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem describing the motion of an incompressible, viscous fluid coupled with a deformable elastic shell of Koiter type that forms part of the fluid boundary. The fluid motion is governed by the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations posed on a time-dependent domain, while the shell evolution is described by a nonlinear elastic model. At the fluid-structure interface, we impose Navier slip boundary conditions, allowing for tangential slip penalized by friction. Our main result establishes the global-in-time existence of weak solutions up to the first possible self-intersection of the shell, for arbitrarily large initial data with finite energy. The analysis is carried out in a fully three-dimensional setting and addresses the major mathematical challenges arising from the moving domain, the geometric nonlinearity of the shell, and the reduced regularization induced by the slip boundary condition. The proof relies on a careful construction of suitable approximation schemes, novel compactness arguments adapted to the slip framework, and a new extension operator for divergence-free test functions compatible with the fluid-shell coupling. As a further contribution, we provide a direct approach to the strong convergence of second-order spatial derivatives of the shell displacement, which allows us to treat nonlinear Koiter shell models within the same framework.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation wireless networks are progressing beyond conventional connectivity to incorporate emerging sensing and computing capabilities. This convergence gives rise to integrated systems that enable not only uninterrupted communication, but also environmental awareness, intelligent decision-making, and novel applications that take advantage of these combined features. At the same time, this integration brings substantial security challenges. As computing, sensing, and communication become more tightly intertwined, the overall complexity of the system increases, creating new vulnerabilities and expanding the attack surface. The widespread deployment of data-heavy artificial intelligence applications further amplifies concerns regarding data security and privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of security and privacy threats, along with potential countermeasures, in integrated wireless systems. We first review physical-layer security techniques for communication networks, and then investigate the security and privacy implications of semantic and pragmatic communications and their associated cross-layer design methodologies. For sensing functionalities, we pinpoint security and privacy risks at the levels of signal sources, propagation channels, and sensing targets, and summarize state-of-the-art defense strategies for each. The growing computational requirements of these applications drive the need for distributed computing over the network, which introduces additional risks such as data leakage, weak authentication, and multiple points of failure. We subsequently discuss secure coded computing approaches that can help overcome several of these challenges. Finally, we introduce unified security frameworks tailored to integrated communication-sensing-computing architectures, offering an end-to-end perspective on protecting future wireless systems.",

    "title": "Enormous Fluid Antenna Systems (E-FAS)--Part II: Channel Estimation",
    "abstract": "Enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS) have recently emerged as a new wireless architecture in which intelligent metasurfaces act as guided electromagnetic interfaces, enabling surface-wave (SW) propagation with much lower attenuation and more control than conventional space-wave transmission. While prior work has reported substantial power gains under perfect channel state information (CSI), the impact of practical channel acquisition on E-FAS performance remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of E-FAS-assisted downlink transmission under pilot-based channel estimation. We develop an estimation framework for the equivalent end-to-end channel and derive closed-form expressions for the statistics of the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimate and its estimation error. Building on these results, we analyze both single-user and multiuser operation while explicitly accounting for the training overhead. For the single-user case, we characterize the outage probability and achievable rate with imperfect CSI, and reveal an inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) saturation phenomenon caused by residual self-interference. For the multiuser case, we study zero-forcing (ZF) precoding based on imperfect channel estimates and show that the system becomes interference-limited in the high SNR regime because of residual inter-user interference. Furthermore, we quantify the trade-off between spatial multiplexing gains and pilot overhead when the number of users increases. Analytical findings are validated via Monte Carlo simulations and benchmarked against least-squares (LS) estimation and conventional non-E-FAS transmission. The results reveal that despite CSI imperfections and training costs, E-FAS retains substantial performance advantages and provides robustness enabled by its amplified large-scale channel gain.",

From this, we verify that a general conjecture by Sheperd-Barron and Ekedahl is valid for the Ramanujan vector field. Furthermore, we consider the affine realization of a certain moduli space of elliptic curves where the Ramanujan vector field is defined, and describe - in characteristic $p$ - the locus given by supersingular elliptic curves in two ways: a classical one - using equations for the supersingular polynomial - and a new one as the singular set of some vector fields.

    "abstract": "To measure the degree of agreement between two observers that independently classify $n$ subjects within $K$ categories, it is common to use different kappa type coefficients, the most common of which is the $\u03ba_C$ coefficient (Cohen's kappa). As $\u03ba_C$ has some weaknesses -such as its poor performance with highly unbalanced marginal distributions-, the $\u0394$ coefficient is sometimes used, based on the $delta$ response model. This model allows us to obtain other parameters like: (a) the $\u03b1_i$ contribution of each $i$ category to the value of the global agreement $\u0394=\\sum \u03b1_i$; and (b) the consistency $\\mathcal{S}_i$ in the category $i$ (degree of agreement in the category $i$), a more appropriate parameter than the kappa value obtained by collapsing the data into the category $i$. It has recently been shown that the classic estimator $\\hat\u03ba_C$ underestimates $\u03ba_C$, having obtained a new estimator $\\hat\u03ba_{CU}$ which is less biased. This article demonstrates that something similar happens to the known estimators $\\hat\u0394$, $\\hat\u03b1_i$, and $\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}_i$ of $\u0394$, $\u03b1_i$ and $\\mathcal{S}_i$ (respectively), proposes new and less biased estimators $\\hat\u0394_U$, $\\hat\u03b1_{iU}$, and $\\hat{\\mathcal{S}}_{iU}$, determines their variances, analyses the behaviour of all estimators, and concludes that the new estimators should be used when $n$ or $K$ are small (at least when $n\\leq 50$ or $K\\leq 3$). Additionally, the case where one of the raters is a gold standard is contemplated, in which situation two new parameters arise: the $conformity$ (the rater's capability to recognize a subject in the category $i$) and the $predictivity$ (the reliability of a response $i$ by the rater).",

A consequence is a structural formulation of lower kinematic pairs that clarifies system interactions.",

Such a model arises naturally in the description of viscoelastic and feedback-controlled elastic structures.

The long-time behavior of solutions is then analyzed by constructing a suitable Lyapunov functional, from which stability and energy decay results are obtained. Moreover, by applying the concavity method, we prove that solutions associated with negative initial energy blow up in finite time. These results highlight the competing effects of fractional damping and delayed feedback on the qualitative behavior of the system.

We study which partitions $\u03bb$ appear with nonzero multiplicities in the cocharacter sequence of $A$ for several classes of algebras $A$. Berele defines the eventual arm width $\u03c9_0(A)$ to be the maximal integer $d$ so that if $\u03bb$ appears with nonzero multiplicity in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, then $\u03bb$ can have at most $d$ parts arbitrarily large. Berele also shows that if $A$ is Lie nilpotent, then $\u03c9_0(A) = 1$. In the first part of this paper, we show that if $A$ is unital, then $\u03c9_0(A) = 1$ if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. To prove this statement, we show that the algebra of proper polynomials $B_n(A)$ is finite dimensional if and only if $A$ is Lie nilpotent. In the second part, we give a bound on the nonzero multiplicities $\u03bb$ in the cocharacter sequence of $A$, when the T-ideal of identities of $A$ is equal to a product of T-ideals generated by long commutators. As an application, we show that for a Lie nilpotent algebra $A$, the nonzero multiplicities $m_\u03bb(A)$ correspond to partitions $\u03bb$ which are supported in step-like diagrams in which the number of steps grows with the index of Lie nilpotency.

    "abstract": "The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used for solving large-scale semidefinite programs (SDPs), yet on instances with multiple primal--dual optimal solution pairs, it often enters prolonged slow-convergence regions where the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) residuals nearly stall. To explain and predict the fine-grained dynamical behavior inside these regions, we develop a local second-order limit dynamics framework for ADMM near an arbitrary KKT point -- not necessarily the eventual limit point of the iterates. Assuming the existence of a strictly complementary primal--dual solution pair, we derive a second-order local expansion of the ADMM dynamics by leveraging a refined and simplified variational characterization of the (parabolic) second-order directional derivative of the PSD projection operator. This expansion reveals a closed convex cone of directions along which the local first-order update vanishes, and it induces a second-order limit map that governs the persistent drift after transient effects are filtered out. We characterize fundamental properties of this mapping, including its kernel, range, and continuity. A primal--dual decoupling further yields a clean scaling law for the effect of the penalty parameter in ADMM. We connect these properties to second-order dynamical features of ADMM, including fixed points, almost-invariant sets, and microscopic phases. Three empirical phenomena in slow-convergence regions are then explained or predicted: (i) angles between consecutive iterate differences are small yet nonzero, except for sparse spikes; (ii) primal and dual infeasibilities are insensitive to penalty-parameter updates; and (iii) iterates can be transiently trapped in a low-dimensional subspace for an extended period. Extensive numerical experiments on the Mittelmann dataset corroborate our theoretical predictions.",

Positive answers are known for computably enumerable many-one degrees (Degtev) and, more recently, for many-one degrees admitting a $\u0394^0_2$ representative (Batyrshin). In this note we isolate a rigidity principle behind these phenomena.\n  Call a set $A\\subseteq\u03c9$ \\emph{$m$-rigid} if every total computable $m$-autoreduction of $A$ is eventually the identity. We prove that if $A$ is $m$-rigid, then its many-one degree $\u00b0_m(A)$ contains an infinite antichain of $1$-degrees. The proof uses a uniform duplication construction: for each computable parameter $S$ we define $B_S\\equiv_m A$ so that any injective reduction $B_S\\le_1 B_T$ induces an $m$-autoreduction of $A$ and therefore forces $S\\subseteq^{*}T$. Choosing an almost-inclusion infinite antichain of computable sets yields the desired infinite $1$-antichain inside $\u00b0_m(A)$.\n  As applications, Jockusch's rigidity theorem implies that every $1$-generic set is $m$-rigid, giving a comeager family of positive instances. Moreover, $m$-rigidity holds with Lebesgue measure $1$ (indeed, every Martin-L\u00f6f random real is $m$-rigid). Consequently, Odifreddi's Question~5 has a positive answer \\emph{with probability $1$} for a fair-coin random $A\\in 2^\u03c9$; any counterexample (if it exists) is confined to a null set (and, by genericity, also to a meager set).",

The proofs rely on comparing the ranks of $\\ell$-adic algebraic monodromy groups in higher degrees to those in degree $2$ via the theory of Frobenius tori and the Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky Lie algebra.",

    "title": "New minimal surfaces in the sphere from capillary minimal cones",
    "abstract": "For every $p,q\\geq 1$, we construct minimal embeddings of $\\mathbb{S}^p \\times \\mathbb{S}^q \\times \\mathbb{S}^1$ in $\\mathbb{S}^{p + q + 2}$ by doubling the links of free-boundary minimal cones in $\\mathbb{R}^{p+q+3}$ with bi-orthogonal symmetry. This solves problems posed by Hsiang-Lawson and Hsiang-Hsiang. The equivariance reduces the minimal surface equation to an ODE, and we prove the existence of capillary minimal cones for every contact angle. We obtain free-boundary solutions as limits of capillary surfaces via a singular shooting problem with infinite initial slope. As the contact angle degenerates to $0$, rescalings of the capillary cones converge to a homogeneous solution of the one-phase Bernoulli problem, further illustrating the connection between one-phase free boundaries and minimal surfaces through the capillary functional.",
