    "title": "Optimal Tree-Decompositions with Bags of Bounded Treewidth",
    "abstract": "We prove that several natural graph classes have tree-decompositions with minimum width such that each bag has bounded treewidth. For example, every planar graph has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth at most 3. This treewidth bound is best possible. More generally, every graph of Euler genus $g$ has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth in $O(g)$. This treewidth bound is best possible. Most generally, every $K_p$-minor-free graph has a tree-decomposition with minimum width such that each bag has treewidth at most some polynomial function $f(p)$.\n  In such results, the assumption of an excluded minor is justified, since we show that analogous results do not hold for the class of 1-planar graphs, which is one of the simplest non-minor-closed monotone classes. In fact, we show that 1-planar graphs do not have tree-decompositions with width within an additive constant of optimal, and with bags of bounded treewidth. On the other hand, we show that 1-planar $n$-vertex graphs have tree-decompositions with width $O(\\sqrt{n})$ (which is the asymptotically tight bound) and with bounded treewidth bags. Moreover, this result holds in the more general setting of bounded layered treewidth, where the union of a bounded number of bags has bounded treewidth.",

    "title": "Constructions of block MDS LDPC codes from punctured circulant matrices",
    "abstract": "Low density parity check (LDPC) codes, initially discovered by Gallager, exhibit excellent performance in iterative decoding, approaching the Shannon limit. MDS array codes, with favorable algebraic structures, are codes suitable for decoding large burst errors. The Blaum-Roth (BR) code, an MDS array code similar to the Reed-Solomon (RS) code but has a parity-check matrix prone to $4$-cycles. Fossorier proposed constructing quasi-cyclic LDPC codes from circulant permutation matrices but are not MDS array codes. This paper aims to construct codes that possess both the block MDS property and have no $4$-cycles in the Tanner graph of their parity-check matrices, namely the so-called block MDS LDPC codes. Non-binary block MDS QC codes were first constructed by [Tauz {\\it et al. }IEEE ITW, 2025] using circulant shift matrices. We first generate a family of block MDS codes over $\\F_2$ from punctured circulant permutation matrices. Second, we construct a family of block MDS LDPC codes from circulant matrices with column weight $> 1$ (CM$(t)$). Additionally, we present the Moore determinant formula for CM$(t)$s and a sufficient condition to avoid $4$-cycles in CM\\((t)\\)-QC LDPC codes' Tanner graphs for $t> 1$. We also point out the non-existence of binary block MDS CPM-QC LDPC codes. Compared to the codes constructed in [Li {\\it et al. }IEEE TIT, 2023] and [Xiao {\\it et al. }IEEE TCOM, 2021], our block MDS LDPC codes show enhanced random-error-correction at a similar code length and rate. Meanwhile, these codes can effectively combat burst errors when considered as array codes. Both of our two types of constructions for block MDS LDPC codes are applicable to the scenario of the binary field.",

    "title": "A nonmonotone extrapolated proximal gradient-subgradient algorithm beyond global Lipschitz gradient continuity",
    "abstract": "With the advancement of modern applications, an increasing number of composite optimization problems arise whose smooth component does not possess a globally Lipschitz continuous gradient. This setting prevents the direct use of the proximal gradient (PG) method and its variants, and has motivated a growing body of research on new PG-type methods and their convergence theory, in particular, global convergence analysis without imposing any explicit or implicit boundedness assumptions on the iterates. Until recently, the first complete analysis of this kind has been established for the PG method and its specific nonmonotone variants, which has since stimulated further exploration along this research direction. In this paper, we consider a general composite optimization model beyond the global Lipschitz gradient continuity setting. We propose a novel problem-parameter-free algorithm that incorporates a carefully designed nonmonotone line search to handle the non-global Lipschitz gradient continuity, together with an extrapolation step to achieve potential acceleration. Despite the added technical challenges introduced by combining extrapolation with nonmonotone line search, we establish a refined convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm under the Kurdyka-\u0141 ojasiewicz property, without requiring any boundedness assumptions on the iterates. This work thus further advances the theoretical understanding of PG-type methods in the non-global Lipschitz gradient continuity setting. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and highlight the advantages of integrating extrapolation with a nonmonotone line search.",

The proposed method incorporates vorticity stabilization to ensure optimal-order convergence of the velocity error, especially for convection-dominated cases. As a crucial component of the analysis, exact de Rham and finite element complexes provide a framework whose utility includes establishing velocity error estimates independent of the discrete inf-sup constant. As a representative example, Stenberg finite elements demonstrate the framework's validity and offer several computational advantages: pressure robustness, fewer degrees of freedom than classical RT or BDM elements due to vertex continuity, and convergence without requiring the commuting diagram property. Moreover, the proposed methodology is applicable to a class of finite element pairs that violate the commuting diagram property, thereby offering new possibilities for efficient discretizations of incompressible fluid problems, particularly in high Reynolds number regimes.",

However, when integrated over Gendulphe's regularised moduli space, on which the systole of 1-sided geodesics is bounded below by $\u03b5\\in\\mathbb{R}_{>0}$, it returns a finite value. Using Norbury's extension of the Mirzakhani--McShane identities to non-orientable surfaces, we derive an explicit formula for the volume of the moduli space of one-bordered Klein bottles, as well as a recursion for arbitrary topologies that fully captures the dependence on Gendulphe's regularisation parameter $\u03b5$. We further relate these results to refined topological recursion, showing that, for a fixed refinement parameter, the volumes of moduli spaces of Klein surfaces with Euler characteristic $-1$ are governed by this procedure, and we conjecture the same holds for general topologies.",

The tangent cone to low-rank sets is widely studied and underpins a range of geometric methods. The second-order geometry, which encodes curvature information, is more intricate. In this work, we develop a unified framework to derive explicit formulas for both first- and second-order tangent sets to various low-rank sets, including low-rank matrices, tensors, symmetric matrices, and positive semidefinite matrices. The framework also accommodates the intersection of a low-rank set and another set satisfying mild assumptions, thereby yielding a tangent intersection rule. Through the lens of tangent sets, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which a nonsmooth problem and its smooth parameterization share equivalent second-order stationary points. Moreover, we exploit tangent sets to characterize optimality conditions for low-rank optimization and prove that verifying second-order optimality is NP-hard. In a separate line of analysis, we investigate variational geometry of the graph of the normal cone to matrix varieties, deriving the explicit Bouligand tangent cone, Fr\u00e9chet and Mordukhovich normal cones to the graph.

    "abstract": "In this note, we propose a generalisation of G. Janelidze's notion of an ideally exact category beyond the Barr exact setting. We define an ideally regular category as a regular, Bourn protomodular category with finite coproducts in which the unique morphism 0 -> 1 is effective for descent. As in the ideally exact case, ideally regular categories support a notion of ideal that classifies regular quotients. Moreover, they admit a characterisation in terms of monadicity over a homological category (rather than a semi-abelian one, as in the exact setting). Examples include Bourn protomodular quasivarieties of universal algebra in which 0 -> 1 is effective for descent (such as the category of torsion-free unital rings), all Bourn protomodular topological varieties with at least one constant (such as topological rings), and all semi-localisations of ideally exact categories.",

    "abstract": "Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often struggle with multi-scale PDEs featuring sharp gradients and nontrivial boundary conditions, as the physics residual and boundary enforcement compete during optimization. We present a dual-network framework that decomposes the solution as $u = u_{\\text{D}} + u_{\\text{B}}$, where $u_{\\text{D}}$ (domain network) captures interior dynamics and $u_{\\text{B}}$ (boundary network) handles near-boundary corrections. Both networks share a unified physics residual while being softly specialized via distance-weighted priors ($w_{\\text{bd}} = \\exp(-d/\u03c4)$) that are cosine-annealed during training. Boundary conditions are enforced through an augmented Lagrangian method, eliminating manual penalty tuning. Training proceeds in two phases: Phase~1 uses uniform collocation to establish network roles and stabilize boundary satisfaction; Phase~2 employs focused sampling (e.g. ring sampling near $\\partial\u03a9$) with annealed role weights to efficiently resolve localized features. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks, including the 1D Fokker-Planck equation, the Laplace equation, the Poisson equation, and the 1D wave equation. Across Laplace and Poisson benchmarks, our method reduces error by $36-90\\%$, improves boundary satisfaction by $21-88\\%$, and decreases MAE by $2.2-9.3\\times$ relative to a single-network PINN. Ablations isolate contributions of (i)~soft boundary-interior specialization, (ii)~annealed role regularization, and (iii)~the two-phase curriculum. The method is simple to implement, adds minimal computational overhead, and broadly applies to PDEs with sharp solutions and complex boundary data.",

    "title": "Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers to apply the required multiplication privately from any $T$ servers. The goal is to reduce the number of servers needed to perform the required matrix multiplication. In the quantum setting, we allow the servers to share an entangled state and respond over quantum channels. Upon receiving the qudits, the user applies measurements to obtain the required multiplication. There are two main regimes in the PDMM literature: The high-privacy regime and the low-privacy regime where $T$ is less than $K$ and $L$.\n  First, in the high-privacy regime, the state-of-the-art classical code is called the gap additive secure polynomial (GASP) code. We define a feasibility requirement in the quantum setting for the GASP code such that the highest performance is achieved when it is satisfied. When it is not satisfied, we address two main concerns. The first is to find a relation between the minimum privacy requirement and the dimensions of the two matrices needed for the feasibility condition to be satisfied. Second, we develop a new family of codes that can work in the quantum setting.\n  Second, since GASP does not work efficiently in the low-privacy regimes compared to cyclic-addition degree tables (CAT) and discretely optimized GASP (DOG), we show that the feasibility condition developed for GASP can be adopted for both CAT and DOG codes as well. In addition, we propose another set of codes that can be used in the low privacy regime in the quantum setting when the feasibility requirement is not satisfied.",

To this end, we revisit the parametrization of hyperbolic structures on a one-holed torus and introduce a simple polygonal model that makes both length and twist parameters transparent. Gluing two such polygons leads to the notion of bow-tie representations of a genus-2 surface group. We prove that bow-tie representations account for most holonomies of branched hyperbolic structures, though not all: for example, Le Fils' pentagon representations form a real codimension-2 family of holonomies lying outside the bow-tie locus.",

Preserving these conservation and dissipation laws on discretisation in time can yield vastly better approximations for the same computational effort, compared to schemes that are not structure-preserving. In this work we present two novel contributions: (i) an arbitrary-order time discretisation for general conservative ordinary differential equations that conserves all known invariants and (ii) an energy-conserving and entropy-dissipating scheme for both ordinary and partial differential equations written in the GENERIC format, a superset of Poisson and gradient-descent systems. In both cases the underlying strategy is the same: the systematic introduction of auxiliary variables, allowing for the replication at the discrete level of the proofs of conservation or dissipation. We illustrate the advantages of our approximations with numerical examples of the Kepler and Kovalevskaya problems, a combustion engine model, and the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation.",

The proof proceeds in five steps. (1) We give a C*-algebraic proof of a corollary of Carath\u00e9odory-Fej\u00e9r's 1911 structure Theorem for Toeplitz matrices: if $T \\in M_n(\\mathbb{C})$ is a Hermitian, positive semidefinite Toeplitz matrix of rank $n - 1$, and $\u03be\\in \\ker T$, then the polynomial $P(z) = \\sum \u03be_j z^j$ has all its zeros on the unit circle. (2) We formulate and prove a continuous analogue of this result, replacing the Toeplitz matrix with a convolution operator with continuous kernel $h(x - y)$, and the polynomial $P(z)$ with the Fourier transform of the eigenfunction corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. (3) We analyze finite-dimensional truncations of the quadratic forms defined by real, even distributions $\\mathcal{D}$ on $[-L, L]$, and observe that the resulting matrices exhibit a structure previously encountered in perturbative expansions of the spectral action. (4) We establish an analogue of Carath\u00e9odory-Fej\u00e9r's corollary for matrices of this specific structure, thereby extending the zero localization result beyond the classical Toeplitz setting. (5) Finally, we apply a classical theorem of Hurwitz concerning the zeros of uniform limits of holomorphic functions to deduce the general result stated above.",

Johnstone, following a question by A. Carboni and a suggestion by F. W. Lawvere, and it plays a central role in the characterization of naturally Mal'tsev categories. A broad and conceptually rich generalization emerges when the condition is formulated relative to a chosen class of spans. In this setting, the familiar Mal'tsev situation is recovered when the class consists of internal relations (that is, jointly monic spans) in which case the condition states that every internal reflexive relation is an equivalence relation. The purpose of this paper is to establish a comprehensive equivalence theorem that unifies the various categorical and diagrammatic formulations of the relative Lawvere condition. Furthermore, this formulation retains its significance even beyond the context of categories with finite limits, extending, for example, to categories admitting pullbacks of split epimorphisms along split epimorphisms. In addition to providing a fresh perspective on previously established results, we present a new characterization involving Janelidze-Pedicchio pseudogroupoids.",

We give an alternative way how to calculate the inner products of functions from this system and discuss the spectral properties of the Gram matrix generated by this system. The univariate system was later generalized to the multivariate setting by two of the authors of this work. Instead of the usual tensor product construction, this generalization relied on the inner products inside of the argument of the univariate sequence. It turned out that such a system forms a Riesz basis of $L_2(0,1)^n$ for every $n\\ge 1$ with Riesz constants independent of $n$. In this work, we investigate the properties of these new sequences of functions in $L_q(0,1)^n$ for $q\\not =2.$ First, we show that the univariate system is a Schauder basis in $L_q(0,1)$ for every $1<q<\\infty$. By a general argument, it follows that the tensor products of this system also form a Schauder basis in $L_q(0,1)^n$ for every $n\\ge 2$ and $1<q<\\infty.$ The same fact can also be shown by measuring the distance of the tensor product system to the classical multivariate Fourier basis, but - surprisingly - this argument only works for $n\\le 3$. If, on the other hand, we replace the outer tensor products by inner products directly in the argument of the univariate system, the same approach is applicable for an arbitrary dimension $n\\in{\\mathbb N}.$",

This theorem concerns one-sided Calder\u00f3n-Zygmund operators (CZOs) whose kernels $K(x,y)$ vanish whenever $x < y$. These operators are bounded on $L^2(w)$ provided that the weight $w$ belongs to the one-sided class $A_2^{\\uparrow}$. The argument reduces the norm estimate to testing on indicator functions via a two-weight testing theorem. By combining this with the weak-type $(1,1)$ estimate in the one-sided setting and an extrapolation theorem, we obtain the one-sided $A_2^{\\uparrow}$ theorem with a logarithmic loss. We develop a localized theory on fixed intervals by introducing adapted weight classes and showing that the same quantitative bound holds locally for one-sided operators.",

Anal., 63(4) (2025), pp. 1617--1641] for heterogeneous Stokes problems, while also providing several other improvements, including a better localization strategy and a more precise pressure reconstruction. The proposed method is based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition methodology and achieves optimal convergence orders under minimal structural assumptions on the coefficients. A key feature of our approach is the careful design of so-called quantities of interest, defining functionals of the solution whose values the multiscale approximation aims to reproduce exactly. Their selection is particularly delicate in the context of Stokes problems due to potential conflicts arising from the divergence-free constraint. We prove the exponential decay of the problem-adapted basis functions, justifying their localized computation in practical implementations. A rigorous a priori error analysis proves high-order convergence for both velocity and pressure, if the basis supports grow logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study an information-theoretic problem of designing a fair representation under a bounded point-wise statistical (demographic) parity constraint. More specifically, an agent uses some useful data (database) $X$ to solve a task $T$. Since both $X$ and $T$ are correlated with some latent sensitive attribute or secret $S$, the agent designs a representation $Y$ that satisfies a bounded point-wise statistical parity, that is, such that for all realizations of the representation $y\\in\\cal Y$, we have $\u03c7^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\\leq \u03b5$. In contrast to our previous work, here we use the point-wise measure instead of a bounded mutual information, and we assume that the agent has no direct access to $S$ and $T$; hence, the Markov chains $S - X - Y$ and $T - X - Y$ hold. In this work, we design $Y$ that maximizes the mutual information $I(Y;T)$ about the task while satisfying a bounded compression rate constraint, that is, ensuring that $I(Y;X) \\leq r$. Finally, $Y$ satisfies the point-wise bounded statistical parity constraint $\u03c7^2(P_{S|y};P_S)\\leq \u03b5$. When $\u03b5$ is small, concepts from information geometry allow us to locally approximate the KL-divergence and mutual information. To design the representation $Y$, we utilize this approximation and show that the main complex fairness design problem can be rewritten as a quadratic optimization problem that has simple closed-form solution under certain constraints. For the cases where the closed-form solution is not obtained we obtain lower bounds with low computational complexity. Here, we provide simple fairness designs with low complexity which are based on finding the maximum singular value and singular vector of a matrix. Finally, in a numerical example we compare our obtained results with the optimal solution.",

The fractional regularity of the pressure term is also exhibited and is formulated in terms of Orlicz-Besov spaces.

IRS are one of the alternatives proposed to overcome the problem of line-of-sight blocking in very high frequency wireless scenarios. The current state-of-the-art shows the difficulty of implementing practical IRS designs able to redirect large signal bandwidths, prone to the so-called beam split (BS) dispersion effect. In this work, we propose two highly efficient configuration techniques, adapted to ultrawideband downlink scenarios, based on localized optimization over the IRS surface. Such techniques exploit the BS effect while taking into account for the shape of the transmitted signal spectrum. Simulations considering different geometrical setups and different signal spectra show how the proposed techniques are able to guarantee an increased signal power at the receiver with respect to classical narrowband-based solutions or techniques that perform a global optimization over the entire IRS surface.",

However, J-groups lack an explicit presentation with abstract reflections as generators. This gap was filled by Gobet, and later by the second author, for the subfamily of so-called J-reflection groups. The obtained presentations then gave rise to a concept of J-braid group, which coincides with the link groups of torus necklaces.\n  In this paper we study a generalization of J-groups. We determine which of these groups are finitely generated. We show that, as for classical J-groups, the family of finite generalized J-groups coincides with the family of rank 2 complex reflection groups. We also show that finitely generated generalized J-groups coincide with what we call the torsion quotients of J-braid groups. We deduce explicit presentations for all finitely generated generalized J-groups, where the generators are abstract reflections. We also complete the classification of these groups up to reflection isomorphism.\n  As a byproduct of these results, we obtain that a quotient of a Seifert link group obtained by adding torsion to meridians somehow determines the link up to isotopy.

    "abstract": "The task of maintaining a predefined level of effect in a dynamical plant by applying periodic control actions often arises in e.g. process control and medicine. When the state variables of the plant represent the concentrations of chemical substances and the control action constitutes an instantaneous introduction of a certain quantity of a chemical or drug, this control setup is referred to as a (discrete) dosing problem. The present paper examines an amplitude- and frequency-modulated impulsive controller that, under stationary conditions, generates a desired sequence of uniform and equidistant control impulses based on continuous measurements of the output of a smooth positive nonlinear time-invariant single-input single-output plant with Wiener structure. The controller design method is based on constructing and stabilizing the fixed point of a discrete map that describes the evolution of the state vector of the continuous plant between successive impulsive control action instants. Stability of the fixed point ensures the existence of a basin of attraction along the stationary trajectory, where the solution of a perturbed closed-loop system converges to the stationary solution. The convergence rate is determined by the slopes of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions of the impulsive controller. The proposed controller is applied to the dosing of the drug \\emph{atracurium} in closed-loop neuromuscular blockade, and its performance is evaluated on a database of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models estimated from clinical data. It is demonstrated that an implementation of the standard regimen as a pulse-modulated feedback controller significantly minimizes the incidence of underdosing events.",

The resulting method is fully explicit, uniformly stable with respect to the Knudsen number and, in the fluid regime, it reduces to a consistent and high-order accurate solver for the limiting macroscopic equations of the mixture. The IMEX structure removes the stiffness associated with the relaxation term so that the time step is constrained only by a hyperbolic CFL condition. The full solver couples a high-order space and velocity discretization that includes third-order time integration, a CWENO3 finite-volume reconstruction in space, exact conservation of macroscopic moments in the discrete velocity space, and a multithreaded implementation. The proposed approach can handle an arbitrary number of species. Its accuracy and robustness are demonstrated on a set of multidimensional kinetic tests for gas mixtures, where the AP property and the correct asymptotics are numerically verified across different regimes.",

We show that this joint process can be interpreted as a second-order lift of a reversible diffusion process, the discrete stochastic heat equation with Gaussian invariant measure. In particular, we obtain a lower bound on the relaxation time of order $\u03a9(n^{3/2})$. Using a flow Poincar\u00e9 inequality, we prove an upper bound for a slightly modified dynamics of order $O(n^2)$, matching recent conjectures in the physics literature. Furthermore, since the self-repellent random walk and its local time process coincide with the Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the harmonic chain, a non-reversible MCMC method, we demonstrate that the relaxation time bound confirms the recent empirical observation that Event Chain Monte Carlo algorithms can outperform traditional MCMC methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.",

Using the results by van Doorn and Pollett (2008), we first prove that the continuous-time Maki--Thompson model has a unique quasi-stationary distribution (QSD) given by the point mass at the state \\((0, 1)\\). To obtain a non-trivial QSD, we modify the absorption set by conditioning the process on not returning to the level \\(y=1\\) after leaving the initial state \\((N, 1)\\). For this modified model, we establish the existence and uniqueness of a non-trivial QSD that assigns positive probability to all transient states, and then derive an explicit formula for this QSD in terms of paths and transition rates. We also discuss the ratio of expectations distribution as an alternative approach to describe the long-term behavior before absorption. The analysis is further extended to the Daley--Kendall rumor model and the stochastic SIR epidemic model.",

Classification variables can be expressed by means of a categorical scale which, at best, is ordinal. Because ordinal data lack a natural metric structure in their underlying space, most conventional distance measures aimed at assessing the accuracy of machine learning classifications cannot be directly or meaningfully applied. In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework for comparing ordinal data based on a family of Rank Graduation $(\\mathrm{RGX}_p)$ \\emph{metrics}. We demonstrate that these metrics can quantify the proportion of variability of the response explained by the predictions, in a similar manner as the predictive $R^2$ for continuous response variables. After establishing theoretical connections between the $\\mathrm{RGX}_p$ family and other prominent metrics in AI, we conduct extensive experiments across diverse datasets and learning tasks to evaluate their empirical performance. The results underscore the versatility, interpretability, and robustness of the $\\mathrm{RGX}_p$ metrics as a principled foundation for developing trustworthy and SAFE AI systems.",

We investigate properties of this procedure when applied to a general stationary processes possessing a spectral density with a dominant peak at some frequency $\u03bb_0\\in(0,\u03c0)$. We show that if the peak of the spectral density is sharp enough (in a way to be specified) then the AR(2) model, which best (in mean square sense) approximates the underlying process, correctly identifies the frequency $\u03bb_0$. To investigate consistency properties of the AR(2) based estimator of $\u03bb_0$, a near to pole framework is adopted. Triangular arrays of stationary stochastic processes are considered that possess a spectral density the peak of which at $\u03bb_0$ becomes more pronounced as the sample size $n$ of the observed time series increases to infinity. It is shown in this set up, that the AR(2) based estimator achieves a rate of convergence which is larger than the parametric $n^{-1/2}$ rate and which can be arbitrarily close to $ n^{-2/3}$, the best rate that can be achieved by this estimator.",

Despite they provide a geometrically consistent way of treating complex domains, applying such architectures to parameterized dynamical systems for temporal prediction beyond the training data, i.e. the extrapolation regime, is still a challenging task due to the simultaneous need of temporal causality and generalizability in the parametric space. In this work, we explore the integration of graph convolutional autoencoders (GCAs) with tensor train (TT) decomposition and Operator Inference (OpInf) to develop a time-consistent reduced-order model. In particular, high-fidelity snapshots are represented as a combination of parametric, spatial, and temporal cores via TT decomposition, while OpInf is used to learn the evolution of the latter. Moreover, we enhance the generalization performance by developing a multi-fidelity two-stages approach in the framework of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONet), treating the spatial and temporal cores as the trunk networks, and the parametric core as the branch network. Numerical results, including heat-conduction, advection-diffusion and vortex-shedding phenomena, demonstrate great performance in effectively learning the dynamic in the extrapolation regime for complex geometries, also in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches e.g. MeshGraphNets.",

    "abstract": "The Jeffreys-Lindley paradox stands as the most profound divergence between frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hypothesis testing. Yet despite more than six decades of discussion, this paradox remains frequently misunderstood--even in the pages of leading statistical journals. In a 1993 paper published in Statistica Sinica, Robert characterized the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox as \"the fact that a point null hypothesis will always be accepted when the variance of a conjugate prior goes to infinity.\" This characterization, however, describes a different phenomenon entirely-what we term Bartlett's Anomaly-rather than the Jeffreys-Lindley paradox as originally formulated. The paradox, as presented by Lindley (1957), concerns what happens as sample size increases without bound while holding the significance level fixed, not what happens as prior variance diverges. This distinction is not merely terminological: the two phenomena have different mathematical structures, different implications, and require different solutions. The present paper aims to clarify this confusion, demonstrating through Lindley's own equations that he was concerned exclusively with sample size asymptotics. We show that even Jeffreys himself underestimated the practical frequency of the paradox. Finally, we argue that the only genuine resolution lies in abandoning point null hypotheses in favor of interval nulls, a paradigm shift that eliminates the paradox and restores harmony between Bayesian and frequentist inference.

Phys. 443: 110516, 2021) and design a fifth-order hybrid fast sweeping scheme for solving steady state problems of hyperbolic conservation laws. Unlike many other fast sweeping methods, the explicit property of fixed-point fast sweeping methods provides flexibility to apply the alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (AWENO) scheme with unequal-sized substencils as the local solver, which facilitates the usage of arbitrary monotone numerical fluxes. Furthermore, a novel hybrid technique is designed in the local solver to combine the nonlinear AWENO interpolation with the linear scheme for an additional improvement in efficiency of the high-order fast sweeping iterations. Numerical examples show that the developed fixed-point fast sweeping hybrid AWENO method with unequal-sized substencils can achieve absolute convergence (i.e., the residue of the fast sweeping iterations converges to machine zero / round off errors) more easily than the original AWENO method with equal-sized substencils, and is more efficient than the popular third-order total variation diminishing (TVD) Runge-Kutta time-marching approach to converge to steady state solutions.",

    "abstract": "We present a geometric and variational derivation of the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad equation from Euler--Poincar'e reduction on an adjoint--coupled semidirect product (ACSP). In this construction a Lie group $G$ acts on $V=\\mathfrak{g}^{\\oplus m}$ by the adjoint representation together with a second, adjointly compatible action whose failure to commute defines an adjoint torsion $K(\u03be,v)$. This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\\tfrac\u03b3{2}[L,[L,\u03c1]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow. In this picture, decoherence is a curvature--induced contraction generated by Euler--Poincar'e reduction rather than a phenomenological input.",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful framework for constrained control, but its performance and safety can be severely degraded when the prediction model is learned online and thus remains uncertain. In this work, we develop a Bayesian risk-averse MPC framework for stochastic, discrete-time, nonlinear systems that provides theoretical guarantees on the consistency of Bayesian learning and closed-loop stability. First, we study Bayesian learning under the conditionally independent state transitions induced by feedback control and establish explicit conditions for Bayesian consistency on an infinitely countable parameter space. Second, we introduce a general notion of risk-averse asymptotic stability (RAAS), defined via comparison function classes and independent of any specific coherent risk measure or convergence rate, and we derive a risk-averse Lyapunov stability theorem together with MPC-specific stability conditions. Third, building on these foundations, we design a practical Bayesian risk-averse MPC scheme that separates epistemic (parametric) and aleatoric (disturbance) uncertainty: additive disturbances are treated in a risk-neutral fashion, while parametric uncertainty is managed via dynamically shrinking ambiguity sets constructed from Bayesian credible intervals, approximated online using particle filtering. To enable real-time implementation, we propose both an optimal and a sub-optimal receding-horizon control policy, the latter obtained by warm-starting from the previous solution, and prove that asymptotic RAAS is recovered as the Bayesian estimator becomes consistent.",

No modal indices $(m,n)$ are available, and the list may begin at an arbitrary unknown offset; in particular, the lowest eigenvalues may be missing, so classical formulas based on $\u03bb_{1,0}$ and $\u03bb_{0,1}$ cannot be used. Our reconstruction procedure extracts geometric information solely from the asymptotic density and oscillatory structure of the ordered spectrum. The area $ab$ is obtained from the high-frequency Weyl slope, while the fundamental lengths $2a$ and $2b$ appear as dominant periodic--orbit contributions in the Fourier transform of the spectral fluctuations. This separation of smooth and oscillatory components yields a robust, offset-agnostic recovery of both side lengths. The result is a fully index-free algorithm that reconstructs the geometry of a rectangular planar domain even when the spectrum is incomplete and all modal information is lost.",

We derive a functional version of the Feldman-H'ajek criterion and prove that equivalence of the Gaussian measures induced by two Hilbert-valued spherical fields is determined by a Hilbert summability condition involving Schoenberg functional sequences, extending classical results for scalar and vector fields to the infinite-dimensional setting. We further show how equivalence of all scalar projections is contained within, and dominated by, the functional criterion. The theory is illustrated through two models: (i) a multiquadratic bivariate family on $\\mathbb{S}^{d}$, where the equivalence region has a closed-form description in terms of cross-correlation and geodesic decay parameters, and (ii) an infinite-dimensional Legendre-Mat'ern construction, where operator-valued spectra yield identifiability conditions on smoothness and scale. These examples show how operator-valued Schoenberg coefficients govern both geometry and measure-theoretic behavior of functional spherical fields. Overall, the results provide a unified spectral framework for Gaussian measures on $L^{2}(\\mathbb{S}^{d};\\mathcal{H})$, bridging harmonic analysis, operator theory, and stochastic geometry on manifolds, and offering tools for functional data analysis, spatial statistics, and kernel methods on spherical domains.",

    "abstract": "We present a geometric and variational derivation of the Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad equation from Euler--Poincar'e reduction on an adjoint--coupled semidirect product (ACSP). In this construction a Lie group $G$ acts on $V=\\mathfrak{g}^{\\oplus m}$ by the adjoint representation together with a second, adjointly compatible action whose failure to commute defines an adjoint torsion $K(\u03be,v)$. This torsion generates a canonical quadratic curvature operator on $\\mathfrak{g}^*$ that survives reduction and yields a metric double--bracket term. For $G=SU(n)$ the reduced Euler--Poincar'e equation reproduces exactly the GKSL generator: the Hamiltonian part arises from the coadjoint action, while the dissipator $-\\tfrac\u03b3{2}[L,[L,\u03c1]]$ appears as the torsion--induced metric component of an ACSP bracket. We prove a characterization theorem showing that any quadratic $SU(n)$--equivariant operator generated by torsion factorizes into a Lindblad double commutator; a uniqueness theorem establishing that, under natural structural assumptions, the only admissible dissipator is the Lindblad form; and an orbit--contraction theorem showing strict contraction toward the commutant of the Lindblad operators. For $SU(2)$ and $SU(3)$ the ACSP geometry yields explicit Bloch equations for representative dissipative channels. We also show that the ACSP bracket fits into a metriplectic and contact--geometric framework in which the Lindblad term is the metric component and the Reeb part of a contact Hamiltonian flow. In this picture, decoherence is a curvature--induced contraction generated by Euler--Poincar'e reduction rather than a phenomenological input.",

In this work, we develop a Bayesian risk-averse MPC framework for stochastic, discrete-time, nonlinear systems that provides theoretical guarantees on the consistency of Bayesian learning and closed-loop stability. First, we study Bayesian learning under the conditionally independent state transitions induced by feedback control and establish explicit conditions for Bayesian consistency on an infinitely countable parameter space. Second, we introduce a general notion of risk-averse asymptotic stability (RAAS), defined via comparison function classes and independent of any specific coherent risk measure or convergence rate, and we derive a risk-averse Lyapunov stability theorem together with MPC-specific stability conditions. Third, building on these foundations, we design a practical Bayesian risk-averse MPC scheme that separates epistemic (parametric) and aleatoric (disturbance) uncertainty: additive disturbances are treated in a risk-neutral fashion, while parametric uncertainty is managed via dynamically shrinking ambiguity sets constructed from Bayesian credible intervals, approximated online using particle filtering. To enable real-time implementation, we propose both an optimal and a sub-optimal receding-horizon control policy, the latter obtained by warm-starting from the previous solution, and prove that asymptotic RAAS is recovered as the Bayesian estimator becomes consistent.",

Expanding upon previously done work by Juntarapomdach and Kittipassorn, we show that $K_{3,3,3}$ is not a TRVG, and classify complete $k$-partite TRVGs. We also prove that the complement of $C^2_n$ is not a TRVG whenever $n \\geq 15$, and that every $k$-partite TRVG with $n$ vertices has at most $2(k-1)n-k(k-1)$ edges.

Despite the absence of the algebraic structure of a field, the geometric inner-product structure suffices to introduce the Tucker rank, higher-order SVD, and Tucker-cross decomposition for function-valued tensors. An adaptive cross-approximation algorithm is developed to compute low-rank approximations of such tensors. The framework is motivated by, and applied to, model order reduction of the parameter-to-solution map for a parametric PDE. The resulting reduced-order model can be interpreted as an encoder-decoder scheme with a nonlinear encoder and a multilinear decoder. The performance of the proposed non-intrusive approximation method is demonstrated in numerical examples for two nonlinear parametric PDE systems.",

Traditional broken-FEEC allows for discontinuous discretizations at patch interfaces, preserving the de Rham structure and offering computational benefits. However, local refinements often lead to numerical artifacts. Our solution involves developing moment-preserving discrete conforming projection operators. These operators are explicit, localized, and metric-independent, ensuring $H^1$ and $H(\\text{curl})$ continuity across non-matching interfaces while preserving high-order polynomial moments. This results in broken-FEEC de Rham sequences with accurate strong and weak derivatives, leading to energy-preserving Maxwell solvers that are explicit and virtually free of spurious modes. Numerical simulations confirm the efficacy of our method in eliminating spurious waves.",

We employ linear interpolation in time to reconstruct the discrete space-time magnetization.

Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $L/K$ be a Galois extension of abelian number fields with $p$-power Galois group. For an elliptic curve $E/\\mathbb{Q}$, we study the Mazur-Tate elements over the finite layers of the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions of $K$ and $L$. We show that the vanishing of the $\u03bc$-invariant is preserved in the extension: if the level-$n$ Mazur-Tate element over $K$ has $\u03bc= 0$, then the corresponding element over $L$ also has $\u03bc= 0$. Moreover, the associated $\u03bb$-invariants satisfy an explicit transition formula. This parallels the work of Hachimori-Matsuno on Selmer groups and of Matsuno on $p$-adic $L$-functions. As an application, we obtain an analogue of Kida's formula for the analytic Iwasawa invariants associated to Pollack's signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. Since our results apply to elliptic curves with any reduction type at $p$ under mild hypotheses, including those with additive reduction, we also obtain a Kida-type formula for the $p$-adic $L$-functions constructed by Delbourgo for elliptic curves with unstable additive reduction. In particular, because Mazur-Tate elements approximate $p$-adic $L$-functions in the limit, our results unify all previously known cases of Kida's formula for analytic Iwasawa invariants.",

Nevertheless, existing IOC methods have consistency issue with the estimator under noisy and nonlinear settings. In this paper, we consider a discrete-time nonlinear system with process noise, and it is controlled by an optimal policy that minimizes the expectation of a discounted cumulative cost function across an infinite time-horizon. In particular, the cost function takes the form of a linear combination of a priori known feature functions. In this setting, we first adopt Lasserre's reformulation of the forward problem with occupancy measure. Next, we propose the infinite dimensional IOC algorithm and further approximate it with Lagrange interpolating polynomials, which results in a convex, finite-dimensional sum-of-squares optimization. Moreover, the estimator is shown to be asymptotically and statistically consistent. Finally, we validate the theoretical results and illustrate the performance of our method with numerical experiments. In addition, the robustness and generalizability performance of the proposed IOC algorithm are also illustrated.",

This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.\n  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \\leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.\n  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality.

    "abstract": "Recent work introduced a robust computational framework combining embedded mathematical structures, advanced optimization, and neural network architecture, leading to the discovery of multiple unstable self-similar solutions for key fluid dynamics equations, including the Incompressible Porous Media (IPM) and 2D Boussinesq systems. While this framework confirmed the existence of these singularities, an accuracy level approaching double-float machine precision was only achieved for stable and 1st unstable solutions of the 1D C\u00f3rdoba-C\u00f3rdoba-Fontelos model. For highly unstable solutions characterized by extreme gradients, the accuracy remained insufficient for validation. The primary obstacle is the presence of sharp solution gradients. Those gradients tend to induce large, localized PDE residuals during training, which not only hinder convergence, but also obscure the subtle signals near the origin required to identify the correct self-similar scaling parameter lambda of the solutions. In this work, we introduce a gradient-normalized PDE residual re-weighting scheme to resolve the high-gradient challenge while amplifying the critical residual signals at the origin for lambda identification. Coupled with the multi-stage neural network architecture, the PDE residuals are reduced to the level of round-off error across a wide spectrum of unstable self-similar singularities previously discovered. Furthermore, our method enables the discovery of new highly unstable singularities, i.e. the 4th unstable solution for IPM equations and a novel family of highly unstable solitons for the Nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations. This results in achieving high-gradient solutions with high precision, providing an important ingredient for bridging the gap between numerical discovery and computer-assisted proofs for unstable phenomena in nonlinear PDEs.",

The construction only involves the Euler products over the primes $p \\leq x = \u03bb^2$ and produces self-adjoint operators whose spectra coincide, with striking numerical accuracy, with the lowest non-trivial zeros of $\u03b6(1/2 + i s)$, even for small values of $x$.\n  The theoretical foundation rests on the framework introduced in \"Spectral triples and zeta-cycles\" (Enseign.

The model is conjectured to exhibit nematic order at low temperatures, in the sense of orientational symmetry breaking coupled with the absence of translational order, provided that $\u03bb+a>0$. In this paper, we prove this conjecture under the additional condition that $a>\u03bb/3$, significantly extending the parameter regime under which the conjecture is known to hold. Our proof adapts the strategy of Hadas and Peled (2025) for proving the existence of a columnar phase in the hard-square model, combining a mesoscopic characterization of orientational order with the disagreement percolation method of van den Berg (1993) to prove the absence of translational order.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenging problem of parameter estimation for multicomponent complex exponential signals, commonly known as sums of cisoids. Traditional approaches that estimate individual component parameters face significant difficulties when the number of components is large, including permutation ambiguity, computational complexity from high-dimensional Fisher information matrix inversion, and model order selection issues. We introduce a novel framework based on low-dimensional sum-parameters that capture essential global characteristics of the signal ensemble. These parameters include the sum of amplitudes, the power-weighted frequency, and the phase-related sum. These quantities possess clear physical interpretations representing total signal strength, power-weighted average frequency, and composite phase information, while completely avoiding permutation ambiguities. We derive exact closed-form Cramer-Rao bounds for these sum-parameters under both deterministic and stochastic signal models. Our analysis reveals that the frequency sumparameter achieves statistical efficiency comparable to single-component estimators while automatically benefiting from power pooling across all signal components. The proposed Efficient Global Estimation Method (EGEM) demonstrates asymptotic efficiency across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios, significantly outperforming established techniques such as Zoom-Interpolated FFT and Root-MUSIC in both long- and short-sample regimes. Extensive numerical simulations involving 2000 Monte-Carlo trials confirm that EGEM closely approaches the theoretical performance bounds even with relatively small sample sizes of 250 observations.",

But if the Hessian of the objective function has a nontrivial kernel at the critical point, then these results are inconclusive. In this paper, we show how relevant information can be extracted by ``blowing up'' the objective function around the non-strict saddle point, i.e., by a suitable nonlinear rescaling that makes the higher order geometry visible.

    "abstract": "In 2019, Trombetti and Zhou introduced a new family of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-linear Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. For such codes we propose a new syndrome-based decoding algorithm. It is well known that a syndrome-based decoding approach relies heavily on a parity-check matrix of a linear code. Nonetheless, Trombetti-Zhou codes are not linear over the entire field $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$, but only over its subfield $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$. Due to this lack of linearity, we introduce the notions of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-generator matrix and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-parity-check matrix for a generic $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{n}}$-linear rank-metric code over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{rn}}$ in analogy with the roles that generator and parity-check matrices play in the context of linear codes. Accordingly, we present an $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-generator matrix and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$-parity-check matrix for Trombetti-Zhou codes as evaluation codes over an $\\mathbb{F}_q$-basis of $\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2n}}$. This relies on the choice of a particular basis called \\emph{trace almost dual basis}. Subsequently, denoting by $d$ the minimum distance of the code, we show that if the rank weight $t$ of the error vector is strictly smaller than $\\frac{d-1}{2}$, the syndrome-based decoding of Trombetti-Zhou codes can be converted to the decoding of Gabidulin codes of dimension one larger. On the other hand, when $t=\\frac{d-1}{2}$, we reduce the decoding to determining the rank of a certain matrix. The complexity of the proposed decoding for Trombetti-Zhou codes is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Originally introduced to describe a transition region in stars, the magnetic rotating shallow water (MRSW) model is now used in many solar physics and geophysical applications. Derived from the 3-D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic system, the shallow nature of these applications motivates depth-averaging of both the velocities and magnetic fields. This is advantageous in terms of computational efficiency -- but at the loss of vertical information, thus limiting the predictive power of the MRSW model. To overcome this problem, we employ higher-order vertical moments, but now in the context of conductive fluids. In doing so, the new approximation maintains non-constant vertical profiles of both the horizontal magnetic fields and horizontal velocities, while still remaining in the simplified 2-D framework corresponding to depth integration. In this work, we extend the derivation of the shallow water moment equations to derive the MRSW moment system of arbitrary order; i.e., we represent the vertical profiles of the velocities -- and now additionally the magnetic fields -- by arbitrary-order polynomial expansions, and close the new expanded 2-D system with evolution equations for these polynomial coefficients, found via Galerkin projection. Through numerical experiments for MRSW moment systems up to third-order, we demonstrate that these moment approximations reduce model error without significantly sacrificing computational efficiency.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a two-step stepsize schedule for stochastic gradient methods minimizing smooth strongly convex functions. We consider the setting where only stochastic gradient approximations, which are unbiased, of bounded variance, and supported on a finite set, are accessible. When the variance bound is relatively smaller than a ratio of the initial optimality gap, the proposed stepsize schedule achieves better convergence performance compared to the well-regarded constant stepsize \u03b1 = 2/(M+m), where m and M denote the strong convexity and gradient-Lipschitz parameters, respectively. Our stepsize schedule can be viewed as a generalization of the well-known two-step silver stepsize schedule in [J. M. Altschuler and P. A. Parrilo, Journal of the ACM, 72(2):1-38, 2025] from deterministic setting to stochastic optimization.",

The study of flames was initiated by Lov\u00e1sz, who showed that in a finite rooted digraph, the edge-minimal subgraphs that preserve all local edge-connectivities from the root are always flames. It is known that the edge sets of the flame subgraphs of any finite rooted digraph form a greedoid. Szeszl\u00e9r showed recently that if the digraph is acyclic, then the bases of this greedoid are the bases of a matroid. We show that a suitable formulation of Szeszl\u00e9r's theorem is valid for infinite digraphs under the additional assumption that there are no backward-infinite directed paths (which assumption is indeed essential). We also prove that the ''correct'' infinite generalisation of Lov\u00e1sz's theorem also holds for this class of digraphs.",

The method defines a relative completion within the union space $X_0 \\cup X_1$, yielding a well-defined interpolated metric space with controllable relationships between the $J_M$ and $K_M$ metrics. While we do not compare this method to the previously developed approaches nor explore its correspondence with classical interpolation functors in normed spaces, the construction enriches the set of tools available for metric-space interpolation theory. Furthermore, as expected, these methods still preserve the Lipschitz property of an operator between two interpolated spaces.\n  Potential applications include general Nonlinear Analysis and Wasserstein-type spaces where the sequence-based nature of the method may provide practical advantages.",

Consequently, the proportion of $P$-avoiding rectangulations among all rectangulations tends to zero as $n\\to \\infty$. This is the first result on the uniform drop of exponential growth for pattern-avoiding rectangulations.

In this context, we present a 3D solver of the time-harmonic adiabatic stellar oscillation equations without background flows on a domain consisting of the Sun and its photosphere. The background medium consists of 3D heterogeneities on top of a radial strongly-stratified standard solar model. The oscillation equations are solved with the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method, considering a first-order formulation in terms of the vector displacement and the pressure perturbation. This method combines the high-order accuracy and the parallelism of DG methods while yielding smaller linear systems. These are solved with a direct solver, with block low-rank compression and mixed-precision arithmetic to reduce memory footprint. The trade-off between compression and solution accuracy is investigated, and our 3D solver is validated by comparing with resolution under axial symmetry for solar backgrounds. The capacity of the solver is illustrated with wave speed heterogeneities characteristic of two physical phenomena: active regions and convection. We show the importance of global 3D gravito-acoustic wave simulations, in particular when the amplitudes of the perturbations are strong and their effect on the wavefield cannot be estimated by linear approximations.",

The 3-restricted edge-connectivity of a graph \\( G \\), denoted by \\( \u03bb_3(G) \\), is defined as the minimum cardinality among all 3-restricted edge-cuts if there are at least one; otherwise, \\( \u03bb_3(G) = +\\infty \\).

    "abstract": "Given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a $k$-set $S\\subseteq V(G)$, the $Steiner$ $distance$ $d_{G}(S)$ of $S$ is defined as the size of a minimum tree including $S$ in $G$. The $Steiner$ $k$-$eccentricity$ of a vertex $v$ in $G$ is the maximum value of $d_G(S)$ over all $S\\subseteq V(G)$ with $|S|=k$ and $v\\in S$. The minimum Steiner $k$-eccentricity over all vertices, denoted by $Sr_k(G)$, is called the $Steiner$ $k$-$radius$ of $G$ and the maximum Steiner $k$-eccentricity over all vertices, denoted by $Sd_k(G)$, is its $Steiner$ $k$-$diameter$. The $Steiner$ $(k,k^{\\prime})$-$eccentricity$ of a $k^{\\prime}$-subset $S^{\\prime}$ of $V(G)$, which is an extension of the Steiner $k$-eccentricity of a vertex $v$, is defined as the maximum Steiner distance over all $k$-subsets of $V(G)$ containing $S^{\\prime}$. The minimum Steiner $(k,k^{\\prime})$-eccentricity among all $k^{\\prime}$-subsets of $V(G)$, denoted by $Sr_{k,k^{\\prime}}(G)$, is called the $Steiner$ $(k,k^{\\prime})$-$radius$ of $G$. In 1989, Chartrand, Oellermann, Tian and Zou showed that for any $k\\geq3$, $Sd_k(T)\\leq \\frac{k}{k-1}Sr_k(T)$ for any tree $T$. In this paper, we generalize this result and show that $Sd_k(T)\\leq \\frac{k}{k-k^{\\prime}}Sr_{k,k^{\\prime}}(T)$ for any $k\\geq3$, $k>k^{\\prime}\\geq1$. Furthermore, for $k^{\\prime}=2$ and $k^{\\prime}=3$, we obtain a tight upper bound of the Steiner $k$-diameter by the Steiner $(k,k^{\\prime})$-radius for all trees.",

    "abstract": "Variational methods have been used to study stochastic control for long, see Bensoussan (1982) and Bensoussan-Lions (1978) for the early works. More precisely, variational approaches apply to the study of Bellman equation as a parabolic quasi-linear equation, when the nonlinearity affects only the gradient of the solution, and the second order derivative term is linear and not degenerate. This corresponds to a stochastic control problem, where the state equation is a diffusion process. The primary objective of this article is to extend this approach to mean field control theory, as an alternative to the current approach, which considers a coupled system of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) and Fokker-Planck (FP) equations, since the introduction of the theory by Lasry-Lions (2007). The main novelty lies in that the equation studied here is the HJB equation, neither the HJ-FP system nor the master equation; and our results also provide another perspective for probabilistic approaches; see Chassagneux-Crisan-Delarue (2022), Bensoussan-Wong-Yam-Yuan (2024), Bensoussan-Tai-Yam (2025) and Bensoussan-Huang-Tang-Yam (2025) for instance. Within the scope of the PDE methods, the advantage of this article is to solve a larger class of mean field control problems, with moderate regularity; and this kind of variational methods fairly require few conditions on the regularity of the coefficients.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a symbol error rate (SER) analysis is provided to evaluate the impact of localization inaccuracy on the communication performance under Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Minimum Mean-Square Error (MMSE) equalizers. Specifically, we adopt a pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localization (PASCAL) system, in which multiple drones actively transmit signals towards the base station (BS). Upon receiving the signal, the BS estimates the drones' location parameters to reconstruct the channel matrix, which is then utilized for ZF and MMSE equalization. As the channel matrix is characterized by the estimated parameters associated with the target's location and the matrix inversion involved in ZF and MMSE further complicates the analysis, obtaining a closed-form SER expression becomes intractable. Thus, a tightly approximated SER expression is respectively derived for ZF and MMSE by using a hybrid approximation method incorporating Neumann approximation and Taylor approximation. Our analysis reveals several important design insights: first, the average SER of drone $k$ for both ZF and MMSE can be affected by the localization errors from all drones including drone $k$; second, the average SER of ZF is unaffected by the estimation inaccuracy of range, whereas the average SER of MMSE is influenced by it; third, ZF and MMSE is the most susceptible to the influence of angle estimation errors compared to the other localization errors; fourth, ZF is highly sensitive to localization errors and may be even worse than maximal ratio combining (MRC) under some conditions of significant estimation errors. Numerical simulation results verify our findings and also validate the accuracy of the analysis across a wide range of system parameters.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines the conditions under which Bayesian conditioning aligns with Maximum Entropy. Specifically, I address cases in which newly learned information does not correspond to an event in the probability space defined on the sample space of outcomes. To facilitate Bayesian conditioning in such cases, one must therefore extend the probability space so that the new information becomes an event in this expanded space. Skyrms (1985) argues that Bayesian conditioning in an extended probability space on a product space of outcomes aligns precisely with the solution from Maximum Entropy. In contrast, Seidenfeld (1986) uses Friedman and Shimony's (1971) result to criticize Skyrms' approach as trivial, suggesting that alignment holds only under a degenerate probability model. Here, I argue that Friedman and Shimony's result must either (1) be a benign consequence of Skyrms' approach, or (2) pose a universal challenge to any method of extending spaces. Accepting (2) would imply that Bayesian conditioning is incapable of accommodating information beyond the probability space defined on the original outcome space.",

We study the oracle complexity of finding an $\u03b5$-stationary point with first-order methods when the upper-level problem is nonconvex and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent works (Ji et al., ICML 2021; Arbel and Mairal, ICLR 2022; Chen el al., JMLR 2025) achieve a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\u03ba^4 \u03b5^{-2})$ upper bound that is near-optimal in $\u03b5$.

    "abstract": "Benders' decomposition (BD) is a framework for solving optimization problems by removing some variables and modeling their contribution to the original problem via so-called Benders cuts. While many advanced optimization techniques can be applied in a BD framework, one central technique has not been applied systematically in BD: symmetry handling. The main reason for this is that Benders cuts are not known explicitly but only generated via a separation oracle.\n  In this work, we close this gap by developing a theory of symmetry detection within the BD framework. To this end, we introduce a tailored family of graphs that capture the symmetry information of both the Benders master problem and the Benders oracles. Once symmetries of these graphs are known, which can be found by established techniques, classical symmetry handling approaches become available to accelerate BD. We complement these approaches by devising techniques for the separation and aggregation of symmetric Benders cuts by means of tailored separation routines and extended formulations. Both substantially reduce the number of executions of the separation oracles. In a numerical study, we show the effect of both symmetry handling and cut aggregation for bin packing and scheduling problems.",

    "abstract": "Given an oriented graph $D$, the inversion of a subset $X$ of vertices consists in reversing the orientation of all arcs with both endpoints in $X$. When the subset $X$ is of size $p$ (resp. at most $p$), this operation is called an $(=p)$-inversion (resp. $(\\leq p)$-inversion). Then, an oriented graph is $(=p)$-invertible if it can be made acyclic by a sequence of $p$-inversions. We observe that, for $n=|V(D)|$, deciding whether $D$ is $(=n-1)$-invertible is equivalent to deciding whether $D$ is acyclically pushable, and thus NP-complete. In all other cases, when $p \\neq n-1$, we construct a polynomial-time algorithm to decide $(=p)$-invertibility.\n  We then consider the $(= p)$-inversion number, $\\text{inv}^{= p}(D)$ (resp. $(\\leq p)$-inversion number, $\\text{inv}^{\\leq p}(D)$), defined as the minimum number of $(=p)$-inversions (resp. $(\\leq p)$-inversions) rendering $D$ acyclic. We show that every $(=p)$-invertible digraph $D$ satisfies $\\text{inv}^{= p}(D) \\leq |A(D)|$ for every integer $p\\geq 2$. When $p$ is even, we bound $\\text{inv}^{= p}$ by a (linear) function of the feedback arc set number, and rule out the existence of any bounding function for odd $p$.\n  Finally, we study the complexity of deciding whether the $(= p)$-inversion number, or the $(\\leq p)$-inversion number, of a given oriented graph is at most a given integer $k$. For any fixed positive integer $p \\geq 2$, when $k$ is part of the input, we show that both problems are NP-hard even in tournaments. In general oriented graphs, we prove $W[1]$-hardness for both problems when parameterized by $p$, even for $k=1$. In contrast, we exhibit polynomial kernels in $p + k$ for both problems in tournaments.",

This approach addresses both line-of-sight (LoS) dominant rural and probabilistic non-line-of-sight (NLoS) urban scenarios. Furthermore, a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is developed, revealing the fundamental diversity order of the UAV-to-user link. Based on this, we further address the practical issue of energy efficiency. A realistic energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, which explicitly accounts for the time and energy overhead inherent in the FAS port selection process, a factor often omitted in idealized models. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is then proposed to jointly optimize the key system parameters. Extensive numerical results validate the analysis and illustrate that while FASs can yield substantial power gains, the operational overhead introduces a non-trivial trade-off. This trade-off leads to an optimal number of ports and fundamentally different UAV deployment strategies in rural versus urban environments. This work provides both foundational analysis and practical design guidelines for FAS-enabled UAV communications.",

Starting from an $n$-ary $\u0393$-semiring $(T,+,\\tilde\u03bc)$ and its $\u0393$-ideals, we work in the slot-sensitive categories of left, right, and bi-$\u0393$-modules, and endow the bi-module category with a Quillen exact structure compatible with the $n$-ary multiplication. Within this exact framework we construct bar-type projective resolutions and cofree-based injective resolutions under natural $\u0393$-Noetherian and $\u0393$-regular hypotheses on $T$, and we obtain finite projective resolutions for finitely presented bi-modules under $\u0393$-Noetherian conditions. On this basis we define the derived functors $\\ExtG$ and $\\TorG$ for bi-$\u0393$-modules, prove their balance with respect to projective and injective resolutions, establish long exact sequences and a Yoneda interpretation via iterated extensions, and construct K\u00fcnneth-type spectral sequences and base-change isomorphisms. Interpreting bi-$\u0393$-modules as quasi-coherent sheaves on the non-commutative $\u0393$-spectrum $\\SpecGnC{T}$, these homological invariants provide the appropriate derived language for a non-commutative $\u0393$-geometry and prepare the ground for the spectral and geometric analysis carried out in the third part of this series.",

    "abstract": "The sequence space of all real-valued sequences, denoted $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$, is typically investigated through the lens of infinite-dimensional vector spaces, utilizing Banach space norms or Schauder bases. This work proposes a complementary, constructive classification based instead on the asymptotic limit profile encoded by the pair $(\\liminf a_n, \\limsup a_n)$. We demonstrate that this perspective naturally partitions $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$ into seven mutually disjoint macroscale blocks, covering behaviors from finite convergence to bounded and unbounded oscillation. For each block, we provide explicit closed-form representative sequences and establish that every constituent class possesses the cardinality of the continuum. Furthermore, we investigate the structural relationships between these blocks at two distinct levels of granularity. At the macroscale, we employ injective mappings to define an idealized connectivity graph, while at the microscale, we introduce a connection relation governed by the Hadamard (pointwise) product. This dual analysis reveals a rich directed graph structure where the block of finite convergent sequences functions as a global attractor with no outgoing connections. Statistical comparisons between the idealized and realized adjacency matrices indicate that the pointwise product structure realizes approximately two-thirds of the theoretically possible macroscale relations. Ultimately, this partition-based framework endows the seemingly chaotic space $Seq(\\mathbb{R})$ with a transparent, geometrically interpretable internal structure.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic study of the calculus of interval-valued functions and its application to interval differential equations. To this end, first, we introduce new interval arithmetic operations. Under new operations, the space of interval numbers becomes a strict linear space, and indeed a Hilbert space, whereas the traditional interval arithmetic yields only a semilinear space with a defective algebraic structure. Secondly, by basing derivative and integral of interval-valued functions on the proposed operations, we retain every essential property of classical calculus while seamlessly incorporating ideas from the multiplicative calculus. The resulting unified hybrid framework eliminates the tedious case-by-case inspection of switching points required by the gH-derivative, leading to a markedly streamlined computational procedure. Finally, we establish an existence theorem for solutions of interval differential equations within the new calculus and corroborate its validity and practicality through representative examples. In contrast to the gH-derivative approach, the number of potential solutions does not explode doubly with additional switching points, ensuring robustness in both theory and computation.",

    "title": "Leveraging Channel Knowledge Map for Multi-User Hierarchical Beam Training Under Position Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "Channel knowledge map (CKM) emerges as a promising framework to acquire location-specific channel information without consuming wireless resources, creating new horizons for advanced wireless network design and optimization. Despite its potential, the practical application of CKM in beam training faces several challenges. On one hand, the user's precise location is typically unavailable prior to beam training, which limits the utility of CKM since its effectiveness relies heavily on accurate input of position data. On the other hand, the intricate interplay among CKM, real-time observations, and training strategies has not been thoroughly studied, leading to suboptimal performance and difficulties in practical implementation. In this paper, we present a framework for CKM-aided beam training that addresses these limitations. For single-user scenario, we propose a reward-motivated beam-potential hierarchical strategy which integrates partial position information and CKM. This strategy models the user equipment (UE) position uncertainty and formulates the hierarchical searching process as a pruned binary search tree. An optimal hierarchical searching strategy with minimal overhead is derived by evaluating the weights and rewards of potential codewords. Furthermore, a low-complexity two-layer lookahead scheme is designed to balance overhead and computational demands. For multi-user scenario, we develop a correlation-driven position-pruning training scheme, where sidelobe gains from inter-user interference are exploited to provide additional side information for overhead reduction, allowing all users to be simultaneously assigned their respective supportive beams. Simulations validate the superior performances of proposed approaches in advancing 6G beam training.",

Finally, we discuss a simple family of mixed-integer rounding inequalities that especially benefit from the reformulation, and we show its benefit within different MIP solvers.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel structure-preserving vertex-staggered semi-implicit four-split discretization of a unified first order hyperbolic formulation of continuum mechanics that is able to describe at the same time fluid and solid materials within the same mathematical model. The governing PDE system goes back to pioneering work of Godunov, Romenski, Peshkov and collaborators. Previous structure-preserving discretizations of this system allowed to respect the curl-free properties of the distortion field and the specific thermal impulse in the absence of source terms and were consistent with the low Mach number limit with respect to the adiabatic sound speed. However, the evolution of the thermal impulse and the distortion field were still discretized explicitly, thus requiring a rather severe CFL stability restriction on the time step based on the shear sound speed and the finite, but potentially large, speed of heat waves. Instead, the new four-split semi-implicit scheme presented in this paper has a material time step restriction only. For this purpose, the governing PDE system is split into four subsystems: i) a convective subsystem, which is the only one that is treated explicitly; ii) a heat subsystem, iii) a subsystem containing momentum, distortion field and specific thermal impulse; iv) a pressure subsystem. The three subsystems ii)-iv) are all discretized implicitly, hence a rather mild CFL restriction based on the velocity of the continuum is imposed. The method is asymptotically consistent with the low Mach number limit and the stiff relaxation limits. Moreover, it maintains an exactly curl-free distortion field and thermal impulse in the case of linear source terms or in their absence. The scheme is benchmarked against classical test cases verifying its theoretical properties.",

This study develops a two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming framework that jointly optimizes the location of oil spill response stations and the allocation of heterogeneous resources across multiple probabilistic spill scenarios. The model integrates a weighted objective that combines spill volume, environmental sensitivity index (ESI), response time, and costs for station setup, deployment, and inter station transfer. Separate importance weights for coverage and cost, together with internal ecological weights, allow decision makers to balance ecological protection and operational efficiency. Data was compiled from Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation spill records and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ESI layers and are converted into model ready scenarios through harmonization and sampling. The model is solved with the Gurobi optimizer, and sensitivity analysis is performed over 324 combinations of importance and ecological weights. Results show about a 35.45% percent improvement in response effectiveness over deterministic methods, as confirmed by the value of the stochastic solution, and reveal clear tradeoffs between cost and ecological coverage. The framework provides a data driven decision support tool for Arctic emergency planners that simultaneously accounts for uncertainty, environmental sensitivity, and realistic logistical constraints.",

    "abstract": "Fluid antenna systems encompass a broad class of reconfigurable antenna technologies that offer substantial spatial diversity for various optimization objectives and communication tasks. Their capability to enhance spatial resolution within a fixed physical aperture makes fluid antennas particularly attractive for next-generation wireless deployments. In this work, we focus on the beamforming problem using a two-dimensional planar fluid antenna array. Since both narrow-beam and broad-beam patterns are essential in practical communication networks, enabling flexible beamforming through fluid antennas becomes an important and interesting research direction. We establish a unified and flexible framework that connects arbitrary beam-pattern synthesis with fluid-antenna port selection. The resulting formulation transforms beam-pattern reconstruction into a sparse regression problem, which is addressed using a tailored compressive sensing algorithm designed to operate efficiently with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). Furthermore, to ensure physically consistent phase modeling in the desired beam, we introduce an iterative FFT-based phase retrieval method. Owing to its structure, the proposed phase-refinement procedure exhibits low computational complexity and rapid convergence, requiring only one FFT and one inverse FFT per iteration. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed flexible beamforming framework. Compared with conventional fixed-array architectures, fluid antennas exhibit significantly improved beam-pattern reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their potential for high-resolution and adaptive beamforming in future wireless systems.",

The vector liftings which are $2$-marginals with respect to a suitable product yielded a characterization of stochastic processes having a measurable modification modelled on one discovered by Musia\u0142, and led to a proof of the characterization that does not use liftings. The improvement relies on results on extending a measure by null sets that apply when the family of new null sets is an ideal of a $\u03c3$-algebra larger than the domain of the measure, but not necessarily an ideal of the power set.

Recently, neural network-based decoders have emerged as promising tools for enhancing ECC reliability, yet their high computational complexity prevents their potential practical deployment. In this paper, we take a different approach and design a neural transmission scheme that employs the transformer architecture in order to improve the reliability of existing ECCs. We call this approach TransCoder, alluding both to its function and architecture. TransCoder operates as a code-adaptive neural module aimed at performance enhancement that can be implemented flexibly at either the transmitter, receiver, or both. The framework employs an iterative decoding procedure, where both noisy information from the channel and updates from the conventional ECC decoder are processed by a neural decoder block, utilizing a block attention mechanism for efficiency. Through extensive simulations with various conventional codes (LDPC, BCH, Polar, and Turbo) and across a wide range of channel conditions, we demonstrate that TransCoder significantly improves block error rate (BLER) performance while maintaining computational complexity comparable to traditional decoders. Notably, our approach is particularly effective for longer codes (block length >64) and at lower code rates, scenarios in which existing neural decoders often struggle (despite their formidable computational complexity). The results establish TransCoder as a promising practical solution for reliable communication among resource-constrained wireless devices.",

More generally, there are three (not necessarily real) exparabolas with axes through a given point $X$. Their focal points determine another triangle which we call the $X$-focal triangle. It shares the circumcircle with the original triangle and its orthocenter is $X$. The sequence of iterated focal triangles with respect to the centroids splits into an even and an odd sub-sequence that both converge to equilateral triangles.",

    "abstract": "We consider the so-called {\\it strongly co-Hopfian} and {\\it uniformly strongly co-Hopfian} Abelian groups, significantly generalizing some important results due to Abdelalim in the J. Math. Analysis (2015). Specifically, we prove that any strongly co-Hopfian group is a direct sum of an sp-group and a divisible group, both of which are strongly co-Hopfian. We also show that a group whose maximal torsion subgroup and corresponding torsion-free factor are both strongly co-Hopfian will also be strongly co-Hopfian. We provide several examples demonstrating that the converse of this statement does {\\it not} generally hold, thus illustrating that the structure of genuinely mixed strongly co-Hopfian groups is rather complicated and does {\\it not} entirely depend on the structure of its maximal torsion subgroup. We also establish that a strongly co-Hopfian group is cotorsion exactly when it is algebraically compact and, particularly, a reduced (adjusted) cotorsion group is strongly co-Hopfian only when its maximal torsion subgroup is strongly co-Hopfian. Additionally, we demonstrate that a strongly co-Hopfian group is uniformly strongly co-Hopfian exactly when its maximal torsion subgroup is strongly co-Hopfian.",

    "title": "Stochastic Models of Resource Allocation in Chemical Reaction Networks",
    "abstract": "This paper analyses of a stochastic model of a chemical reaction network with three types of chemical species ${\\cal R}$, ${\\cal M}$ and ${\\cal U}$ that interact to transform a flow of external resources, the chemical species ${\\cal Q}$, to produce a product, the chemical species ${\\cal P}_r$. A regulation mechanism involving the sequestration of the chemical species ${\\cal R}$ when the flow of resources is too low is investigated. The original motivation of the study is of analyzing the qualitative properties of a key regulation mechanism of gene expression in biological cells, the {\\em stringent response}.\n  A scaling analysis of a Markov process in $\\N^5$ representing the state of the chemical reaction network is achieved. It is shown that, depending on the parameters of the model, there are, quite surprisingly, three possible asymptotic regimes. To each of them corresponds a stochastic averaging principle with a fast process expressed in terms of a network of $M/M/\\infty$ queues. One of these regimes, the optimal sequestration regime, does not seem to have been identified up to now. Under this regime, the input flow of resources is low but the state of the network is still acceptable in terms of unused macro-molecules, showing the remarkable efficiency of this regulation mechanism. The technical proofs of the main convergence results rely on a combination of coupling arguments, technical estimates of the solutions of SDEs, of sample paths of fast processes in particular, and the stability properties of some dynamical systems in $\\R^2$.",

Among their compactifications, there is a toric compactification that generalizes the standard Losev-Manin compactification to this higher-dimensional setting. Our main result identifies the fan of this toric compactification as a symmetric product of a nested fan, generalizing the classical connection between Losev-Manin spaces and the permutohedron to arbitrary dimension. More generally, we prove that the fans of all Gallardo-Routis compactifications that admit reduction maps from this Losev-Manin space are symmetric products of building sets. This shows that the combinatorics of these compactifications are controlled by coarsenings of the permutohedral fan that give rise to Hassett spaces.",

Progress toward this conjecture has been made by studying the connectedness of the graphs obtained from the action of the Vieta group on the nonzero mod $p$ solutions to the Markoff equation. In this paper, we use results on Pisano periods of the Fibonacci sequence to obtain explicit results on the connectedness of special points in this graph for primes $p$ where $p+1$ has large $2$-adic valuation. In particular, for Mersenne primes $p \\equiv \\pm 2 \\,(\\text{mod}\\, 5)$, we show that the special point $(1, 1, 1)$ which is fixed under reduction modulo $p$ lies in a component of this graph which is known to be connected.",
