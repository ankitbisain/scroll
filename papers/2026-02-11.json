    "title": "Beyond Free-Stream Preservation: Transport Polynomial Exactness for Moving-Mesh Methods under Arbitrary Mesh Motion",
    "abstract": "High-order moving-mesh methods can effectively reduce numerical diffusion, but their formal accuracy typically relies on the regularity of the mesh velocity. This dependency creates a fundamental conflict in the numerical solution of hyperbolic conservation laws, where solution-driven adaptation may induce nonsmooth mesh motion, thereby degrading convergence order. We introduce \\emph{transport polynomial exactness} (TPE($k$)), a mesh-motion-independent criterion that generalizes classical free-stream preservation (TPE(0)) to the exact advection of degree-$k$ polynomials. We show that the classical geometric conservation law (GCL) is insufficient to ensure TPE($k$) for $k \\ge 1$ due to mismatches in higher-order geometric moments. To resolve this, we propose \\emph{evolved geometric moments} (EGMs), obtained by solving auxiliary transport equations discretized compatibly with the physical variables. We rigorously prove that second-degree EGMs evolved via the third-order strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta (SSPRK3) method coincide with the exact geometric moments. This exactness arises from a \\emph{superconvergence} mechanism wherein SSPRK3 reduces to Simpson's rule for EGM evolution. Leveraging this result, we construct a third-order conservative finite-volume rezoning moving-mesh scheme. The scheme satisfies the TPE(2) property for \\emph{arbitrary mesh motion} and \\emph{any pseudo-time step size}, thereby naturally accommodating spatiotemporally discontinuous mesh velocity. Crucially, this \\emph{breaks the efficiency bottleneck} in the conventional advection-based remapping step and reduces the required pseudo-time levels from $\\mathcal{O}(h^{-1})$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ under bounded but discontinuous mesh velocity. Numerical experiments verify exact quadratic transport and stable third-order convergence under extreme mesh deformation, demonstrating substantial efficiency gains.",

We provide a series of experiments using both synthetic and real data, demonstrating striking speed-ups of the order 5x--20x compared to the non-skipped counterparts which have been so far the standard approach for efficiently solving these problems.

The operators are defined by the quadratic form method and are described by continuity across each shell together with the usual jump condition for the radial derivative. Using a boundary integral approach based on the free Green kernel and single--layer potentials, we derive an explicit resolvent representation for an arbitrary number of shells with bounded coupling strengths. This yields a concrete Kre\u012dn--type formula and a boundary operator whose noninvertibility characterizes the discrete spectrum, and it is compatible with a partial--wave reduction under rotational symmetry.\n  We then specialize to the two--shell case with constant couplings and obtain a detailed description of the negative spectrum. In particular, we show that the ground state (when it exists) lies in the $s$--wave sector and derive an explicit secular equation for bound states. For large shell separation, each bound level approaches the corresponding single--shell level with exponentially small corrections, while a genuine tunneling splitting appears when the single--shell levels are tuned to coincide. As a simple calibration, we relate the two--shell parameters to representative core--shell quantum dot scales. At the level of order--of--magnitude and qualitative trends, Type~I configurations yield a relatively strongly confined state, whereas Type~II configurations produce a comparatively shallow outer--shell state.",

This study is motivated by optimal sensor placement for linear inverse problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs). We consider measurement models where each sensor collects a single-snapshot measurement. This covers sensor placement for inverse problems governed by linear steady PDEs or evolution equations with final-in-time observations. It is well-known that in the finite-dimensional (discretized) formulations of such inverse problems, EIG is a monotone submodular function. This also entails a theoretical guarantee for greedy sensor placement in the discretized setting. We extend the result on submodularity of the EIG to the infinite-dimensional setting, proving that the approximation guarantee of greedy sensor placement remains valid in the infinite-dimensional limit. We also discuss computational considerations and present strategies that exploit problem structure and submodularity to yield an efficient implementation of the greedy procedure.",

Results show that the proposed method consistently outperforms standard Adam, achieving faster convergence and lower error in both regression and classification settings.",

We show that block arrivals exhibit stable exponential behavior across difficulty epochs, and that the proof-of-work process maintains a high-entropy search state that collapses discretely upon the discovery of a valid block. This entropy-based interpretation provides a mechanistic account of Bitcoin's non-continuous temporal structure. In a distributed network, however, entropy collapse is not completed instantaneously across all participants. Using empirical observations of temporary forks, we show that collapse completion unfolds over a finite propagation-bounded interval, while remaining rapid in practice.",

We then construct sequences of smooth upper and lower approximating matrix-valued functions, each of whose corresponding operators satisfies the principal eigenvalue existence condition. This approximation framework allows the principal spectrum point to effectively substitute for the principal eigenvalue in characterizing the global dynamics of the nonlinear system. Moreover, it facilitates the study of the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum point with respect to parameters under fairly general assumptions. Subsequently, for systems with both coupled and uncoupled nonlocal terms, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum point in terms of the dispersal rate, dispersal range, and frequency.

To solve these issues, we introduce a regularized version of geometric distribution functions and quantiles that are provably close to the usual geometric concepts and share their qualitative properties, both in the empirical and continuous case, while allowing for a much broader applicability of asymptotic results without any moment condition. We also show that any linear assignment of probability measures (such as the univariate distribution function), that is also translation- and orthogonal-equivariant, necessarily coincides with one of our regularized geometric distribution functions.",

Two natural definitions arise depending on whether rational multiples $(p,q)=(kp_n,kq_n),k\\geq 2$ which represent the same rational numbers as convergents, are allowed or excluded.

First, we rigorously study the CFL stability conditions for the explicit ADER-DG method, confirming results widely used in the literature while specifying their limitations. Moreover, we highlight under which conditions on the mesh velocity the ALE methods, constrained to a given CFL, are actually stable. Next, we extend the stability study to ADER-DG in the presence of degenerate spacetime elements, with zero size at the beginning and the end of the time step, but with a non zero spacetime volume. This kind of elements has been introduced in a series of articles on direct ALE methods by Gaburro et al. to connect via spacetime control volumes regenerated Voronoi tessellations after a topology change. Here, we imitate this behavior in 1d by fictitiously inserting degenerate elements in between two cells. Then, we show that over this degenerate spacetime geometry, both for the explicit and implicit ADER-DG, the CFL stability constraints remain the same as those for classical geometries, laying the theoretical foundations for their use in the context of ALE methods.",

We show that under the operational constraint of exceeding distortion $d$ with probability at most $\u03b5$, the minimum achievable rate at blocklength $n$ satisfies $R(n, d, \u03b5)=\\mathbb{R}_n(d)+\\sqrt{\\frac{\\mathbb{V}_n(d)}{n}}Q^{-1}(\u03b5)+O \\left(\\frac{\\log n}{n}\\right)$, where $Q^{-1}(\\cdot)$ is the inverse $Q$-function, while $\\mathbb{R}_n(d)$ and $\\mathbb{V}_n(d)$ are fundamental characteristics of the source computed using its $n$-letter joint distribution and the distortion measure, called the $n$th-order informational rate-distortion function and the source dispersion, respectively. Our result generalizes the existing dispersion result for abstract sources with i.i.d. components. It also sharpens and extends the only known dispersion result for a source with memory, namely, the scalar Gauss-Markov source. The key novel technical tool in our analysis is the point-mass product proxy measure, which enables the construction of typical sets.

    "title": "Directed Information: Estimation, Optimization and Applications in Communications and Causality",
    "abstract": "Directed information (DI) is an information measure that attempts to capture directionality in the flow of information from one random process to another. It is closely related to other causal influence measures, such as transfer entropy, Granger causality, and Pearl's causal framework. This monograph provides an overview of DI and its main application in information theory, namely, characterizing the capacity of channels with feedback and memory. We begin by reviewing the definitions of DI, its basic properties, and its relation to Shannon's mutual information. Next, we provide a survey of DI estimation techniques, ranging from classic plug-in estimators to modern neural-network-based estimators. Considering the application of channel capacity estimation, we describe how such estimators numerically optimize DI rate over a class of joint distributions on input and output processes. A significant part of the monograph is devoted to techniques to compute the feedback capacity of finite-state channels (FSCs). The feedback capacity of a strongly connected FSC involves the maximization of the DI rate from the channel input process to the output process. This maximization is performed over the class of causal conditioned probability input distributions. When the FSC is also unifilar, i.e., the next state is given by a time-invariant function of the current state and the new input-output symbol pair, the feedback capacity is the optimal average reward of an appropriately formulated Markov decision process (MDP). This MDP formulation has been exploited to develop several methods to compute exactly, or at least estimate closely, the feedback capacity of a unifilar FSC. This monograph describes these methods, starting from the value iteration algorithm, to Q-graph methods, and reinforcement learning algorithms that can handle large input and output alphabets.",

To investigate these phenomena, we utilize a modified version of the Schnakenberg model called the ligand internalisation (LI) model. In a one-dimensional domain, a linear relationship has been observed between the gene expression time delay and the time it takes for patterns to form. We extend the model to the two-dimensional domain and confirm that a similar relationship holds there as well. However, our exploration reveals a non-monotonic correlation between domain size and the time required for pattern emergence.\n  To unravel these dynamics, we consider a range of initial conditions, including random perturbations of the spatially homogeneous steady state and initial conditions from its unstable manifold. We compute a two-parameter chart of patterns with respect to time delay and domain size.",

Its class of fibrant objects is generated by the weakly Ding injective $R$-modules, a class of modules recently studied by Iacob. We give several characterizations of the fibrant modules, one being that they are the cycle modules of certain acyclic complexes of FP-injective (i.e., absolutely pure) $R$-modules. In the case that $R$ is a Ding-Chen ring, we show that they are precisely the modules appearing as cycles of acyclic complexes of FP-injectives. This leads to a new description of the stable module category of a Ding-Chen ring $R$, by way of modules we call Gorenstein FP-pro-injective. These are modules that appear as a cycle module of a totally acyclic complex of FP-projective-injective modules. As a completely separate application of the new model category method, we show that all complete cotorsion pairs, even non-hereditary ones, lift to abelian models for the derived category of a ring.",

They noted that if each of the quadratic irrationals $A$, $B$ and $C$ is replaced by their conjugates, that is, each number $a+b\\sqrt{61}$ is changed to $a-b\\sqrt{61}$, then the resulting series also converges to a rational multiple of $1/\u03c0$. They gave several other examples of quadratic irrational series for $1/\u03c0$, and noted that the conjugate series converges to another rational multiple of $1/\u03c0$ or in some cases the conjugate series diverges.\n  The purpose of this work is to provide an explanation and classification of such series. Our classification includes Ramanujan's 17 original series, as well as series of the Borweins, Chudnovskys, Sato and others. We extend the classification to genus-zero subgroups $\u0393_0(\\ell)+$, that is, for each $\\ell \\in \\big\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,36,38,39,41,42,44,45,46,47,49,50,51,54,55,56,59,60,62,66,69,70, 71,78,87,92,94,95,105,110,119\\big\\}$ we calculate the Hauptmoduls, associated weight two modular forms, and the corresponding rational and real quadratic irrational series for $1/\u03c0$.\n  The classification reveals many interrelations among the different series.

    "abstract": "We consider the compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\\geq2$), a classical model for barotropic compressible flows coupled with a self-consistent electrostatic potential. We show that the electrostatic coupling has a significant impact on the long-time dynamics of solutions due to its underlying Klein-Gordon structure. As a first result, we prove the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem with initial data near equilibrium in the full-frequency $L^{p}$-type critical Besov space \\emph{without relying on hyperbolic symmetrization}. Compared with the Poisson-free case studied in several milestone works [Charve and Danchin, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 198 (2010), 233-271; Chen, Miao and Zhang, Commun. Pure Appl. Math., 63 (2010), 1173-1224; Haspot, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 202 (2011), 427-460], we remove the extra $L^{2}$ assumption in low frequencies and extend the admissible choice of $p$ to the sharp range $1\\leq p<2d$. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first result in compressible fluids that allows the initial velocity field to be highly oscillatory across all frequencies.\n  Furthermore, stemming from the Poisson coupling, the density and velocity exhibit distinct low-frequency behaviors. Motivated by this feature, we propose a general $L^p$-type low-frequency assumption and establish the optimal convergence rates of global solutions toward equilibrium. For a broad class of indices, this assumption yields faster decay than those obtained under the classical $L^1$ framework. To this end, we develop a time-weighted energy method, which is of interest and enables us to capture maximal decay estimates without additional smallness of initial data.",

In particular, we show that if $G$ is a $t$-diamond-free chordal graph (in particular, a block graph), then $\\mathsf{CF}_t(G)$ is $(t-2)$-decomposable and hence shellable. We also investigate how graph modifications via clique attachments influence shellability.

    "abstract": "We prove that for any test category $A$, in the sense of Grothendieck, satisfying a compatibility condition between homology equivalences and weak equivalences of presheaves, the homotopy category of abelian presheaves on $A$ is equivalent to the non-negative derived category of abelian groups. This provides a homotopical generalization of the Dold-Kan correspondence for presheaves of abelian groups over a wide range of test categories. This equivalence of homotopy categories comes from a Quillen equivalence for a model structure on abelian presheaves that we introduce under these conditions. We then show that this result applies to Joyal's category $\u0398$.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the input-to-state stabilization problem for an ordinary differential equation (ODE) cascaded by parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) in the presence of Dirichlet-Robin boundary disturbances, as well as in-domain disturbances. For the cascaded system with a Dirichlet pointwise interconnection, the ODE takes the value of a Robin boundary condition at the ODE-PDE interface as its direct input, and the PDE is driven by a Dirichlet boundary input at the opposite end. We first employ the backstepping method to design a boundary controller and to decouple the cascaded system. This decoupling facilitates independent stability analysis of the PDE and ODE systems sequentially. Then, to address the challenges posed by Dirichlet boundary disturbances to the application of the classical Lyapunov method, we utilize the generalized Lyapunov method to establish the ISS in the max-norm for the cascaded system involving Dirichlet boundary disturbances and two other types of disturbances. The obtained result indicates that even in the presence of different types of disturbances, ISS analysis can still be conducted within the framework of Lyapunov stability theory. For the well-posedness of the target system, it is conducted by using the technique of lifting and the semigroup method. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme and ISS properties for a cascaded system with different disturbances.",

    "title": "A Lions' type formula for some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of fractional harmonic functions",
    "abstract": "In \\cite{Lions}, J. L. Lions considered a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of harmonic functions on a regular domain with Sobolev traces and obtained a formula that expresses the kernel of this space as an integral on the boundary of some derivatives of the Green function associated with the Laplace operator and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. This result was simplified and extended later by Englis, Lukkassen, Peetre, and Persson in \\cite{ELPL} to more general elliptic systems of even orders. In particular, they emphasized that the resemblance between Lions' type formula and the Hadamard variational formula only appears when the operator is of order $2$. In this paper, we investigate some RKHS of $a$-harmonic functions, where $a$ in $(0,1)$ refers to a fractional exponent of the Laplace operator. For such fractional order pseudo-differential operators, the local nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem can be addressed by means of some $a$-transmission Sobolev spaces, which were introduced by H\u00f6rmander in the sixties and recently developed by Grubb in a series of papers. We deduce from these works a fractional Poisson formula, which is applied to obtain a Lions' type formula. We observe, in particular, that despite the order of the operator not being $2$, this formula resembles the Hadamard variational formula that we prove in the companion paper \\cite{sidy-franck_1}. As a complementary remark, we observe that for a family of RKHS associated with the steady Stokes system, a second order system, there is also a Lions' type formula for their two-point kernels, which turn out not to be similar to the corresponding Hadamard variation formula.",

    "abstract": "Given a simple graph $G$, its line graph, denoted by $L(G)$, is obtained by representing each edge of $G$ as a vertex, with two vertices in $L(G)$ adjacent whenever the corresponding edges in $G$ share a common endpoint. By applying the line graph operation repeatedly, we obtain higher order line graphs, denoted by $L^{r}(G)$. In other words, $L^{0}(G) = G$, and for any integer $r \\ge 1$, $L^{r}(G) = L(L^{r-1}(G))$.\n  Given a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, we wish to efficiently find out (i) if $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path, (ii) the value of $\u0394(L^k(G))$. Note that the size of a higher order line graph could be much larger than that of $G$.\n  For the first question, we show that for a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges the largest $k$ where $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path satisfies $k = \\mathcal O(nm)$. We also design an $\\mathcal{O}(n^2m)$-time algorithm to output all $k$ such that $L^k(G)$ has an Euler path.\n  For the second question, we study the growth of maximum degree of $L^k(G)$, $k \\ge 0$. It is easy to calculate $\u0394(L^k(G))$ when $G$ is a path, cycle or a claw. Any other connected graph is called a prolific graph and we denote the set of all prolific graphs by $\\mathcal G$. We extend the works of Hartke and Higgins to show that for any prolific graph $G$, there exists a constant rational number $dgc(G)$ and an integer $k_0$ such that for all $k \\ge k_0$, $\u0394(L^k(G)) = dgc(G) \\cdot 2^{k-4} + 2$. We show that $\\{dgc(G) \\mid G \\in \\mathcal G\\}$ has first, second, third, fourth and fifth minimums, namely, $c_1 = 3$, $c_2 = 4$, $c_3 = 5.5$, $c_4 = 6$ and $c_5=7$; the third minimum stands out surprisingly from the other four. Moreover, for $i \\in \\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$, we provide a complete characterization of $\\mathcal G_i = \\{dgc(G) = c_i \\mid G \\in \\mathcal G \\}$. Apart from this, we show that the set $\\{dgc(G) \\mid G \\in \\mathcal G, 7 < dgc(G) < 8\\}$ is countably infinite.",

By respectively constructing the equivalent transparent boundary conditions of acoustic and elastic waves simultaneously, the well-posedness and exponential convergence of the solution to the associated truncated PML problem are established. The finite element method is applied to solve the PML problem of acoustic-elastic interaction. To address the singularity caused by the non-smooth surface of the elastic body, we establish a residual-type a posteriori error estimate and develop an adaptive PML finite element algorithm.

    "abstract": "The Penrose triangle, staircase, and related ``impossible objects'' have long been understood as related to first cohomology $H^1$: the obstruction to extending locally consistent interpretations around a loop. This paper develops a cohomological hierarchy for a class of visual paradoxes. Restricting to systems built from \\emph{bistable} elements -- components admitting exactly two local states, such as the Necker cube's forward/backward orientations, a gear's clockwise/counterclockwise spin, or a rhombic tiling corner's convex/concave interpretation -- allows the use of $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients throughout, reducing obstruction theory to parity arithmetic. This reveals a hierarchy of paradox classes from $H^0$ through $H^2$, refined at each degree by the relative/absolute distinction, ranging from ambiguity through impossibility to inaccessibility. A discrete Stokes theorem emerges as the central tool: at each degree, the connecting homomorphism of relative cohomology promotes boundary data to interior obstruction, providing the uniform mechanism by which paradoxes ascend the hierarchy.\n  Three paradigmatic systems -- Necker cube fields, gear meshes, and rhombic tilings -- are studied in detail. Throughout, we pair cohomology with imagery and animation. To illuminate the underlying structure, we introduce the \\emph{Method of Monodromic Apertures}, an animation technique that reveals monodromy through a configuration space of local sections.",

    "abstract": "We establish both local and global bifurcation results for traveling periodic solutions of the one-dimensional two-species Vlasov-Poisson equation. These solutions consist of strip-like regions of ions and electrons in phase space that propagate coherently and emerge from spatially homogeneous, velocity-dependent equilibrium layers. Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well.",

    "title": "Composita Stability Theorems for Enhanced Koszul Properties in Galois Cohomology",
    "abstract": "We investigate how enhanced Koszul properties of Galois cohomology behave under composita of fields. Given fields $K_1$ and $K_2$ containing $\u03bc_p$, with intersection $k$ and compositum $K = K_1K_2$, we formulate an abstract composita stability theorem: under a pro-$p$ amalgam decomposition $G_K \\cong G_{K_1} *_{G_k} G_{K_2}$ of maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups, and natural Mayer-Vietoris compatibility assumptions on the mod-$p$ cohomology rings $H^\\bullet(G_{K_1},\\mathbb F_p)$, $H^\\bullet(G_{K_2},\\mathbb F_p)$, and $H^\\bullet(G_k,\\mathbb F_p)$, the quadratic presentation of $H^\\bullet(G_K,\\mathbb F_p)$ arises from a fiber-product construction on degree-$1$ generators and quadratic relations. Assuming stability of universal Koszulity under this quadratic gluing, we obtain that universal Koszulity of $H^\\bullet(G_{K_1},\\mathbb F_p)$ and $H^\\bullet(G_{K_2},\\mathbb F_p)$ implies universal Koszulity of $H^\\bullet(G_K,\\mathbb F_p)$. As a concrete application, we prove a composita stability theorem for certain Pythagorean fields whose maximal pro-$2$ Galois groups decompose as free pro-$2$ products of Demu\u0161kin groups and free factors. For suitable composita $K = K_1K_2$ of such fields, the mod-$2$ Galois cohomology ring $H^\\bullet(G_K(2),\\mathbb F_2)$ remains quadratic and universally Koszul. This provides large classes of fields, built from local, global, and Pythagorean base fields by admissible extensions and composita, whose maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups have universally Koszul cohomology, and yields inverse Galois obstructions: any finitely generated pro-$p$ group with nonquadratic or non-universally Koszul mod-$p$ cohomology cannot occur as the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group of a field in these families.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of parameter estimation from a generalized linear model with a random design matrix that is orthogonally invariant in law. Such a model allows the design have an arbitrary distribution of singular values and only assumes that its singular vectors are generic. It is a vast generalization of the i.i.d. Gaussian design typically considered in the theoretical literature, and is motivated by the fact that real data often have a complex correlation structure so that methods relying on i.i.d. assumptions can be highly suboptimal. Building on the paradigm of spectrally-initialized iterative optimization, this paper proposes optimal spectral estimators and combines them with an approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm, establishing rigorous performance guarantees for these two algorithmic steps. Both the spectral initialization and the subsequent AMP meet existing conjectures on the fundamental limits to estimation -- the former on the optimal sample complexity for efficient weak recovery, and the latter on the optimal errors. Numerical experiments suggest the effectiveness of our methods and accuracy of our theory beyond orthogonally invariant data.",

    "title": "Existence of Multilateral Nash equilibria for families of games",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces two fundamentally new concepts to game theory: multilateral Nash equilibria and families of games. Starting with non-cooperative games, we show how these notions together seamlessly integrate into and naturally extend the classical theory, and simultaneously enable us to prove a powerful (multilateral) Nash equilibrium existence result with minimal assumptions on the game. Classically, a Nash equilibrium is a global strategy such that whichever player unilaterally deviates from the equilibrium, also reduces his own profit. For a k-lateral Nash equilibrium we now require that whichever group of k players collectively changes their strategies, also reduces all of the deviating players' profits. In this way, we obtain a filtration of equilibria, where the higher-lateral equilibria are less frequent. Furthermore, we derive an existence criterion for multilateral Nash equilibria and demonstrate how it reflects the increasing rarity of higher-lateral equilibria. Additionally, we show that some classical games have higher-lateral Nash equilibria, which in every case reveal the structure of these games from a new point of view. A family of games is a parameterized collection of non-cooperative games, where the parameter affects every aspect of the game. Typically, we assume that this dependence is continuous, thereby introducing a new structure. That way, we can avoid analyzing the games one at a time, and instead treat the family as a whole. This allows the parameter to take a central role in our theory, and shifts our attention from seeking a special strategy to searching for a special game with preferred strategies. Our main result proves the existence of a multilateral equilibrium in a family of games, maintaining minimalistic assumptions on the games individually. Surprisingly, the clique covering number of the Kneser graph makes a central appearance.",

The corresponding posterior mean is shown to converge uniformly at the posterior contraction rate in the sense of satisfying a concentration inequality. Distinguishability for bounded alternatives separated from a composite null hypothesis at the posterior contraction rate is established using infimum plug-in tests based on the posterior mean and also on maximum a posteriori estimators. The results are applied to a class of inverse problems governed by ordinary differential equation initial value problems that is widely used in pharmacokinetics. For this class, uniform posterior contraction rates are proven and then used to establish distinguishability.",

    "abstract": "We study discrete-time, discrete-state multistate Markov models from the perspective of algebraic statistics. These models are widely studied in event history analysis, and are characterized by the state space, the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. A finite path under the multistate Markov model is a particular set of states occupied at finite time instances $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$. The main goal of this paper is to establish a bridge between event history analysis and algebraic statistics. The joint probabilities of finite paths in these models have a natural monomial parametrization in terms of the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. We study the polynomial relations among joint path probabilities. When the statistical constraints on the parameters are disregarded, nonhomogeneous multistate Markov models of arbitrary order can be viewed as slices of decomposable hierarchical models. This yields a complete description of their vanishing ideals as toric ideals generated by explicit families of binomials. Moreover, the variety of this vanishing ideal equals the nonhomogeneous multistate Markov model on the probability simplex. In contrast, homogeneous multistate Markov models exhibit different algebraic behavior, as time homogeneity imposes additional polynomial relations, leading to vanishing ideals that are strictly larger than in the nonhomogeneous case. We also derive families of binomial relations that vanish on homogeneous multistate Markov models. We investigate maximum likelihood estimation from statistical and algebraic perspectives. For nonhomogeneous models, classical and algebraic formulas agree; in the homogeneous case, the algebraic approach is more complex. Lastly, we provide data applications where we demonstrate the statistical theory to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters under specific multistate Markov models.",

This reveals a discrepancy between the local quadratic metric and the global $L^n$ structure. We axiomatically define an \"Information-Geometric Fermat Solution,\" postulating that the lattice structure must maintain \"dual lattice consistency\" under the Legendre transform. We prove the non-existence of such structures for $n \\ge 3$. Through the Poisson Summation Formula and Hausdorff-Young Inequality, we demonstrate that the Fourier transform induces an alteration of the function family ($L^n \\to L^q$, where $1/n + 1/q = 1$), rendering dual lattice consistency analytically impossible.

    "abstract": "Stochastic minimax optimization on Riemannian manifolds has recently attracted significant attention due to its broad range of applications, such as robust training of neural networks and robust maximum likelihood estimation. Existing optimization methods for these problems typically require selecting stepsizes based on prior knowledge of specific problem parameters, such as Lipschitz-type constants and (geodesic) strong concavity constants. Unfortunately, these parameters are often unknown in practice. To overcome this issue, we develop single-loop adaptive methods that automatically adjust stepsizes using cumulative Riemannian (stochastic) gradient norms. We first propose a deterministic single-loop Riemannian adaptive gradient descent ascent method and show that it attains an $\u03b5$-stationary point within $O(\u03b5^{-2})$ iterations. This deterministic method is of independent interest and lays the foundation for our subsequent stochastic method. In particular, we propose the Riemannian stochastic adaptive gradient descent ascent method, which finds an $\u03b5$-stationary point in $O(\u03b5^{-6})$ iterations. Under additional second-order smoothness, this iteration complexity is further improved to $O(\u03b5^{-4})$, which even outperforms the corresponding complexity result in Euclidean space. Some numerical experiments on real-world applications are conducted, including the regularized robust maximum likelihood estimation problem, and the robust training of neural networks with orthonormal weights. The results are encouraging and demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptivity in practice.",

Furthermore, we show a correspondence with indecomposable transfinite sequences with finite range, over elements of the wqo $Q$, of length less than $\u03c9^\u03c9$. Nash-Williams proved that arbitrary transfinite sequences with finite range are also well-quasi-ordered, but there are no known methods to extract bounds on the maximal order type from the proof. More concrete proofs for sequences of length less than $\u03b1$ for some $\u03b1< \u03c9^\u03c9$ were given by Erd\u0151s and Rado.

The P-HAN transition is investigated using a simplified 3D Ericksen-Leslie system. We find the thickness threshold of the P-HAN transition. If the thickness of the nematic layer exceeds this threshold, there is a global-in-time suitable weak solution converging exponentially to a nontrivial equilibrium state as time tends to infinity.

Under mild homological assumptions, we prove that such properties of these tensor products impose strong structural constraints on \\( M \\), often forcing it to be free. These results generalize classical theorems of Auslander beyond the regular case and contribute to the broader understanding of rigidity phenomena in commutative algebra.\n  The second part of the paper is devoted to the dimension and support of Ext-modules, particularly \\( {Ext}^i_R(M, R) \\) for critical values of i, when \\( M \\) has finite projective dimension. We establish sharp bounds on their Krull dimensions, analyze their behavior for prime and equidimensional modules, and relate these findings to the grade conjecture and other homological conjectures. Applications include new cases of a question of Jorgensen, which asks whether \\( {pd}(M) < i \\) whenever \\({Ext}^i_R(M, M) = 0 \\) and M has finite projective dimension over a complete intersection ring.\n  Finally, we examine the projective dimension of prime ideals in rings that fail chain conditions.

We formulate the collision-streaming evolution of the LBM as a compact time-marching scheme and rigorously establish its stability under low Mach number conditions. This unified formulation eliminates the need for classical measurement at each time step, enabling a systematic and fully quantum implementation. Building upon this representation, we investigate two distinct quantum algorithmic approaches. The first is a time-marching quantum algorithm realized through sequential evolution operators, for which we provide a detailed implementation-including block-encoding and dilating unitarization-along with a full complexity analysis. The second employs a quantum linear systems algorithm, which encodes the entire time evolution into a single global linear system. We demonstrate that both methods achieve comparable asymptotic time complexities. The proposed algorithms are validated through numerical simulations of benchmark problems in one and two dimensions. This work provides a systematic, measurement-free pathway for the quantum simulation of advection-diffusion processes via the lattice Boltzmann paradigm.",

When $A(q)$ is modular (typically an $\u03b7$--quotient), this yields (quasi)modular forms whose coefficients can be projected to arithmetic progressions and certified modulo primes by a Sturm bound, giving an effective pipeline for detecting and proving Ramanujan--type congruences for frequency moments.\n  For ordinary partitions we recover and certify several congruences for odd moments in nonzero residue classes (e.g.\\ $M_3(7n+5)\\equiv 0\\pmod7$ and $M_3(11n+6)\\equiv 0\\pmod{11}$).

Due to an increasing demand for explanations, this may involve counterfactual queries besides the typically considered factual queries. In this work, we consider linear models and three types of queries: factual, counterfactual, and robust counterfactual. First, for an arbitrary set of queries, we derive novel mathematical formulations for the classification regions for which the decision of the unknown model is known, without recovering any of the model parameters. Second, we derive bounds on the number of queries needed to extract the model's parameters for (robust) counterfactual queries under arbitrary norm-based distances. We show that the full model can be recovered using just a single counterfactual query when differentiable distance measures are employed. In contrast, when using polyhedral distances for instance, the number of required queries grows linearly with the dimension of the data space. For robust counterfactuals, the latter number of queries doubles. Consequently, the applied distance function and robustness of counterfactuals have a significant impact on the model's security.",

    "abstract": "Outer-approximation-based branch-and-bound is a common algorithmic framework for solving MINLPs (mixed-integer nonlinear programs) to global optimality, with branching variable selection critically influencing overall performance. In modern global MINLP solvers, it is unclear whether branching on fractional integer variables should be prioritized over spatial branching on variables, potentially continuous, that show constraint violations, with different solvers following different defaults. We address this question using a data-driven approach. Based on a test set of hundreds of heterogeneous public and industrial MINLP instances, we train linear and random forest regression models to predict the relative speedup of the FICO(R) Xpress Global solver when using a branching rule that always prioritizes variables with violated integralities versus a mixed rule, allowing for early spatial branches.\n  We introduce a practical evaluation methodology that measures the effect of the learned model directly in terms of the shifted geometric mean runtime. Using only four features derived from strong branching and the nonlinear structure, our linear regression model achieves an 8-9% reduction in geometric-mean solving time for the Xpress solver, with over 10% improvement on hard instances. We also analyze a random regression forest model. Experiments across solver versions show that a model trained on Xpress 9.6 still yields significant improvements on Xpress 9.8 without retraining.\n  Our results demonstrate how regression models can successfully guide the branching-rule selection and improve the performance of a state-of-the-art commercial MINLP solver.",

These bounds decompose naturally across spherical harmonic subspaces. Guided by this decomposition, we construct a family of spectral algorithms based on harmonic tensor unfolding that sequentially recover the latent directions and (nearly) achieve these SQ and LDP lower bounds. Depending on the choice of harmonic degree sequence, these estimators can realize a broad range of trade-offs between sample and runtime complexity.

We show that this creates a negative feedback loop, which we call \\textit{Increasing Gap Dynamics} (IGD): when a server is assigned a spatial gap forms, which is more likely to attract new users that further widen the gap. The simplest version of our model is a one-dimensional circle, for which we derive analytical results showing that the system converges to an inefficient equilibrium, worse than both balanced and fully random distributions of servers. We prove that an optimal assignment policy always matches the user to one of its two neighbouring servers so that long gaps tend to widen. Hence, the IGD persists even when assigning optimally rather than greedily. In two dimensions, the appearance of the IGD is illustrated through simulations on a square region. Finally, simulations of a proper ride-hailing system using real data from Manhattan confirms that the IGD arises and that it is responsible for the appearance of the well-known Wild Goose Chase.",

We identify a key quantity that, for each method, describes how the performance degrades as the step size becomes too large. For convex problems, we show that this quantity directly impacts the suboptimality bound of the method. Most importantly, our analysis provides direct theoretical evidence that adaptive step-size methods, such as SPS or NGN, are more robust than SGD. This allows us to quantify the advantage of these adaptive methods beyond empirical evaluation. Finally, we show through experiments that our theoretical bound qualitatively mirrors the actual performance as a function of the step size, even for nonconvex problems.",

    "abstract": "Existence of solutions to doubly nonlinear equations in reflexive Banach spaces is established by resorting to a global-in-time variational approach inspired by De Giorgi's principle, which characterizes the associated flows as null-minimizers of a suitable energy-dissipation functional defined on trajectories. In contrast to the celebrated minimizing movements scheme, the proposed strategy does not rely on any time-discretization or iterative constructions. Instead, it provides a direct method based on the relaxation of the problem in spaces of measures, constrained by the continuity equation: in this procedure, no gap is introduced due to the Ambrosio's superposition principle.\n  Within this weak convex framework, the validity of the null-minimization property is recovered through two further steps. First, a careful application of the Von Neumann minimax theorem yields an identification of the dual problem as a supremum over the set of smooth and bounded cylinder functions, solving an Hamilton-Jacobi-type inequality. Secondly, a suitable \"backward boundedness\" property of solutions to such Hamilton-Jacobi system gives a proper bound of the dual problem, ensuring that the minimum value of the original functional is actually zero.\n  The proposed strategy naturally extends to non-autonomous equations, encompassing time- and space-dependent dissipation potentials and time-dependent potential energies.",

In this paper, we present asymptotic analysis of the Gaussian kernel matrix in high dimension under a statistical model of noisy data. The main result is a nice combination of Karoui's asymptotic analysis with procedures of constrained low rank matrix approximations. More specifically, Karouli clarified an important asymptotic structure of the Gaussian kernel matrix, leading to strong consistency of the eigenvectors, though the eigenvalues are inconsistent. This paper focuses on the above results and presents a consistent estimator with the use of the smallest eigenvalue, whenever the target kernel matrix tends to low rank in the asymptotic regime. Importantly, asymptotic analysis is given under a statistical model representing partial noise. Although a naive estimator is inconsistent, applying an optimization method for low rank approximations with constraints, we overcome the difficulty caused by the inconsistency, resulting in a new estimator with strong consistency in rank deficient cases.",

Combining the theories of pseudomonotone operators with complementary systems, we prove that this eigenvalue problem has an infinite number of eigenfunctions and that the corresponding sequence of eigenvalues tends to infinity.

To bridge this gap, the literature has proposed strongly quasar-convex functions as an intermediate non-convex class, for which accelerated bounds have been suggested to persist. We show that this is not true in general: the additional structure of strong quasar-convexity does not suffice to guaranty better worst-case bounds for momentum compared to gradient descent. As an alternative, we study PL functions under an aiming condition that measures how well the descent direction points toward a minimizer. This perspective clarifies the geometric ingredient enabling provable acceleration by momentum when minimizing PL functions.",

For uniform random geometric graph, where the nodes are uniformly distributed in a space, the friendship paradox index is asymptotically equal to $1/4$. On the contrary, in nonuniform random geometric graphs, the nonuniform node distribution leads to distinct limiting properties for the index. In the relatively sparse regime, the friendship paradox index is still asymptotically equal to $1/4$, the same as in the uniform case. In the intermediate sparse regime, however, the index converges in probability to $1/4$ plus a constant that is explicitly dependent on the node distribution. Finally, in the relatively dense case, the index diverges to infinity as the graph size increases. Our results highlight the sharp contrast between the uniform case and its nonuniform counterpart.",

    "title": "Quantitative estimates for the forced Navier-Stokes equations and applications",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove a localisation of a slightly supercritical (Orlicz) regularity criterion for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This is a refinement to the recent partial positive answer to Tao's conjecture [Tao21] as given in [BP21b]. The proof requires new quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equations, where the forcing is induced by the localisation. A by-product of these new estimates is an application to the Boussinesq equations, where we prove a quantitative blow-up rate for the critical $L^3$ norm of the velocity. We prove these quantitative estimates using Carleman inequalities as in [Tao21], and subsequently in [BP21a], with an additional forcing term. An obstacle to doing this is that, in the Carleman inequalities, the forcing term is amplified on large scales. Additionally, the low regularity of the forcing requires the addition of Caccioppoli-type estimates to deal with the Carleman inequalities appropriately.",

The overarching theme is that, while not Koszul (except for some small values of $n$), these rings have homological properties that extend those of Koszul rings. We establish that finitely generated modules over these rings have rational Poincar\u00e9 series and we give concrete formulas for the Poincar\u00e9 series of $\\sf{k}$ over both $A$ and $R$. We also show that $A$ has minimal rate and its Yoneda algebra $\\text{Ext}_A(\\sf{k},\\sf{k})$ is generated by its elements of degrees $1$ and $2$. While the graded Betti numbers of $R$ and $A$ over the polynomial ring are not known when $n$ is odd, our approach provides bounds and yields values for two of these Betti numbers, showing in particular that $R$ is level.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes the asymptotic error distribution of the tamed Euler method for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with a coupled monotonicity condition, that is, the limit distribution of the corresponding normalized error process. Specifically, for SDEs driven by multiplicative noise, we first propose a tamed Euler method parameterized by $\u03b1\\in (0, 1]$ and establish that its strong convergence rate is $\u03b1\\wedge\\frac{1}{2}$. Notably, $\u03b1$ can take arbitrary positive values by adjusting the regularization coefficient without altering the strong convergence rate. We then derive the asymptotic error distribution for this tamed Euler method. Further, we infer from the limit equation that among the tamed Euler method of strong order $\\frac{1}{2}$, the one with $\u03b1= \\frac{1}{2}$ yields the largest mean-square error after a long time, while those of $\u03b1>\\frac{1}{2}$ share a unified asymptotic error distribution. In addition, our analysis is also extended to SDEs with additive noise and similar conclusions are obtained. Additional treatments are required to accommodate super-linearly growing coefficients, a feature that distinguishes our analysis on the asymptotic error distribution from established results.",

Statist.): in each observation (batch), a random sample of $M$ i.i.d. point pairs $ ((X_i,Y_i))_{i=1}^M$ is drawn from a joint distribution with density $p(x,y)$, but we can observe only the unordered multisets $(X_i)_{i=1}^M$ and $(Y_i)_{i=1}^M$ separately; that is, the pairing information is lost. For large $M$, inferring $p$ from a single observation has been shown to be essentially impossible. In this paper, we propose a parametric method based on a pseudo-log-likelihood to estimate $p$ from $N$ i.i.d. broken sample batches, and we prove a fast convergence rate in $N$ for our estimator that is uniform in $M$, under mild assumptions.",

    "abstract": "A matrix $M$ over the finite field $ \\mathbb{F}_q $ is called \\emph{maximum distance separable} (MDS) if all of its square submatrices are non-singular. These MDS matrices are very important in cryptography and coding theory because they provide strong data protection and help spread information efficiently. In this paper, we introduce a new type of matrix called a \\emph{consta-$g$-circulant matrix}, which extends the idea of $g$-circulant matrices. These matrices come from a linear transformation defined by the polynomial\n  $\n  h(x) = x^m - \u03bb+ \\sum_{i=0}^{m-1} h_i x^i\n  $\n  over $ \\mathbb{F}_q $. We find the upper bound of such matrices exist and give conditions to check when they are invertible. This helps us know when they are MDS matrices. If the polynomial $ x^m - \u03bb$ factors as\n  $\n  x^m - \u03bb= \\prod_{i=1}^{t} f_i(x)^{e_i},\n  $\n  where each \\( f_i(x) \\) is irreducible, then the number of invertible consta-$g$-circulant matrices is\n  $\n  N \\cdot \\prod_{i=1}^{t} \\left( q^{\u00b0f_i} - 1 \\right),\n  $\n  where $r$ is the multiplicative order of $\u03bb$, and \\( N \\) is the number of integers \\( k \\) such that\n  $\n  0 \\leq k < \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m - 1}{r} \\right\\rfloor + 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\gcd(1 + rk, m) = 1.\n  $\n  This formula help us to reduce the number of cases to check whether such matrices is MDS. Moreover, we give complete characterization of $g$-circulant MDS matrices of order 3 and 4. Additionally, inspired by skew polynomial rings, we construct a new variant of $g$-circulant matrix. In the last, we provide some examples related to our findings.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces and studies split two-sided 2-fibrations and locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations, using a formal categorical approach. We generalise Street's notion of split two-sided fibration internal to a 2-category to one internal to a sesquicategory. Given a sesquicategory we construct a virtual double category whose horizontal (loose) morphisms are its internal split two-sided fibrations. Specialising to the sesquicategory of lax natural transformations we obtain the virtual double category of split two-sided 2-fibrations, which we study in detail. We then restrict to the sub-virtual double category of locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations and show that therein the usual Yoneda 2-functors satisfy a double-categorical formal notion of Yoneda morphism, which formally captures universal properties similar to those satisfied by the morphisms comprising a Yoneda structure on a 2-category. As a consequence we obtain a 'two-sided Grothendieck correspondence' of locally discrete split two-sided 2-fibrations $A \\nrightarrow B$ and 2-functors $B \\to Cat^{A^{op}}$. Restricting to $A = 1$, the terminal 2-category, we improve Buckley and Lambert's 'Grothendieck correspondence' for locally discrete split op-2-fibrations by extending the sense in which it is functorial.",

The model couples morphogen dynamics with tissue mechanics via a positive feedback loop: mechanical stretching enhances morphogen production, while morphogen concentration modulates tissue elasticity. Global strain conservation implements a nonlocal inhibitory effect, realizing a mechanochemical variant of the local activation--long-range inhibition mechanism. For exponential elasticity-morphogen coupling, the system admits a variational formulation. We prove existence of nonconstant steady states for small diffusion and uniqueness of the homogeneous state for large diffusion. Linear stability analysis shows that only unimodal patterns are stable, while multimodal solutions are unstable. Bifurcation analysis reveals subcritical and supercritical pitchforks, with fold bifurcations generating bistable regimes. Our results demonstrate that mechanochemical feedback provides a robust mechanism for single-peaked pattern formation without requiring a second diffusible inhibitor.",

As many classical techniques from discrepancy theory seem to fail in this setting, including linear algebraic methods like the Beck-Fiala Theorem [Discrete Appl. Math '81], it remains widely open whether comparable non-additive bounds can be achieved.\n  Towards a better understanding of non-additive discrepancy, we study coverage functions in a sparse setting comparable to the classical Beck-Fiala Theorem. Our setting generalizes the additive Beck-Fiala setting, rank functions of partition matroids, and edge coverage in graphs. More precisely, assuming each of the $n$ items covers only $t$ elements across all functions, we prove a constructive discrepancy bound that is polynomial in $t$, the number of colors $k$, and $\\log n$.",

We establish a comparison principle between classical strict supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions of the DPP, which yields stability results under minimal and natural hypotheses. As a consequence, we prove existence of viscosity solutions of the DPP and their convergence to viscosity solutions of a PDE that is consistent with the underlying approximation scheme. Moreover, we show that solutions of the limiting PDE admit an asymptotic expansion encoded by the approximation operator.
