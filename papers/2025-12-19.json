Furthermore, the condition for persistence also implies the attractiveness, that is, the existence of a bounded solution that attracts all the others. As a special case, when the nutrient supply is $\u03c9$-periodic, the picture is complete: the condition for persistence implies the existence of an attractive non-trivial $\u03c9$-periodic solution, while non-persistence implies extinction.",

This complicated five-component model is reduced to a three-component diffusive Lotka-Volterra system with convection by introducing a stream function. The system obtained is examined by the classical Lie method. A complete Lie symmetry classification is derived via a rigorous algorithm. In particular, it is proved that the widest Lie algebras of invariance occur when the stream function generate a linear velocity field. The most interesting cases (from the symmetry and applicability point of view) are further studied in order to derive exact solutions. A wide range of exact solutions are constructed for radially-symmetric stream functions. These solutions include time-dependent and radially symmetric solutions as well as more complicated solutions expressed in terms of the Weierstrass function. It was shown that some of exact solutions can be used for demonstration of spatiotemporal evolution of concentrations corresponding to two reactants and their product.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) considers a fully-connected network of $K$ users, where each pair of users can communicate bidirectionally over an error-free channel. Each user holds a private input, and the goal is for each user to compute the sum of all inputs without revealing any additional information, even in the presence of collusion among up to $T$ users. Traditional DSA typically requires large key sizes to protect all information except for the input sum and the information of colluding users. To mitigate the source keys overhead, we study decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints. In this setting, the inputs of a predefined collection of user subsets, called the \\emph{security set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$, must be protected from another predefined collection, the \\emph{collusion set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$. For an arbitrary security set $\\mathcal{S}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$ and an arbitrary collusion set $\\mathcal{T}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$, we characterize the optimal communication and source key rates. A key contribution of this work is the characterization of the optimal source key rate, i.e., the minimum number of key bits per input bit that must be shared among users for decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints to be feasible. In general, this characterization reduces to solving a linear program.",

We use the framework of adelic heights established by Favre and Rivera-Letelier and we construct a $p$-adic analog for the area measure on a disk in $\\mathbb{C}$. For areal Weil heights we prove an analog of Kronecker's theorem, which characterizes their small points and essential minima. Furthermore, we determine equidistribution theorems for areal Weil heights. In some cases, they have a unique limiting distribution for small points, while in others there are infinitely many limiting distributions. We conclude with examples. In one of our examples, we determine for which radii $r$ there exist sequences of conjugate sets of algebraic integers which uniformly distribute to the disk $D(0,r) \\subset \\mathbb{C}$, and we compute the limiting height for such sequences.",

Building on the multicategory HilbMult and the previously introduced Synergy Operad, we investigate the intrinsic algebraic structure underlying compositional quantum dynamics. Three main themes are developed. First, we introduce n-adjoints, a hierarchy of generalized adjoint operations that extend classical adjoints to multicategorical settings and capture higher-order operator interactions. We prove a multicategorical version of Stinespring's theorem formulated in terms of n-adjoints. Second, we study the algebraic semantics of quantum processes and show that completely positive trace-preserving maps admit a canonical monadic description. In particular, we prove a monadicity theorem identifying quantum processes, up to operadic operational equivalence, with algebras of a synergy monad induced by a symmetric quantum interaction operad, yielding a faithful representation that uniformly accounts for sequential and parallel composition. Third, we present an algebraic formulation of quantum no-go principles by encoding constraints such as the no-cloning theorem as operadic ideals. Together, these results provide a coherent algebraic framework that unifies operator theory, category theory, and quantum information.",

This work is based on the careful implementation of the pioneering Fokas unified transform methodology alongside its recently-proposed extension for solving a class of linear evolution equations with dispersion relation of specific polynomial type and time-dependent coefficients. We herein effectively extend those techniques to a special collection of evolution equations with time-dependent coefficients and mixed spatiotemporal derivatives, which induce rational dispersion relations. The new approach is exhibited in detail through illustrative generation of closed-form solutions for a multitude of such equations (such as Milne-Taylor-Barenblatt-Coleman-Ting-Chen-type, Benjamin-Bona-Mahony-type, as well as numerous higher-order variants) posed on the half-line. Challenging technical difficulties of complex-analytic and of algebraic flavour naturally emerge due the presence of mixed-derivative terms, and these are appropriately resolved in each case. The new formulas are of utility in subsequent investigation of qualitative properties and analysis of nonlinear counterparts too. Further extensions, generalizations, rigorous aspects and implementations to other types of problems as well will soon be reported in forthcoming publications.",

We show the global existence of weak solutions for such an initial-boundary value problem provided the initial energy is suitably small.

By introducing the Hamiltonian system and extending the gradient descent method to a Hilbert space, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal control under the uniform convexity condition. The regularity of the solution to the Hamiltonian system is obtained, including the derivatives with respect to the initial state and the Malliavin derivatives. The connection between the Hamiltonian system and the value function is subsequently proven, enabling us to derive regularity properties of the value function via probabilistic techniques. Finally, by the dynamic programming principle, the value function is verified to be the unique classical solution to the HJB equation and the optimal feedback control is provided. These results generalize the classical linear-quadratic theory and provide a new insight into the regularity of the value function.",

This is achieved by showing that branches of such domains bifurcate from the ``trivial'' domains $\u03a9_{t_j}$ at the values $t_{j} = \\frac\u03c0{2\\sqrt{\u03c3_j}}$ where $\u03c3_j$ ($j\\geq 1$) is a simple Neumann eigenvalue of the Laplace operator on $\u03c9\\subset \\mathbb{R}^{N-1}$. The solutions can be reflected with respect to $\u03c9$ to generate nontrivial solutions in a cylinder.",

Under a simple discrete orthogonality condition, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an inverse kernel lambda_3 (triangular of the same order) giving the inversion formula x^n = sum_{b=0}^{floor(n/m)} lambda_3(n,b) f_{n-mb}(x). This reindexing principle yields explicit change-of-basis relations between two families, including the case of distinct step sizes m_1 and m_2, with connection coefficients obtained from a universal triangular sum once lambda_3 is known. On the algebraic side, lambda_1 defines a lower Hessenberg matrix M_(n,k) (the algebraic expansion matrix) whose determinant governs inversion, providing closed determinantal expressions for lambda_3(n,k). We introduce a class of lambda-recursive sequences of order m, specified by a principal factor (p_n) and auxiliary factors (h_(n,k)), for which det(M_(n,k)) satisfies a recurrence enabling direct computation of inverse-kernel and basis-change coefficients. Classical families (e.g., Chebyshev, Legendre, Hermite, Laguerre, Fibonacci, Lucas) fit naturally into this framework, unifying their connection coefficients via the same triangular-array computations and supporting structured Clenshaw-type schemes and related applications.",

However, the analysis of analogous events on the full lattice is complicated by the long-range nature of entanglement percolation. We show that the probability that a rectangular loop is contractible exhibits a phase transition from area law to perimeter law dual to the entanglement percolation threshold, conditional on a conjecture concerning the continuity of entanglement percolation thresholds with respect to truncation.

We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.",

    "abstract": "A class of numerical quadrature rules is derived, with equally-spaced nodes, and unit weights except at a few points at each end of the series, for which \"corrections\" (not using any further information about the integrand) are added to the unit weights. If the correction sequences overlap, the effects are additive. A fundamental parameter (\"alpha\") in the derivation is the distance from the endpoint of the range of integration to the first node, measured inward in step-lengths. Setting alpha to 1/2 yields a set of corrected composite midpoint rules. Setting alpha=0 yields Gregory's closed Newton-Cotes-like rules, including (for sufficient overlap) the standard closed Newton-Cotes rules (trapezoidal rule, \"1/3 Simpson rule\", \"3/8 Simpson rule\", \"Boole's rule\", etc.). Setting alpha=1 yields open N-C-like rules, again including the standard ones. A negative alpha means that the integrand is sampled outside the range of integration; suitably chosen negative values yield centered finite-difference end-corrections for the trapezoidal rule and the midpoint rule. One can even have different values of alpha at the two ends, yielding, inter alia, Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton weights. Thus the title could have been \"Unified derivation of equispaced quadrature rules\".",

Using skeletal or seed equation, the polynomial can be transformed into a quadratic equation. A seed equation denotes a simple equation that represents a given integer as sum of three cubes including 0, for example, a seed equation for integer 2 is 1 cubed plus 1 cubed plus 0 cubed. Resultant quadratic equation can further be transformed into a linear equation which yields value of the variable and substitution of the value of the variable into the algebraic form of numbers results in the required solution. Notwithstanding, finding a single set of three cubes, we have found, using this approach, multiple sets of cubes. We have also given parametrisation for such cubes. Cases, where it is difficult or not possible to determine a seed equation, alternate method has been provided. Methods used are unattempted, innovative and easily comprehensible.",

By gradually changing the actual power grid system, smart grid may evolve into different systems by means of size, elements and strategies, but its fundamental requirements and objectives will not change such as optimizing production, transmission, and consumption. Studying the smart grid through modeling and simulation provides us with valuable results which cannot be obtained in real world due to time and cost related constraints. Moreover, due to the complexity of the smart grid, achieving global optimization is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a complex system based approach to the smart grid modeling, accentuating on the optimization by combining game theoretical and classical methods in different levels. Thanks to this combination, the optimization can be achieved with flexibility and scalability, while keeping its generality.",

    "abstract": "Based on a novel discretization procedure which has recently been proposed and applied in the construction of a canonical discrete analogue of confocal coordinate systems, an explicit method of constructing discrete analogues of ellipsoids is recorded. These discrete ellipsoids are entirely composed of planar quadrilaterals and come in pairs of combinatorially dual polyhedra, which together form princpal binets, a discrete counterpart of curvature line parametrizations. They exhibit a variety of algebraic and geometric properties which are classical in the case of their continuous counterparts. In a special case, it is demonstrated that the diagonals of the quadrilaterals of these discrete ellipsoids form two families of closed planar polygons. These polygons may be regarded as the discrete analogues of the classical circular cross sections of an ellipsoid. As in the continuous case, the discrete circles of any family lie in parallel planes and degenerate at the ``boundary'' of the discrete ellipsoids to ``umbilic vertices'' or ``umbilic edges''. Moreover, in analogy with the continuous theory, discrete ellipsoids admit a one-parameter family of deformations that preserve these discrete circles.",

We investigate the perfect reconstruction property of these filter banks and analyze their robustness against erasures for discrete-time signals in a finite-dimensional space $\\mathbb C^N$ . The study is further extended to non-uniform Ramanujan filter banks, showcasing their ability to address the limitations of uniform ones. Employing the reconstruction properties of uniform Ramanujan filter banks, we present an uncertainty principle associated with a tight frame of shifts of Ramanujan sums. This principle establishes representation inequalities in terms of Euler's totient function that provide sufficient conditions for the perfect recovery of signals in scenarios where signal information is lost during transmission or corrupted by noise. Finally, we illustrate that utilizing the signal's periodicity information through Ramanujan filter banks significantly improves the efficiency of signal recovery optimization algorithms, resulting in enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains and more precise reconstruction.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, randomized algorithms have established themselves as fundamental tools in computational linear algebra, with applications in scientific computing, machine learning, and quantum information science. Many randomized matrix algorithms proceed by first collecting information about a matrix and then processing that data to perform some computational task. This thesis addresses the following question: How can one design algorithms that use this information as efficiently as possible, reliably achieving the greatest possible speed and accuracy for a limited data budget?\n  The first part of this thesis focuses on low-rank approximation for positive-semidefinite matrices. Here, the goal is to compute an accurate approximation to a matrix after accessing as few entries of the matrix as possible. This part of the thesis explores the randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) algorithm for this task, which achieves a level of speed and reliability greater than other methods for the same problem.\n  The second part of this thesis considers the task of estimating attributes of an implicit matrix accessible only by matrix-vector products. This thesis describes the leave-one-out approach to developing matrix attribute estimation algorithms and develops optimized trace, diagonal, and row-norm estimation algorithms.\n  The third part of this thesis considers randomized algorithms for overdetermined linear least squares problems. Randomized algorithms for linear-least squares problems are asymptotically faster than any known deterministic algorithm, but recent work has raised questions about the accuracy of these methods in floating point arithmetic. This thesis shows these issues are resolvable by developing fast randomized least-squares problem achieving backward stability, the gold-standard stability guarantee for a numerical algorithm.",

That fact, opened a series of questions related with the number of isomorphism classes and its relation with the ground field.

The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.",

By virtue of improved Fourier splitting method, we then prove the optimal time decay rates under the critical regularity for $a=0$. When $a\\in (0,1]$, we establish time decay rates that are uniform with respect to $a$. Combining the time decay rate for $a\\in [0,1]$ and the time integrability, we obtain the uniform damping vanishing rates for the 2D Oldroyd-B model.

We prove that for almost all graphs $F$ on a given number of vertices, $i_{K_k}(F)$ attains infinitely many values as $k$ varies. For complete partite graphs $F$ (and, more generally, for symmetrizable families of graphs $F$), we prove that $i_H(F)=i_{K_k}(F)$ where $k=\u03c7(H)$, and is attained by a complete $\\ell$-partite graphon $W_{F,k}$, where $\\ell < k$.\n  We determine the part sizes of $W_{F,k}$ for all $k$, whence determine $i(F)$, whenever $F$ is the Tur\u00e1n graph on $s$ vertices and $r$ parts, for all $s \\le 3r+1$, which was recently proved by Liu, Mubayi, and Reiher for $s=r+1$. As a corollary, this determines the inducibility of all Tur\u00e1n graphs on at most $14$ vertices. Furthermore, since inducibility is invariant under complement, this determines the inducibility of all matchings and, more generally, all graphs with maximum degree $1$, of any size. Similarly, this determines the inducibility of all triangle factors, of any size.\n  For complete partite graphs $F$ with at most one singleton part, we prove that $i_{K_k}(F)$ only attains finitely many values as $k$ varies; in particular, there exists $t=t(F)$ such that $i(F)$ is attained by some complete $t$-partite graphon. This is best possible as it was shown by Liu, Pikhurko, Sharifzadeh, and Staden that this is not necessarily true if there are two singleton parts.\n  Finally, for every $r$, we give a nontrivial sufficient condition for a complete $r$-partite graph $F$ to have the property that $i(F)$ is attained by a complete partite graphon all whose part sizes are distinct.",

At each time step, each agent only observes its own instantaneous objective function and local inequality constraints; agents make decisions online and cooperate to minimize the sum of the time-varying objectives while satisfying the global coupled constraints. To solve the problem, we propose an algorithm based on the primal-dual approach combined with constraint-tracking. Under appropriate assumptions that the objective and constraint functions are convex, their gradients are uniformly bounded, and the path length of the optimal solution sequence grows sublinearly, we analyze theoretical properties of the proposed algorithm and prove that both the dynamic regret and the constraint violation are sublinear with time horizon T. Finally, we evaluate the proposed algorithm on a time-varying economic dispatch problem in power systems using both synthetic data and Australian Energy Market data. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs effectively in terms of tracking performance, constraint satisfaction, and adaptation to time-varying disturbances, thereby providing a practical and theoretically well-supported solution for real-time distributed economic dispatch.",

However, the combinatorial factor $\\frac{1}{\\operatorname{atyp}(\u03bb)!}$ makes a direct BGG-type categorification of this formula rather elusive.\n  In this paper we construct, for a certain class of ``generic'' weights, a resolution that categorifies a known Weyl-type finite-sum character formula of the same flavour as the Kac--Wakimoto formula. Our resolution is built from taking images of canonical homomorphisms between Verma modules corresponding to non-conjugate Borel subalgebras via odd reflections.\n  Note that, while the infinite resolution of Kac--Wakimoto simple modules by Kac modules constructed by Brundan--Stroppel~\\cite{brundan2010highestII} does not directly generalize the classical BGG resolution, the construction developed here does.",

    "abstract": "Two fundamental ways to represent a group are as permutations and as matrices. In this paper, we study linear representations of groups that intertwine with a permutation representation. Recently, D'Alconzo and Di Scala investigated how small the matrices in such a linear representation can be. The minimal dimension of such a representation is the \\emph{linear dimension of the group action} and this has applications in cryptography and cryptosystems.\n  We develop the idea of linear dimension from an algebraic point of view by using the theory of permutation modules. We give structural results about representations of minimal dimension and investigate the implications of faithfulness, transitivity and primitivity on the linear dimension. Furthermore, we compute the linear dimension of several classes of finite primitive permutation groups. We also study wreath products, allowing us to determine the linear dimension of imprimitive group actions. Finally, we give the linear dimension of almost simple finite $2$-transitive groups, some of which may be used for further applications in cryptography. Our results also open up many new questions about linear representations of group actions.",

For the exact/Waldhausen categories of finitely generated bi-positional $n$-ary $\\Ga$-modules, perfect complexes in the derived category, and perfect quasi-coherent complexes on the non-commutative $\\Ga$-spectrum $\\SpecGnC{T}$, we prove Waldhausen Fibration and Additivity theorems and Quillen-type Localization for Serre and Waldhausen pairs.

We further derive a Bass--Quillen fundamental triangle for polynomial extensions in the $n$-ary $\\Ga$-context and prove nilpotent invariance for two-sided $\\Ga$-ideals. In geometric terms, these results yield localization and Mayer--Vietoris sequences for the $K$-theory of $\\Perf(X)$ on $X=\\SpecGnC{T}$ and its admissible open covers.

However, replacing the underlying random distribution (e.g., demand distribution) with its mean (e.g., the time-varying average arrival rate) introduces bias in performance estimation and can lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we investigate how to identify an alternative point statistic, which is not necessarily the mean, such that substituting this statistic into the two-stage optimization problem yields the optimal decision. We refer to this statistic as the decision-corrected point estimate (time-varying arrival rate). For a general service network with customer abandonment costs, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such a corrected point estimate and propose an algorithm for its computation. Under a decomposable network structure, we further show that the resulting decision-corrected point estimate is closely related to the classical newsvendor solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of our decision-focused correction method compared to the traditional fluid approximation.",

    "abstract": "Molecular Communication (MC) is an emerging field of research focused on understanding how cells in the human body communicate and exploring potential medical applications. In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications.",

We introduce a unified framework for formalizing classes of rules according to the information about the input that they rely on. Within this framework, we show lower bounds for \\emph{ranking-based} classes of rules that base their decisions on orderings of the improving pivot steps induced by the underlying data. Our first result is a superpolynomial lower bound for strategy improvement, obtained via a family of sink parity games, which applies to memory-based generalizations of Bland's rule that only access the input by comparing the ranks of improving edges in some global order. Our second result is a subexponential lower bound for policy iteration, obtained via a family of Markov decision processes, which applies to memoryless rules that only access the input by comparing improving actions according to their ranks in a global order, their reduced costs, and the associated improvements in objective value.

    "abstract": "A non-uniform channel input distribution is key for achieving the capacity of arbitrary channels. However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm. One such algorithm is enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution. In these simulations, we found that generalized ESS improves the maximum transmission rate by 0.0425 bit/symbol at a frame error rate below 10^{-4} compared to CCDM.",

    "abstract": "We study the computation of lower and upper probabilities of hitting a target set of states for imprecise Markov chains. For these, transition uncertainty is modelled by a convex set of transition matrices. In the precise case, hitting probabilities are the minimal nonnegative solution of a linear system and admit a closed-form expression. We study the notion of reachability in the imprecise setting. The literature review highlights few different definitions of lower reachability; thus we explore the relations among them, presenting examples to clarify their logical implications. Using this revised definition of reachability for imprecise Markov chain, we partition the state space into classes of states whose hitting probabilities are trivially zero or one and those which require further computation. For these nontrivial states, we show that lower and upper hitting probabilities are the unique solutions of two nonlinear fixed-point equations. For the practical computation of lower and upper hitting probabilities, we propose iterative algorithms that alternate between solving a linear system and choosing an extreme point from the set of transition matrices. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in practice, these algorithms converge in substantially fewer iterations than the theoretically established worst-case bound.",

We consider the twisted Selberg zeta function $Z(s;\u03c1)$ associated to a representation $\u03c1: \u03c0_1(X_1) \\to \\text{GL}(V_\u03c1)$. We prove a relation between the twisted Selberg zeta function $Z(s;\u03c1)$ and the regularized determinant of the twisted Laplacian associated to $\u03c1$. These results can be viewed as a generalization of a result due to Sarnak who considered the trivial character. Yet our proof is different, as it is based on evaluation of the Laplace-Mellin type integral transformations. Going further, we explicitly compute the multiplicative constant, which we call the torsion factor, and express its dependence on parameters which determine the representation. We study the asymptotic behavior of the constant for a sequence of non-unitary representations introduced by Yamaguchi and prove that the asymptotic behavior of this constant as the dimension of the representation tends to infinity is the same as the behavior of the higher-dimensional Reidemeister torsion on $X_1$ (up to an absolute constant).",

In this work, we show that such optimizers can be provably improved by replacing their vanilla momentum by momentum variance reduction (MVR). Instead of proposing and analyzing MVR variants of Muon and Scion separately, we incorporate MVR into the recently proposed Gluon framework, which captures Muon, Scion and other specific Non-Euclidean LMO-based methods as special cases, and at the same time works with a more general smoothness assumption which better captures the layer-wise structure of neural networks. In the non-convex case, we incorporate MVR into Gluon in three different ways. All of them improve the convergence rate from ${\\cal O} (\\frac{1}{K^{1/4}})$ to ${\\cal O} (\\frac{1}{K^{1/3}})$. Additionally, we provide improved rates in the star-convex case.

    "abstract": "In convex optimization, continuous-time counterparts have been a fruitful tool for analyzing momentum algorithms. Fewer such examples are available when the function to minimize is non-convex. In several cases, discrepancies arise between the existing discrete-time results, namely those obtained for momentum algorithms, and their continuous-time counterparts, with the latter typically yielding stronger guarantees. We argue that the continuized framework (Even et al., 2021), mixing continuous and discrete components, can tighten the gap between known continuous and discrete results. This framework relies on computations akin to standard Lyapunov analyses, from which are deduced convergence bounds for an algorithm that can be written as a Nesterov momentum algorithm with stochastic parameters. In this work, we extend the range of applicability of the continuized framework, e.g. by allowing it to handle non-smooth Lyapunov functions. We then strengthen its trajectory-wise guarantees for linear convergence rate, deriving finite time bounds with high probability and asymptotic almost sure bounds. We apply this framework to the non-convex class of strongly quasar convex functions. Adapting continuous-time results that have weaker discrete equivalents to the continuized method, we improve by a constant factor the known convergence rate, and relax the existing assumptions on the set of minimizers.",

We introduce a component-based taxonomy that decomposes OP variants into time-, path-, node-, structure-, and information-based extensions. This framework unifies classical and emerging variants -- including stochastic, time-dependent, Dubins, Set, and multi-period OPs -- within a single structural perspective. We further categorize solution approaches into exact algorithms, heuristics and metaheuristics, and learning-based methods, with particular emphasis on matheuristics and recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially reinforcement learning and neural networks, which enhance scalability in large-scale and information-rich settings. Building on this unified view, we discuss how different components affect computational complexity and polyhedral properties and identify open challenges related to robustness, sustainability, and AI integration. The survey thus provides both a consolidated reference for existing OP research and a structured agenda for future theoretical and applied work.",

In this case $(S,T,U)$ is called a TPP triple of $G$ and $|S||T||U|$ is called the size of the triple. The triple product ratio of $G$ can be defined as the quantity $\u03c1(G) := \\frac{\u03b2(G)}{|G|}$, where $\u03b2(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$, and a special case of this, the subgroup triple product ratio, is the quantity $\u03c1_0(G) := \\frac{\u03b2_0(G)}{|G|}$, where $\u03b2_0(G)$ is the largest size of a TPP triple of $G$ composed only of subgroups. There is a conjecture that $\u03c1(G) \\leq \\frac{4}{3}$ if $G$ contains a cyclic subgroup of index $2$.

Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \\(f\\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \\(f\\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a \u0141ojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer.

When employing binary Golay sequences with guaranteed low PAPR in the design, the fundamental problem is to construct a large set of $n$-variable quadratic bent or near-bent functions in a particular form such that the difference of any two is bent for even $n$ or near-bent for odd $n$ to achieve optimally low coherence.

The radial harmonic oscillator problem with position-dependent mass is shown to exhibit a deformed shape invariance property in a deformed supersymmetric framework. The inverse point canonical transformation then provides some exactly-solvable rational extensions of the radial harmonic oscillator with position-dependent mass associated with $X_m$-Jacobi exceptional orthogonal polynomials of type I, II, or III. The extended potentials of type I and II are proved to display deformed shape invariance. The spectrum and wavefunctions of the radial harmonic oscillator potential and its extensions are shown to go over to well-known results when the deforming parameter $\u03b1$ goes to zero.",

Then we introduce a new family of graphs called the extended Hamming graph, denoted by $EH(n,2^n)$, which is constructed from the well-known Hamming graph $H(n,2^n)$. The graph $EH(n,2^n)$ shares the same vertex set as $H(n,2^n)$ but includes additional edges, called complementary edges, connecting each $n$-tuple vertex $u$ to its complement $u^c$, where $u^c$ is defined such that the sum of each two corresponding coordinates of $u$ and $u^c$ equals $2^n-1$. We investigate several algebraic and structural properties of this new family of graphs. Specifically, we show that the diameter of $EH(n,2^n)$ is $n$. We prove that $EH(n,2^n)$ is a Cayley graph, but we demonstrate that it is not a distance regular graph. Finally, we determine the spectrum of $EH(n,2^n)$, showing that its eigenvalues are $\u03bb_i\\pm 1$, where $\u03bb_i$ are the eigenvalues of the underlying Hamming graph $H(n,2^n)$.

We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {\u00e0} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the K\u00e4hler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\\subset\\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\\mathbb{H}\\subset\\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincar\u00e9 and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\\mathrm{H}\\subset \\mathrm{U}$.",

The latter immediately implies the unconditional stability of the scheme. Based on the comparison principle we prove the convergence of the scheme to the viscosity solution of obstacle mean curvature flow. Moreover, using the minimizing movements interpretation, we show convergence of a spatially discrete model. Finally, we present numerical experiments for a physical model that inspired this work.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates two distinct types of block errors - undetected errors (confusions) and erasures - in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with error-bounded block decoders operating in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR.",

    "abstract": "Partial Information Decomposition (PID) seeks to disentangle how information about a target variable is distributed across multiple sources, separating redundant, unique, and synergistic contributions. Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist.",

These bounds extend previous work on error bounds in the total variation distance, and are the first step towards a generalization to continuous-time Markov processes with continuous state spaces. A Wasserstein matrix norm is used to bound the error caused by the lower-dimensional approximation of the dynamics. In order to control the propagation of the accumulated error, we rely on the concept of coarse Ricci curvature of a Markov chain. The practical applicability of the presented bounds depends strongly on the curvature of the chain. Examples for CTMCs taken from the literature (where we added a metric on the state space) show that a negative curvature results in exponentially exploding bounds. On the other hand, certain CTMCs which we call translation-invariant always have non-negative curvature. When measuring the error in the total variation distance (a special case of the Wasserstein distance with the discrete metric), the curvature is also always non-negative. If it is strictly positive, the bounds presented in this paper are an improvement over previous work.",

(2016, 2017) introduced the idea of Granger causality (GC) maps for Langevin systems: dynamics are localised linearly at each point in phase space as vector Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (VOU) processes, for which GCs may in principle be calculated, thus constructing a GC map on phase space. Their implementation, however, suffered a significant drawback: GCs were approximated from models based on discrete-time stroboscopic sampling of local VOU processes, which is not only computationally inefficient, but more seriously, unfeasible on regions of phase space where local dynamics are unstable, leaving \"holes\" in the GC maps. We solve these problems by deriving an analytical expression for GC rates associated with a VOU process which, under quite general conditions, yields a meaningful solution even in the unstable case. Applied to GC maps, this not only \"fills in the holes\", but also furnishes a computationally efficient method of calculation devolving to solution of continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations which, in the case of a univariate source, become simple quadratic equations. We show, furthermore, that the GC rate for VOU processes is invariant under rescaling of the overall fluctuations intensity, so that GC maps may effectively be calculated for deterministic nonlinear dynamical systems, with a residual \"ghost of noise\" represented by a variance-covariance map.",

Self-similar Markov trees (ssMt) are random decorated trees that encode the genealogy of a system of particles carrying positive labels, and where particles undergo splitting and growth depending on their labels in a self-similar fashion. Introduced and developed in the recent monograph (Bertoin-Curien-Riera, 2024), they provide a broad generalization of Brownian and stable continuum random trees and arise naturally in various models of random geometry such as the Brownian sphere/disk. The law of a ssMt is characterized by its quadruplet $(\\mathrm{a}, \u03c3^2, \\boldsymbol\u039b; \u03b1)$, which specifies the features of the underlying growth-fragmentation mechanism, together with the initial decoration $x>0$. In this work, we focus on special cases of ssMt in which the trees started from different initial values $x>0$ can be coupled into a continuous, increasing family of nested subtrees. In the case of the Brownian and stable continuum random trees, this yields surprisingly simple novel dynamics corresponding to the scaling limit of the leaf-growth algorithms of Luczak-Winkler and Caraceni-Stauffer.",

    "title": "Landscape Analysis of Excited States Calculation over Quantum Computers",
    "abstract": "The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is one of the most promising algorithms for low-lying eigenstates calculation on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Specifically, VQE has achieved great success for ground state calculations of a Hamiltonian. However, excited state calculations arising in quantum chemistry and condensed matter often requires solving more challenging problems than the ground state as these states are generally further away from a mean-field description, and involve less straightforward optimization to avoid the variational collapse to the ground state. Maintaining orthogonality between low-lying eigenstates is a key algorithmic hurdle. In this work, we analyze three VQE models that embed orthogonality constraints through specially designed cost functions, avoiding the need for external enforcement of orthogonality between states. Notably, these formulations possess the desirable property that any local minimum is also a global minimum, helping address optimization difficulties. We conduct rigorous landscape analyses of the models' stationary points and local minimizers, theoretically guaranteeing their favorable properties and providing analytical tools applicable to broader VQE methods. A comprehensive comparison between the three models is also provided, considering their quantum resource requirements and classical optimization complexity.",

The method can handle continuous and discontinuous bathymmetry as well as general triangular meshes. It is complemented by a finite volume method on Delauney triangulations which is also shown to be non-negativity preserving. Both methods feature an upwind flux and can handle Manning's and Chezy's friction law. By numerical experiment we demonstrate the discontinuous Galerkin method to be fully second-order accurate for the Barenblatt analytical solution on an inclined plane. In constrast, the finite volume method is only first-order accurate. Further numerical experiments show that three to four mesh refinements are needed for the finite volume method to match the solution of the discontinuous Galerkin method.",

    "abstract": "We study finite-time blowup for a nonlinear wave equation for maps from the Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{1+d}$ into the 1-sphere $\\mathbb{S}^1$, whose nonlinearity exhibits a null-form structure. We construct, for every dimension $d \\geq 1$, a countable family of discretely self-similar blowup solutions, which are even for $d=1$ and radial for $d \\geq 2$. The main contribution of the paper is a detailed nonlinear stability analysis of this family of solutions. For $d \\geq 2$, we consider radial data, while in $d=1$ we allow for general perturbations. After linearizing around the self-similar profiles in similarity variables, we construct resolvents of the resulting highly non-self-adjoint operators through Liouville-Green transformations and precise Volterra-type asymptotics. The construction itself, which occupies most of the paper, is technically challenging, as it is performed in arbitrary dimensions and for a countable family of operators in each. Combined with a detailed spectral analysis of the linearized operators, this yields sharp semigroup bounds and allows us to establish nonlinear stability of all discretely self-similar profiles in all dimensions, with precise co-dimension determined by the unstable spectrum. To our knowledge, this is the first result on the existence and stability of discretely self-similar blowup for a geometric wave equation.",

    "title": "The Bi-objective Electric Autonomous Dial-a-Ride Problem",
    "abstract": "The electric autonomous dial-a-ride problem (E-ADARP) introduces electric, autonomously driving vehicles and their unique requirements into the classic dial-a-ride problem, where people are transported between pickup and drop-off locations. Next to an electric autonomous vehicle fleet, in the literature, a weighted-sum objective function, which combines the classic routing cost-oriented objective with a user-oriented objective function, has usually been considered. The user-oriented objective function minimizes the total excess user ride time. In this work, we treat them as two separate objective functions, which are optimized concurrently. In order to address the resulting bi-objective E-ADARP, we develop a novel exact framework (called fragment-based checker), whose core part is a smart ``select-and-check\" algorithm that iteratively constructs feasible solutions using fragments. Several enhancements are proposed to enforce the computational efficiency of the proposed method. In the computational experiments, we evaluate several variants of our checker algorithm by leveraging a previously developed branch-and-price algorithm. We benchmark the checker-based framework against state-of-the-art criterion space frameworks as well as a generalized branch-and-price algorithm. Numerical results on both bi-objective DARP and E-ADARP instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. With our proposed approaches, 21 out of 38 instances are solved optimally, where small-to-medium-sized instances are solved within seconds. On larger-scale instances, especially those requiring high battery end levels are computationally challenging to solve, our approaches provide high-quality approximations of the Pareto frontiers. Efficient solutions with varying energy restrictions are compared and we obtain valuable managerial insights for different kinds of service providers.",

    "abstract": "Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technology has emerged as a promising technology to enable massive connectivity and enhanced spectral efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks.",
