    "abstract": "Let $(X,T)$ be a Cantor minimal system, and let $\u0393$ denote either its associated topological full group or the full group of a Bratteli diagram associated with $(X,T)$. In this paper we describe the structure of indecomposable (extreme) characters and the associated $\\textrm{II}_1$-factor representations for the group $\u0393$ and its commutator subgroup $\u0393'$. In particular, we prove that: (1) for every nontrivial indecomposable character $\u03c7$ of $\u0393'$, there exists a finite collection (with repetitions allowed) $\\{\u03bc_i\\}_{i\\in I}$ of $T$-invariant ergodic measures on $X$ such that $\u03c7(\u03b3) = \\prod_{i\\in I} \u03bc_i(Fix(\u03b3))$, for every $\u03b3\\in \u0393'$, where $Fix(\u03b3) = \\{x\\in X : \u03b3x = x\\}$; and (2) each indecomposable character of $\u0393$ is the product of an indecomposable character of the form $\\prod_{i\\in I} \u03bc_i(Fix(\u03b3))$ and a homomorphism from $\u0393$ into the unit circle.\n  As a consequence, we show that any finite-type unitary representation of $\u0393'$ that does not contain a regular subrepresentation is automatically continuous with respect to the uniform topology on $\u0393'$.\n  We also establish a general result on automatic continuity of finite-type unitary representations of infinite groups, which we use in our proofs.",

We prove that for any group $G$ that admits a finite $(n+1)$-dimensional model for $K(G,1)$, the homological $n$-isoperimetric function of $G$ over $R$ is either linear or takes infinite values. In particular, by results of Gersten and Mineyev, in the class of groups admitting a finite $2$-dimensional classifying space, the homological $1$-dimensional isoperimetric function over $R$ only captures hyperbolicity. This follows as a particular case of a more general result proved in this note.",

    "abstract": "Plates generally admit six deformation modes: three of which are high in strain energy, stretch the plate's midsurface and are called membrane modes; and three are low-energy, bend the midsurface without stretching it and are called bending modes. For origami tessellations, and other corrugated compliant thin shells, the modes are mixed and it is no longer clear what modes, if any, are low in energy in the sense that they are inextensional. Here, it is shown, by direct construction of closed-form solutions, that when the midsurface is a surface of translation, there exists three infinitesimally inextensional deformation modes that correspond to (1) stretching, with an effective Poisson's effect; (2) bending, with an effective synclastic or anti-clastic effect; and to (3) twisting. The provided expressions are valid irrespective of surface regularity and, in particular, properly handle any creases be them straight or curved. The results provide a powerful benchmark for the validation of numerical methods and further insight into the elastic stiffness of thin corrugated compliant shells.",

By introducing concepts such as \"outer boundary\", \"primitive set\", \"Properties A/B/C\", and the operation of \"adding an n-point region on an interval\", we construct a step-by-step framework for coloring any given planar graph. The core of this framework consists of four theorems, which ensure that after sequentially adding specific regions to an outer boundary satisfying Properties A, B, and C, the new outer boundary continues to satisfy these properties, ultimately allowing the entire graph to be colored using only four colors. This method avoids computer enumeration and offers a more constructive perspective on the proof.",

Despite being incredibly successful since the 1960s, our understanding of the technique remained fairly limited compared to the theory of forcing. Whereas forcing developed products and iterations, no serious attempts at developing any general framework for iterating symmetric extensions were presented before [10], where only finite support iterations are treated. In this paper we develop the theory of symmetric extensions including different types of iterations, quotients, equivalents, and the structural results that can be described in this language. In particular, we give a modern exposition to some of the important theorems of Grigorieff [3], study Kinna--Wagner Principles in symmetric extensions, and show that it is provable from $\\mathsf{ZF}$ that every set lies in a symmetric extension of $\\operatorname{HOD}$.",

When rescaling the thin domain, isotropic interaction ranges naturally become anisotropic, leading to the development of a theory for anisotropic nonlocal gradients with direction-dependent interaction ranges. Unlike existing nonlocal derivatives with finite horizon, which are defined via interaction kernels supported on balls of positive radius, our formulation is based on ellipsoidal interaction regions whose principal radii may vanish independently. This yields a unified framework that interpolates between fully nonlocal, partially nonlocal, and purely local models. Employing these tools, we present a $\u0393$-convergence analysis for the nonlocal thin-film energies. The limit functional retains the structural form of the classical membrane energy, and the classical local model is recovered precisely when all interaction radii vanish.",

Our method implements a protocol that shares a semantic pre-equalizer at the AP and local semantic equalizers at user devices, fostering mutual understanding and task-oriented communication while considering power and complexity constraints. To achieve this, we employ a federated optimization for the decentralized training of the semantic equalizers at the AP and user sides.

    "abstract": "Dynamic facility location problems predominantly suppose a monopoly over the service or product provided. Nonetheless, this premise can be a severe oversimplification in the presence of market competitors, as customers may prefer facilities installed by one of them. The monopolistic assumption can particularly worsen planning performance when demand depends on prior location decisions of the market participants, namely, when unmet demand from one period carries over to the next. Such a demand behaviour creates an intrinsic relationship between customer demand and location decisions of all market participants, and requires the decision-maker to anticipate the competitor's response. This work studies a novel competitive facility location problem that combines cumulative demand and market competition to devise high-quality solutions. We propose bilevel mixed-integer programming formulations for two variants of our problem, prove that the optimistic variant is $\u03a3^{p}_{2}$-hard, and develop branch-and-cut algorithms with tightened value-function cuts that significantly outperform general-purpose bilevel solvers. Our results quantify the severe cost of planning under a monopolistic assumption (profit drops by half on average) and the gains from cooperation over competition (6% more joint profit), while drawing managerial guidelines on how instance attributes and duopolistic modelling choices shape robust location schedules.",

    "title": "Iterated mutations of symmetric periodic algebras",
    "abstract": "Following methods used by A. Dugas for investigating derived equivalent pairs of (weakly) symmetric algebras, we apply them in a specific situation, obtaining new deep results concerning iterated mutations of symmetric periodic algebras. More specifically, for any symmetric algebra $\u039b$, and an arbitrary vertex $i$ of its Gabriel quiver, one can define mutation $\u03bc_i(\u039b)$ of $\u039b$ at vertex $i$ via silting mutation of the stalk complex $\\La$. Then $\u03bc_i(\u039b)$ is again symmetric, and we can iterate this process. We want to understand the order of $\u03bc_i$, in case the vertex $i$ is $d$-periodic, i.e. the simple module $S_i$ associated to $i$ is periodic of period $d$ (with respect to the syzygy). The main result of this paper shows that then $\u03bc_i$ has order $d-2$, that is $\u03bc_i^{d-2}(\u039b)\\cong\u039b$ (modulo socle), under some additional assumption on the (periodic) projective-injective resolution of $S_i$. Besides, we present briefly some consequences concerning arbitrary periodic vertex and give few sugestive examples showing that this property should hold in general, i.e. without restrictions on the periodic projective resolution.",

In contrast, in the four-dimensional case, the analysis also relies critically on concepts from four-dimensional geometry.\n  A key observation is that submanifolds satisfying the pinching condition necessarily have nonnegative isotropic curvature, a notion introduced by Micallef and Moore.

When at least the linear part of the equations of motion is known, our GSS algorithm outperforms available data-driven neural-network-based techniques for predicting forced response in structural dynamics problems.

We then formulate the inverse design problem as an optimal control problem constrained by the fragmentation dynamics and prove the existence of the optimal control problem. Also derive the corresponding continuous adjoint equation and propose a gradient-type iterative reconstruction method. For the numerical implementation, we develop finite volume schemes for both the forward and adjoint equations, including a weighted finite volume scheme designed to enhance mass conservation and accuracy. Two benchmark problems, involving linear and nonlinear fragmentation rates with known analytical solutions, are used to assess the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach and to compare the performance of the two discretizations in both forward simulations and inverse reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "The goal of $L$-step speculative decoding is to accelerate autoregressive decoding of a target model by using a cheaper draft model to generate a candidate path of $L$ tokens. Based on a verification algorithm involving target and draft model probabilities, a prefix of the candidate sequence is accepted, and an additional correction token is sampled from a residual distribution to ensure that the final output adheres to the target distribution. While standard speculative decoding uses a verification algorithm which is independent at each token on the path, a recent extension called block verification uses a joint condition involving all sampled on-path probabilities. Block verification (BV) was shown to be optimal over all verification algorithms which use only on-path probabilities, improving on standard speculative decoding. In this work, we first show that block verification is optimal even over verification algorithms that use off-path probabilities, by constructing an information-agnostic linear program (LP). Further, we can extend our LP to the setting where the draft model samples multiple candidate paths, and use it to construct a natural class of multi-path block verification generalizations. While computing the optimal algorithm in this class is not tractable, by considering a stricter class of greedy algorithms, we can formulate an efficient method called greedy multi-path block verification (GBV). Empirically, GBV can improve block efficiency by over 30% and reduce decoding walltimes by over 15% relative to BV. On Llama-3 70B, GBV can improve the end-to-end decoding throughput over SOTA multi-path verification methods by more than 15%.",

Our approach is different from earlier treatments which were based on associated permanental processes rather than Gaussian processes.\n  The type of process with which we work can be described as follows. Start with a symmetric Markov process with finite lifetime; upon its death resurrect it at a place in the state space chosen at random, independent of the past. Continue in this way, resurrecting at each death, to obtain a recurrent process. The rebirthing procedure destroys the symmetry of the original process, leading to a large class of non-symmetric processes.\n  The main results are illustrated by many examples.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an interpretation of Grothendieck's geometric universes as a foundational framework for \\emph{information networks}. We argue that Grothendieck topologies, sheaves, and topoi provide a sheaf-theoretic semantics in which distributed and locally held information can be integrated into globally coherent structures. In this setting, local informational states are represented by sections, while the sheaf condition governs consistency, agreement, and consensus across a network. Logical validity and mathematical existence are therefore not imposed externally but arise intrinsically from geometric and categorical conditions. From this perspective, Grothendieck's geometric universes constitute a natural foundation for information networks governed by intrinsic logical principles. Moreover, we propose that Grothendieck's geometric universes themselves concretely instantiate what the author calls \\emph{intrinsic logicism}. This position is intended as a contemporary reconstruction of the classical logicist program of Frege and Russell, reformulated within the framework of category theory and topos theory, where logical structure is generated internally by geometric and categorical organization rather than presupposed as an external foundational layer.",

    "abstract": "A classical theorem in the theory of minimal surfaces establishes a correspondence between minimal surfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ and null holomorphic curves in $\\mathbb{C}^n$. A hyperbolic version of this correspondence is due to Bryant: null holomorphic curves in ${\\rm SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$ correspond to CMC-1 surfaces in the hyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^3$. We also have a relativistic Bryant type correspondence: CMC-1 immersions in the hyperbolic space are replaced by space-like CMC-1 immersion in the de Sitter space. We prove a mutual generalisation of all these results: let $H$ be a real Lie group, $\u03c0:P \\to M$ a principal $H$-bundle, $A$ a connection on $P$ and $\u03b1\\in A^1_{\\rm Ad}(P,\\mathfrak{h})$ a tensorial 1-form of type ${\\rm Ad}$ which induces isomorphisms $A_\u03be\\to \\mathfrak{h}$. Such a pair $(\u03b1,A)$ defines an almost complex structure $J^\u03b1_A$ on $P$, which is integrable if and only $(\u03b1,A)$ solves a gauge-invariant first order differential system. A non-degenerate symmetric ${\\rm Ad}_H$-invariant bilinear form $g$ on $\\mathfrak{h}$ defines pseudo-Riemannian metrics $g^\u03b1_M$, $\\mathfrak{g}^\u03b1_A$ on $M$, respectively $P$, and a non-degenerate bilinear form $\u03c9^{\u03b1,g}_A:T_P\\times_P T_P\\to \\mathbb{C}$ which is holomorphic when $J^\u03b1_A$ is integrable. Assuming that this is the case, we have a Bryant type correspondence between space-like, $\u03c9^{\u03b1,g}_A$-isotropic holomorphic immersions $Y\\to P$ and space-like conformal immersions $Y\\to (M,g^\u03b1_M)$ whose mean curvature vector field is given by a simple explicit formula. In particular, one obtains such a correspondence for any principal bundle of the form $G\\to G/H$, where $G$ is a complex Lie group, and $H$ is a real form of $G$ endowed with a non-degenerate, ${\\rm Ad}_H$-invariant, symmetric bilinear form $g$ on its Lie-algebra $\\mathfrak{h}$.",

    "abstract": "Piecewise deterministic Markov process samplers are attractive alternatives to Metropolis--Hastings algorithms. A central design question is how to incorporate partial velocity refreshment to ensure ergodicity without injecting excessive noise. Forward Event-Chain Monte Carlo (FECMC) is a generalization of the Bouncy Particle Sampler (BPS) that addresses this issue through a stochastic reflection mechanism, thereby reducing reliance on global refreshment moves. Despite promising empirical performance, its theoretical efficiency remains largely unexplored.\n  We develop a high-dimensional scaling analysis for standard Gaussian targets and prove that the negative log-density (or potential) process of FECMC converges to an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck diffusion, under the same scaling as BPS. We derive closed-form expressions for the limiting diffusion coefficients of both methods by analyzing their associated radial momentum processes and solving the corresponding Poisson equations. These expressions yield a sharp efficiency comparison: the diffusion coefficient of FECMC is strictly larger than that of optimally tuned BPS, and the optimum for FECMC is attained at zero global refreshment. Specifically, they imply an approximately eightfold increase in effective sample size per event over optimal BPS. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted diffusion coefficients and show that the resulting efficiency gains remain substantial for a range of non-Gaussian targets. Finally, as an application of these results, we propose an asymptotic variance estimator for Piecewise deterministic Markov processes that becomes increasingly efficient in high dimensions by extracting information from the velocity variable.",

Remarkably, complex eigenvalues with positive real parts, which ensure stability for first-order gradient dynamics, induce exponential instability in NAGD.

Our new approach uses hypocoercivity estimates, which may be of interest in their own right, and lead to a very direct derivation, providing in particular a clear explanation of the ``noise-induced drift'' term in the overdamped equation in the case of a state-dependent friction term. Using the same approach, we also treat several effective kinetic dynamical models derived from a coarse-graining approximation of a high-dimensional system, as well as a class of kinetic dynamics with position-dependent mass matrices. All of these models are relevant to applications in computational chemistry. We finally identify a mistake in a related work and suggest a solution.",

Such measurement setups, combining focused illumination with scanning, have not yet been incorporated into the diffraction tomography framework. To bridge this gap, we extend diffraction tomography by modeling incident fields as Herglotz waves, thereby incorporating focused beams into the theory.

In the classical setting, the object is illuminated by plane waves from many directions, and the Fourier diffraction theorem gives a direct relation between the Fourier transform of the scattering potential of the object and the Fourier transformed measurements.\n  In many practical imaging systems, however, focused beams are used instead of plane waves. These beams are then translated across the object to bring different regions of interest into focus. The Fourier diffraction relation adapted to this setting differs in one crucial point from the plane-wave case: while certain Fourier coefficients of the measurements still directly correspond to individual Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential, others are given by linear combinations of two Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential.\n  This article investigates which Fourier coefficients of the scattering potential can be uniquely recovered from these relations. We show that in dimensions higher than two, all coefficients appearing in the equations are typically uniquely determined. In two dimensions, however, only part of the Fourier coverage is uniquely recoverable, while on the remaining subset, distinct coefficients can produce identical data.",

    "abstract": "Random spatial networks-that is, graphs whose connectivity is governed by geometric proximity-have emerged as fundamental models for systems constrained by an underlying spatial structure. A prototypical example is the random geometric graph, obtained by placing vertices according to a Poisson point process and connecting two vertices whenever their Euclidean distance is less than a certain threshold. Despite their broad applicability, the spectral properties of such spatial models remain far less understood than those of classical random graph models, such as Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs and Wigner matrices. The main obstacle is the presence of spatial constraints, which induce highly nontrivial dependencies among edges, placing these models outside the scope of techniques developed for purely combinatorial random graphs.\n  In this paper, we provide the first rigorous analysis of Gaussian fluctuations for linear eigenvalue statistics of random geometric graphs. Specifically, we establish central limit theorems for $\\text{Tr}[\u03c6(A)]$, where $A$ is the adjacency matrix and $\u03c6$ ranges over a broad class of suitable (possibly non-polynomial) test functions. In the polynomial setting, we moreover obtain a quantitative central limit theorem, including an explicit convergence rate to the limiting Gaussian law. We further obtain polynomial-test-function CLTs for other canonical random spatial networks, including $k$-nearest neighbor graphs and relative neighborhood graphs. Our results open new avenues for the study of spectral fluctuations in spatially embedded random structures and underscore the delicate interplay between geometry, local dependence, and spectral behavior.",

The first one is to calculate the asymptotic expansion of the Hessian matrix of the action integral and concludes using arXiv:1505.01382 as in arXiv:1710.03936 . This shows instability when both limiting solitary waves are stable. The second approach studies the convergence of the spectrum when the period goes to infinity and is applied in remaining cases, when one of the solitary waves is unstable.

Therefore, this paper presents a resource management framework for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS)-assisted AR-enabled Metaverse, where the STAR-RIS is configured to improve the communication efficiency between AR users and the Metaverse server located at the base station (BS). Moreover, we formulate a service latency minimization problem via jointly optimizing the computation resource allocation of the BS, coefficient matrix of the STAR-RIS, central processing unit (CPU) frequency and transmit power of the AR users. To tackle the non-convex problem, we utilize an approximate method to transform it to a tractable form, and decouple the multi-dimensional variables via the alternating optimization method. Particularly, the optimal coefficient matrix is obtained by a penalty function-based method with proved convergence, the CPU frequencies of AR users are derived as the closed-form solution, and the transmit power of AR users and computation resource allocation of the BS are obtained by the Lagrange duality method and convex optimization theory. Finally, simulation results demonstrates that the proposed method achieves remarkable latency reduction than several benchmark methods.",

To address this issue, we develop a refined sliding method suited to mixed local-nonlocal operators. As key technical ingredients, we establish new generalized weighted average inequalities, narrow region principles, and maximum principles in bounded and unbounded domains.\n  These tools enable us to derive monotonicity and one-dimensional symmetry results for mixed elliptic equations in bounded domains, half-spaces, and the whole space, and to extend the analysis to parabolic equations with mixed time derivatives. As an application, we resolve the Gibbons' conjecture for a class of mixed fractional equations.",

We give the first such interpretation, with two main results: (i) a complete combinatorial interpretation for r = 1/2 and n = 1,2,3, and (ii) a rigorous proof that this interpretation cannot extend to n >= 4 within the same framework. For n = 1,2,3, we show that the coefficients for r = 1/2 count binary sequences satisfying two conditions: they contain at least one symbol B, and they have gap <= 1, where the gap is the distance between the first and last occurrence of B. Each sequence is assigned a type k by a parity-dependent rule involving the gap value, and exhaustive enumeration matches Katugampola's coefficients exactly. We then prove an obstruction theorem showing that the gap <= 1 condition forces any such model to produce at most two distinct types per row, whereas Katugampola's array requires at least three types for every n >= 4. Thus the gap <= 1 binary-sequence interpretation works if and only if n = 1,2,3.

    "abstract": "We develop an entropy-stable high-order numerical method for the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations on general curvilinear meshes. The proposed approach is based on a nodal discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method (DGSEM) that satisfies the summation-by-parts (SBP) property. At the semidiscrete level, entropy stability is established through the SBP structure and the discrete metric identities associated with curvilinear coordinate mappings. By incorporating entropy-stable numerical fluxes at element interfaces, a global discrete entropy inequality is obtained. To further control nonphysical oscillations near strong discontinuities, the entropy-stable DG formulation is combined with a modified oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (OEDG) method, which was originally proposed in [59]. We observe that the zero-order damping coefficient in the original OEDG method naturally serves as an effective shock indicator, which enables localization of the oscillation control mechanism and significantly reduces computational cost. Moreover, while the original OEDG formulation relies on local orthogonal modal bases and is primarily restricted to simplicial meshes, we reformulate the OE procedure using projection operators, allowing for a systematic extension to general curvilinear meshes. The resulting method preserves conservation and entropy stability while effectively suppressing spurious oscillations. A series of challenging numerical experiments is presented to demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed entropy-stable OEDG method on both Cartesian and curvilinear meshes.",

Motivated by the seminal work of Green and Tao (2013) on the Sylvester-Gallai theorem, we investigate the quantitative and structural properties of monochromatic geometric objects, such as lines, circles, and conics.\n  We first show that if no line contains more than three points, then for all sufficiently large $n$ there are at least $n^{2}/24 - O(1)$ monochromatic lines. We then show a converse of a theorem of Jamison (1986): Given $n\\ge 6$ blue points and $n$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all red points are collinear. We also settle the smallest nontrivial case of a conjecture of Mili\u0107evi\u0107 (2018) by showing that if we have $5$ blue points with no three collinear and $5$ red points, if the blue points lie on a conic and every line through two blue points contains a red point, then all $10$ points lie on a cubic curve. Further, we analyze the random setting and show that, for any non-collinear set of $n\\ge 10$ points independently colored red or blue, the expected number of monochromatic lines is minimized by the \\emph{near-pencil} configuration.

We establish a tight non-asymptotic instance-dependent lower bound on the expected stopping time of any valid sequential test under the alternative. Our novel analysis improves the existing lower bounds, which are either asymptotic or provably sub-optimal in this setting. Our lower bound incorporates both the stationary distribution and the transition structure induced by the unknown Markov chain. We further propose an optimal test whose expected stopping time matches this lower bound asymptotically as $\u03b1\\to 0$. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework through applications to sequential detection of model misspecification in Markov Chain Monte Carlo and to testing structural properties, such as the linearity of transition dynamics, in Markov decision processes.

In the two-input case, prior work established precise links between relative degrees, the highest derivative orders occurring in a flat parameterization, and the minimal dimension of a linearizing dynamic extension, leading to necessary and sufficient criteria for systems that become static feedback linearizable after at most two prolongations of such suitably chosen inputs.

We propose decentralized methods wherein agents {\\it adaptively} adjust their stepsize via local backtracking procedures coupled with lightweight min-consensus protocols. Our design stems from a three-operator splitting factorization applied to an equivalent reformulation of the problem. The reformulation is endowed with a new BCV preconditioning metric (Bertsekas-O'Connor-Vandenberghe), which enables efficient decentralized implementation and local stepsize adjustments. We establish robust convergence guarantees. Under mere convexity, the proposed methods converge with a sublinear rate. Under strong convexity of the sum-function, and assuming the nonsmooth component is partly smooth, we further prove linear convergence. Numerical experiments corroborate the theory and highlight the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive stepsize strategy.",

The goal of this paper is to study the scattering effect of binary and near-triple collisions in a simple setting -- the isosceles three-body problem. The details depend on the mass parameters but in many cases, a fixed isosceles initial shape $s_-$ scatters to essentially all possible isosceles shapes $s_+$.",

We introduce generalised versions of these inequalities for arbitrary positive measures on a finite state space, retaining key structural properties of their classical counterparts. In particular, we prove continuity of the associated constants with respect to the reference measure and establish explicit positive lower bounds.

We prove well-posedness of the model in a strong probabilistic sense, and analyze its long-time behavior in terms of existence and uniqueness of invariant measures, ergodicity, and mixing properties.

    "abstract": "The dynamic programming approach is one of the most powerful ones in optimal control. However, when dealing with optimal control problems of stochastic Volterra integral equations (SVIEs) with completely monotone kernels, deep mathematical difficulties arise and it is still not understood. These very classical problems have applications in most fields and have now become even more popular due to their applications in mathematical finance under rough volatility. In this article, we consider a class of optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. Via a recent Markovian lift \\cite{FGW2024}, the problem can be reformulated as an optimal control problem of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on suitable Hilbert spaces, which due to the roughness of the kernel, presents a generator of an analytic semigroup and unbounded control and diffusion operators.\n  This analysis leads us to study a general class of optimal control problems of abstract SDEs on Hilbert spaces with unbounded control and diffusion operators. This class includes optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels, but it is also motivated by other models. We analyze the regularity of the associated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck transition semigroup. We prove that the semigroup exhibits a new smoothing property in control directions through a general observation operator $\u0393$, which we call $\u0393$-smoothing. This allows us to establish existence and uniqueness of mild solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, establish a verification theorem, and construct optimal feedback controls. We apply these results to optimal control problems of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results of this kind for this abstract class of infinite dimensional problems and for the optimal control of SVIEs with completely monotone kernels.",

    "abstract": "Self-distillation (SD) is the process of retraining a student on a mixture of ground-truth labels and the teacher's own predictions using the same architecture and training data. Although SD has been empirically shown to often improve generalization, its formal guarantees remain limited. We study SD for ridge regression in unconstrained setting in which the mixing weight $\u03be$ may be outside the unit interval. Conditioned on the training data and without any distributional assumptions, we prove that for any squared prediction risk (including out-of-distribution), the optimally mixed student strictly improves upon the ridge teacher for every regularization level $\u03bb> 0$ at which the teacher ridge risk $R(\u03bb)$ is nonstationary (i.e., $R'(\u03bb) \\neq 0$). We obtain a closed-form expression for the optimal mixing weight $\u03be^\\star(\u03bb)$ for any value of $\u03bb$ and show that it obeys the sign rule: $\\operatorname{sign}(\u03be^\\star(\u03bb))=-\\operatorname{sign}(R'(\u03bb))$. In particular, $\u03be^\\star(\u03bb)$ can be negative, which is the case in over-regularized regimes. To quantify the risk improvement due to SD, we derive exact deterministic equivalents for the optimal SD risk in the proportional asymptotics regime (where the sample and feature sizes $n$ and $p$ both diverge but their aspect ratio $p/n$ converges) under general anisotropic covariance and deterministic signals. Our asymptotic analysis extends standard second-order ridge deterministic equivalents to their fourth-order analogs using block linearization, which may be of independent interest. From a practical standpoint, we propose a consistent one-shot tuning method to estimate $\u03be^\\star$ without grid search, sample splitting, or refitting. Experiments on real-world datasets and pretrained neural network features support our theory and the one-shot tuning method.",

Although effective in practice, its mathematical structure and potential for parallelization have remained unexplored. In this work, we establish a rigorous functional-analytic foundation for the TV-Stokes model. We formulate both steps in appropriate infinite-dimensional function spaces, derive their dual formulations, and analyze the compatibility and mathematical consistency of the coupled system. In particular, we identify analytical inconsistencies in the original formulation and demonstrate how an alternative model resolves them. We also examine the orthogonal projection onto the divergence-free subspace, proving its existence in a continuous setting and establishing consistency with its discrete counterpart.\n  Building on this theoretical framework, we develop the first domain decomposition method for TV-Stokes by applying overlapping Schwarz-type iterations to the duals of both steps. Although the divergence-free constraint gives rise to a global projection operator in the continuous model, we show that it becomes locally computable in the discrete setting. This insight enables a fully parallelizable algorithm suitable for large-scale image processing in memory-constrained environments. Numerical experiments demonstrate the correctness of the domain decomposition approach and its usability in parallel image reconstruction.",

We subsume this game under a more general class of games on abstract Polish spaces with pairwise interactions, and prove that the latter games have a variational structure (in the sense that their equilibria can be characterized as critical points of some potential functional) and admit equilibria. We also discuss two a priori distinct notions of equilibria, providing a sufficient condition under which both notions coincide.
