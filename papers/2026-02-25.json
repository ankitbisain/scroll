    "title": "On the P\u00f3lya Frequency Order of the de Bruijn Newman Kernel. Certified Failure at Order Five and the Toeplitz Threshold Phenomenon",
    "abstract": "We study the classical de Bruijn--Newman kernel K(u)=Phi(|u|) arising in the heat-flow deformation of the Riemann xi-function. We prove that K is not a Polya frequency function of order five (PF_5). The proof is computational and fully rigorous: we exhibit an explicit 5x5 Toeplitz minor whose determinant is strictly negative, certified by interval arithmetic at high precision with explicit control of truncation and rounding errors. At the same configuration we certify positivity of all Toeplitz minors of orders 2, 3, and 4, demonstrating a sharp Toeplitz PF threshold at order 5 for this two-parameter family. To explain the mechanism, we develop a Toeplitz reduction and an asymptotic expansion as the grid spacing h -> 0, leading to a leading coefficient C_r(u0) whose sign governs the small-h behavior of the Toeplitz determinant. Numerically, we find C_r(u0) > 0 for r <= 4 on the tested range, while C_5(u0) < 0 for u0 in (0, u0*) with a critical transition near u0* ~= 0.03113976; in contrast, C_6 and C_7 are positive at representative points, indicating a localized failure specific to order five. We also investigate the Gaussian deformation K_t(u)=exp(t u^2)*Phi(|u|) and compute, for each counterexample configuration, the minimal t >= 0 that restores Toeplitz PF_5 positivity, emphasizing that this configuration-dependent threshold is distinct from the de Bruijn--Newman constant.",

    "title": "A unified solution framework for truck-and-drone routing problems",
    "abstract": "Coordinated truck-and-drone routing integrates the high capacity and range of ground vehicles with the flexible routing and speed of drones, enabling simultaneous service. Increasingly applied in last-mile delivery, this synchronization helps reduce completion time and operational costs. To improve its efficiency, various coordination modes between trucks and drones have been proposed. Each mode accommodates diverse operational constraints tailored to particular delivery requirements. In existing work, a slight change in the structural framework or operational characteristics could generate a totally different problem variant, which often requires the design of specialized algorithms. Consequently, under the requirement of maintaining structural validation and adapting to multiple operational features, this paper presents a unified three-phase solution framework based on the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun algorithm to solve a wide family of truck-and-drone routing problems. To validate its flexibility and effectiveness, we carry out numerical experiments on three problem variants: the Flying Sidekick Traveling Salesman Problem (FSTSP), the Traveling Salesman Problem with Multiple Drones (TSP-mD), and the Vehicle Routing Problem with Drones (VRP-D), benchmarking each against an effective algorithm. Computational results show that the framework can closely match optimal solutions on small-size instances and even improve the best-known solutions for several medium-size instances. Moreover, additional extensions are discussed to further highlight its versatility.",

This provides a purely algebraic linearization of the multiplicative prime-wise structure of the Euler product.\n  Starting from a finite cutoff model, we introduce a formal completion via evenization and a natural normalization procedure. The resulting logarithmic expansion exhibits a Gaussian leading term, while higher-order terms form a hierarchy of cumulants. We show that this Gaussian structure is not probabilistic in origin, but arises from the infinitesimal quadratic geometry of the multiplicative formal group after linearization. The higher cumulants encode arithmetic deviations and admit a decomposition governed by weighted integrals of the Chebyshev error function $\u03b8(x)-x$.\n  A systematic formal group axiomatization is then provided, placing the cutoff model and cumulant hierarchy within a coherent algebraic framework. The approach is deliberately non-spectral, focusing on a structural reorganization of the Euler product rather than on operator-theoretic realizations of zeros.

    "abstract": "We study translation-invariant smoothing operators on finite cyclic groups Z/NZ, expressed as periodic convolutions and analyzed via the discrete Fourier transform on Z/NZ. Step responses are widely used as a practical diagnostic for whether a smoothing operator preserves bounded ranges, for example whether it maps signals in [0,1]^N back into [0,1]^N. We show step-based diagnostics can be fundamentally misleading for periodic convolution operators. First, we give a sharp characterization: a constant-preserving periodic convolution maps [0,1]^N into [0,1]^N if and only if its convolution kernel is componentwise nonnegative, equivalently each row of the associated matrix is a probability vector. The proof is constructive and yields worst-case witnesses in {0,1}^N together with certified lower bounds on the magnitude of boundedness violation. We then analyze three standard Fourier-domain averaging constructions, Fejer (Ces\u00e0ro) averaging, sharp spectral truncation, and a signed spectral control, and demonstrate a Nyquist-adjacent blind spot: at cutoff K = Nyquist - 1, the canonical step can exhibit essentially zero overshoot while the operator remains strongly non-admissible, with explicit binary inputs yielding outputs below 0 and above 1. Reproducible artifacts and a self-contained demo are provided.",

    "title": "Quantile-Based Skewness for Fuzzy Numbers with Probabilistic Foundations: With an Application in Portfolio Optimization",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel parameter free skewness coefficient for fuzzy numbers, addressing a critical gap in quantifying asymmetry under imprecision. Existing fuzzy literature substitutes membership functions for probability density functions in moment-based skewness, lacking rigorous theoretical grounding. Our coefficient, however, rigorously establishes a probabilistic foundation, making it both probabilistically meaningful and fully compliant with the semantics of fuzzy set theory. Our approach interprets a fuzzy number's left and right membership function components as cumulative and survival probability functions of associated random variables. This provides a robust probabilistic foundation for its $\u03b1$-cuts as generalized quantiles representing values that are \"at least $\u03b1$-probable\", thereby instantiating the well-grounded dualism between probability and possibility theory. As a quantile-based measure, the proposed coefficient offers invariance under scale and location transformations. Crucially, its superior computational efficiency, empirically demonstrating an almost logarithmic reduction in portfolio optimization processing time with increasing assets, enables significant scalability for real-world applications. The coefficient comprises two complementary constituents: an \"inner\" measure quantifying the intrinsic skewness of the underlying probabilistic distributions, and an \"outer\" measure capturing the fuzzy number's overall profile asymmetry. This dual structure offers nuanced insights into a fuzzy number's asymmetry. We demonstrate its practical utility and computational advantages within a fuzzy mean-variance-skewness portfolio optimization framework, comparing its performance with two of the most highly cited original moment-based fuzzy skewness coefficients from the literature.",

Here, the Hodge vector of a lattice polytope is its local $h^*$-vector with leading and trailing zeroes removed. This result allows finding infinitely many high-dimensional lattice polytopes with the same Hodge vector that are not free joins. The proof relies on a closed formula for the Hodge-Deligne polynomial of generic complete intersections in the torus in terms of the bivariate/mixed $h^*$-polynomial. A special case of our construction is what we call Lawrence twists: extending the Gale transform by centrally-symmetric pairs of vectors. As applications, we can produce many new thin polytopes answering a question by Borger, Kretschmer and the second author, and we provide an alternative explanation of the thinness of $B_k$-polytopes answering a question of Selyanin.",

    "abstract": "This study presents a closed-form analytical solution for the elastostatic response of long cylindrical shells composed of microstructured materials within the framework of the isotropic relaxed micromorphic continuum. The formulation accounts for microstructural effects by introducing an independent micro-distortion tensor field in addition to the classical displacement field. Under the assumptions of axisymmetric deformation and plane strain conditions, the governing equilibrium equations reduce to a coupled system of ordinary differential equations in the radial coordinate. By introducing suitable auxiliary variables, the system is reformulated into a non-homogeneous modified Bessel equation, which admits an exact analytical solution. Explicit expressions are derived for the radial displacement field and the non-zero components of the micro-distortion tensor. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the influence of material parameters and the characteristic length on the displacement. The results demonstrate that the relaxed micromorphic model predicts deviations from classical elasticity where microstructural effects are more pronounced. The obtained solution provides valuable physical insight into the mechanics of cylindrical shells and serves as a benchmark for validating numerical implementations of relaxed micromorphic models.",

We establish the existence of the solutions to these BSDEs by BMO analysis and comparison theorem for multi-dimensional BSDEs. Next, we establish that the optimal control problem is well posed, in the sense that the value function is finite and the optimal strategy-when it exists-is unique. This is achieved by reformulating the cost functional as the sum of a quadratic functional and the candidate value function.

For all possible degenerate points on the free surface, we prove that the only nontrivial asymptotic behavior of the free surface at the stagnation points away from the axis of symmetry is the Stokes corner flow. The possible geometries for free boundaries at the non-stagnation axis points are downward pointing or upward pointing cusps. At the origin, there are only two nontrivial asymptotics possible: the Garabedian's pointed bubble or a horizontal flat surface.\n  The problem is associated with the analysis of the degenerate points of a quasilinear free boundary problem of the Bernoulli type, and the main obstacles are the absence of a Weiss-type monotonicity formula. To achieve our goal, we establish for the first time monotonicity formulas for quasilinear Bernoulli type free boundary problems. Our formula works both when the equation becomes singular and when the free boundary condition is degenerate.\n  Moreover, we establish a new nonlinear frequency formula at the horizontal flat points at the origin and integrate it with the compensated compactness theory for Euler equations, ensuring the strong convergence of variational solutions.\n  Our results resolve the Stokes conjecture [Mathematical and Physical Papers, Vol. I., 1880] in a generalized compressible, three dimensional axisymmetric framework. In addition, it can also be realized as a compressible counterpart to V\u01cerv\u01ceruc\u01ce and Weiss [Comm. Pure Appl. Math., (67), 2014].

    "title": "The largest 5th pivot may be the root of a 61st degree polynomial",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces a number of new techniques in the study of the famous question from numerical linear algebra: what is the largest possible growth factor when performing Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting? This question is highly complex, due to a complicated set of polynomial inequalities that need to be simultaneously satisfied. This paper introduces the JuMP + Groebner basis + discriminant polynomial approach as well as the use of interval arithmetic computations. Thus, we are introducing a marriage of numerical and exact mathematical computations.\n  In 1988, Day and Peterson performed numerical optimization on $n=5$ with NPSOL and obtained a largest seen value of $4.1325...$. This same best value was reproduced by Gould with LANCELOT in 1991. We ran extensive comparable experiments with the modern software tool JuMP and also saw the same value $4.1325...$. While the combinatorial explosion of possibilities prevents us from knowing there may not be a larger maximum, we succeed in obtaining the exact mathematical value: the number $4.1325...$ is exactly the root of a 61st degree polynomial provided in this work, and is a maximum given the equality constraints seen by JuMP. In light of the numerics, we pose the conjecture that this lower bound is indeed the maximum. We also apply this technique to $n = 6$, $7$, and $8$.\n  Furthermore, in 1969, an upper bound of $4\\frac{17}{18}\\approx 4.94$ was produced for the maximum possible growth for $n = 5$. We slightly lower this upper bound to $4.84$.",

    "title": "On the Height Profile of Analog Error-Correcting Codes",
    "abstract": "In recent work, it has been shown that maintaining reliability in analog vector--matrix multipliers can be modeled as the following coding problem. Vectors in $\\mathbb{R}^k$ are encoded into codewords of a linear $[n,k,d]$ code $C$ over $\\mathbb{R}$. For prescribed positive reals $\u03b4< \u0394$, additive errors of magnitude at most $\u03b4$ are tolerable and need no handling, yet outlying errors of magnitude greater than $\u0394$ are to be located or detected. The trade-off between the ratio $\u0394/\u03b4$ and the number of outlying errors that can be handled is determined by the height profile of $C$; as such, the height profile provides a finer description of the error handling capability of $C$, compared to the minimum distance $d$, which only determines the number of correctable errors. This work contains a further study of the notion of the height profile. Several characterizations of the height profile are presented, thereby yielding methods for computing it. The starting point is formulating this computation as an optimization problem that is solved by a set of linear programs. This, in turn, leads to a combinatorial characterization of the height profile as a maximum (or max--min) over a certain finite set of codewords of $C$. Moreover, this characterization is shown to have a simple geometric interpretation when the columns of the generator matrix of $C$ all have the same $L_2$ norm. Through examples of several code families, it is demonstrated how the results herein can be used to compute the height profile explicitly.",

    "title": "Memory reshapes stability landscapes: resilience-resistance tradeoffs and critical transitions",
    "abstract": "Regime shifts in biology, ecology, and other complex systems are often interpreted through stability landscapes and early warning signals that implicitly assume dynamics without memory effects. Yet many real systems exhibit these effects, thus present dynamics depend on past states and past forcing. Here, we study how memory reshapes bistable stability landscapes and regime shifts using a minimal bistable model with a fractional derivative that controls memory strength. We connect landscape geometry to classical notions of resilience and resistance by quantifying basin curvature and the perturbation magnitude required to cross the unstable threshold, and we track how these quantities evolve in time after perturbations. Memory typically flattens basin floors, slowing recovery, while often increasing the perturbation threshold for stability transitions, revealing a tradeoff between resilience and resistance. Because the landscape becomes history-dependent and time-evolving, memory generates qualitative behaviors that do not appear in memory-free models, including delayed collapse or recovery after stress ends, rebound after apparently successful transition, and broadened hysteresis under gradual parameter change. Finally, we show that fitting a memory-free model to memory-driven data can reproduce trajectories while systematically shifting equilibrium branches and tipping locations, risking incorrect diagnosis and management of regime shifts. These results motivate a moving landscape view and provide practical guidance for interpreting observed anomalies and distinguishing memory-driven effects from noise.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study stochastic constrained minimax optimization problems with nonconvex-nonconcave structure, a central problem in modern machine learning, for which reliable and efficient algorithms remain largely unexplored due to its inherent challenges. Prior approaches for nonconvex minimax optimization often require (strong) concavity on the maximization part, or certain restrictive geometric assumptions on the joint objective to have guaranteed convergence. In contrast, our method only assumes weak convexity in the primal variable and the extended Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property, with exponent $\u03b8\\in [0,1]$, in the dual variable, significantly broadening the class of tractable problems. To this end, we propose a variance reduced algorithm that provably handles this general setting and achieves an $\\varepsilon$-stationary solution with state-of-the-art sample complexity: in the smooth finite-sum setting, the sample complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{N}\\,\\varepsilon^{-\\max\\{4\u03b8,2\\}}\\right)$, where $N$ is the number of total samples, and in the online smooth setting, it is $\\mathcal{O}\\Big(\\varepsilon^{-\\max\\{6\u03b8,3\\}}\\Big)$. For the structured nonsmooth problem, the sample complexity is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{N}\\,\\max\\Big\\{\\varepsilon^{-3}, \\varepsilon^{-5\u03b8}, \\varepsilon^{-\\frac{11\u03b8-3}{2\u03b8}}\\Big\\}\\right)$ and $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\max\\left\\{\\varepsilon^{-4}, \\varepsilon^{-\\frac{15\u03b8-1}{2}}, \\varepsilon^{-\\frac{31\u03b8-9}{4\u03b8}}\\right\\}\\right)$ respectively for the two settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that jointly accommodates weak convexity, the extended KL property, and variance-reduced stochastic updates, making it highly suitable for large-scale applications.",

In this paper, we show that some of these classical equalities do not hold in general. We present explicit counterexamples disproving the published results concerning independence and vertex cover numbers of splitting graphs. Moreover, we establish the correct formulas and precisely characterize the cases in which the original statements are valid and those in which they fail. These results correct an error that has remained unnoticed for more than four decades and provide a clearer understanding of splitting graphs from the perspective of independence and vertex cover number.",

    "abstract": "Consider the point process (in $\\mathbb{R}^d$) of local maxima of smooth Gaussian fields, with sufficient decay of correlation at infinity, above a level $u$. We show that this point process, rescaled appropriately, converges weakly to a Poisson point process in the limit $u \\to \\infty$. Our proof relies on the classical observation that simple point processes are characterised by avoidance probabilities (i.e. $\\mathbb{P}(\u03b7(B)=0)$ for a point process $\u03b7$ and Borel set $B$). Then we approximate avoidance probability with the excursion probability, where the latter is well studied. Second main result is a quantified version of the Poisson convergence of high local maxima of the Bargmann-Fock field in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. We prove that, for Bargmann-Fock field in two dimensions, the total variation distance between a Poisson random variable and the number of local maxima of the field above a threshold $u$ in an $R \\times R$ box in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ decays like $\\exp(- \u03b2u^2)$, for some fixed $\u03b2>0$. As an immediate consequence, when the level $u$ is a function of $R$ such that $u(R) \\to \\infty$ and $u(R)/ \\sqrt{\\log R} \\to 0$ as $R \\to \\infty$, we have a quantitative central limit theorem for the number of high local maxima. The proof is based on the Chen-Stein method for quantitative Poisson approximation.

The numerical scheme uses a global centre-manifold reduction, where the solution to the QCGLE is constructed as the sum of the individual pulses plus a remainder function, which is chosen to be orthogonal to the zero adjoint eigenmodes of the QCGLE linear operator. Projecting this constructed solution onto the stable centre-manifold leads to a fast-slow system of equations consisting of {\\it slow} ordinary differential equations for the position and phases of the individual pulses and a {\\it fast} partial differential equation for the remainder function. By considering the pulses to be well-separated, the system can be expanded asymptotically in terms of the small parameter $\u03b5=e^{-\u03bb_r d}\\ll1$, where $\u03bb_r$ is the spatial decay rate of the pulse, and $d>0$ is the minimum pulse separation distance. Here the remainder function is determined via a stationary partial differential equation that can be readily solved in an efficient manner using GMRES. Results for $N=2,3,4$ and $5$ pulses are considered, and it is found that different equilibrium solutions are possible such as stable fixed points and limit cycles. The interaction of two stable $N=3$ coherent structures is also considered, where the common tendency found is for the structure to degenerate into pairs of pulses which propagate away from the initial configuration of pulses.",

The algorithm performs clustering of macroscopic deformations into subsets called \"centroids\", and, as a new ingredient, approximates the homogenized coefficients using sensitivity analysis of micro-configurations with respect to the macroscopic deformation. The novel \"model-order reduction\" approach significantly reduces the number of microscopic problems that must be solved in nonlinear simulations, thereby accelerating the overall computational process. The degree of reduction can be controlled by a user-defined error tolerance parameter. The algorithm is implemented in the finite element framework SfePy, and its performance effectiveness is demonstrated using two-dimensional test examples, when compared with solutions obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition method, and by the full \"FE-square\" simulations.

We show that there is a stable equivalence of Morita type between the hyperfocal subalgebras of the hyperfocal abelian Frobenius blocks and a group algebra of a Frobenius group associated with the hyperfocal subgroup of the block. As applications, we can partially describe some structures of the blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups and cyclic hyperfocal subgroups,such as the structures of their hyperfocal subalgebras in terms of derived categories and the structures of their characters. As a consequence, we show that Broue's abelian defect group conjecture holds for blocks with Klein four hyperfocal subgroups.",

    "abstract": "In continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs), careful consideration of the underlying physics is essential, among which electromagnetic (EM) mutual coupling plays a critical role in beamforming performance. Building on a physically consistent mutual coupling model, the beamforming design is formulated as a functional optimization whose optimality condition leads to a Fredholm integral equation. The incorporation of the coupling model, however, substantially increases computational complexity, necessitating efficient and accurate integral equation solvers. In this letter, we propose two efficient solvers: 1) a coordinate-transformation-based kernel approximation that preserves the operator structure while alleviating discretization demands, and 2) a direct lower-upper (LU)-based solver that stably handles the Nystr\u00f6m-discretized system. Numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to conventional methods, with the LU-based solver emerging as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale CAPA optimization via offline factorization.",

    "title": "Statistical Inference in Causal Partial Identification with Smooth Densities",
    "abstract": "Many causal quantities are only partially identifiable due to the inherent missingness of potential outcomes, and the associated partial identification (PI) sets can be obtained by solving an optimal transport (OT) problem. Covariates often provide additional information about the potential outcomes and thus yield tighter PI sets, which can be obtained via conditional optimal transport (COT). However, COT-based PI set estimators are susceptible to the curse of dimensionality in the covariates and outcomes, which precludes the asymptotic normality and hinders statistical inference. In this paper, we exploit smoothness in the marginal densities of covariates and potential outcomes and develop a wavelet-based primal method for COT with multivariate outcomes and covariates. Moreover, for quadratic cost functions, we establish a stability result for COT and prove asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. This characterization of the asymptotic distribution enables valid statistical inference for the partial identification set. Empirically, we validate the estimation and inference performance of our approach through numerical experiments in comparison with existing benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been increasingly explored for receiver design because they can handle complex environments without relying on explicit channel models. Nevertheless, because communication channels change rapidly, their distributions can shift over time, often making periodic retraining necessary. This paper proposes a zero-overhead online and continual learning framework for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) neural receivers that directly detect the soft bits of received signals. Unlike conventional fine-tuning methods that rely on dedicated training intervals or full resource grids, our approach leverages existing demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to simultaneously enable signal demodulation and model adaptation. We introduce three pilot designs: fully randomized, hybrid, and additional pilots that flexibly support joint demodulation and learning. To accommodate these pilot designs, we develop two receiver architectures: (i) a parallel design that separates inference and fine-tuning for uninterrupted operation, and (ii) a forward-pass reusing design that reduces computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed method effectively tracks both slow and fast channel distribution variations without additional overhead, service interruption, or catastrophic performance degradation under distribution shift.",

We propose FD-MGDL, an adaptive framework integrating finite difference schemes with Multi-Grade Deep Learning to efficiently resolve high-frequency solutions. While traditional PINNs struggle with spectral bias and automatic differentiation overhead, FD-MGDL employs a progressive training strategy, incrementally adding hidden layers to refine the solution and maintain stability. Crucially, when using ReLU activation, our algorithm recasts the highly non-convex training problem into a sequence of convex subproblems. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D with wavenumbers up to $\u03ba=200$ show that FD-MGDL significantly outperforms single-grade and conventional neural solvers in accuracy and speed. Applied to an inhomogeneous concave velocity model, the framework accurately resolves wave focusing and caustics, surpassing the 5-point finite difference method in capturing sharp phase transitions and amplitude spikes. These results establish FD-MGDL as a robust, scalable solver for high-frequency wave equations in complex domains.",

    "abstract": "We study stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for composite optimization problems with $N$ sequential operators subject to perturbations in both the forward and backward passes. Unlike classical analyses that treat gradient noise as additive and localized, perturbations to intermediate outputs and gradients cascade through the computational graph, compounding geometrically with the number of operators. We present the first comprehensive theoretical analysis of this setting. Specifically, we characterize how forward and backward perturbations propagate and amplify within a single gradient step, derive convergence guarantees for both general non-convex objectives and functions satisfying the Polyak--\u0141ojasiewicz condition, and identify conditions under which perturbations do not deteriorate the asymptotic convergence order. As a byproduct, our analysis furnishes a theoretical explanation for the gradient spiking phenomenon widely observed in deep learning, precisely characterizing the conditions under which training recovers from spikes or diverges. Experiments on logistic regression with convex and non-convex regularization validate our theories, illustrating the predicted spike behavior and the asymmetric sensitivity to forward versus backward perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Rota-Baxter operators and bialgebras are closely connected in several applications, such as the Connes-Kreimer renormalization framework and the operator approach to the classical Yang-Baxter equation. The concept of a Rota-Baxter system was introduced in 2016 as a generalization of a Rota-Baxter operator. In this work, we introduce a bialgebra structure compatible with a symmetric Rota-Baxter system, called a symmetric Rota-Baxter antisymmetric infinitesimal (ASI) bisystem. This bialgebra is characterized by generalizations of matched pairs of algebras and double constructions of Frobenius algebras to the setting of symmetric Rota-Baxter systems. Investigating the coboundary case leads to an enriched version of the associative Yang-Baxter equation (aYBe) adapted to symmetric Rota-Baxter systems. Antisymmetric solutions of this equation are used to construct symmetric Rota-Baxter ASI bisystems. We also introduce the notion of an $\\mathcal{O}$-operator on a symmetric Rota-Baxter system, which produces solutions of the admissible aYBe in such systems and thereby gives rise to symmetric Rota-Baxter ASI bisystems. A symmetric Rota-Baxter bisystem generalizes several known structures, including Rota-Baxter Lie bisystems, Rota-Baxter ASI bialgebras, Rota-Baxter Lie bialgebras, averaging ASI bialgebras, averaging Lie bialgebras, and special apre-perm bialgebras.",

The second is based on a symmetric representation and Newton-type iterations. We propose numerical implementations for both methodologies that avoid working with dense matrices and maintain low memory consumption. Furthermore, we study both types of embeddings numerically using real data from publicly available datasets. The results show that our algorithms yield a good approximation of the SimRank matrices, both in terms of the error norm (particularly the Chebyshev norm) and in preserving the average number of the most similar elements for each given node.",

They are important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science, yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant alphabet size.\n  In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (SICOMP 2006) show how to construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs.\n  In this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting. We prove an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making $2$ queries (even adaptively) over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021) and is the first exponential lower bound for RLDCs. Combined with the results of Ben-Sasson et al., our result exhibits a ``phase-transition''-type behavior on the codeword length for some constant-query complexity. We achieve these lower bounds via a transformation of RLDCs to standard Hamming LDCs, using a careful analysis of restrictions of message bits that fix codeword bits.",

We start with a finite-dimensional construction which extends to Wright-Fisher diffusions a self-similarity property known for Dirichlet distributions, and corresponds to a multiple skew-product representation of the Wright-Fisher diffusion relative to the marks in the population. After ranking decreasingly the frequencies within each mark, we identify the limit in distribution of the resulting diffusion when the number of types for each mark goes to infinity, and describe its infinitesimal operator. The limiting process reduces to a diffusion in the Thoma simplex in the special case of only two marks, whereas the infinitely-many-neutral-alleles model is recovered when all frequencies have the same mark. The stationary measure of the limit diffusion is shown to be the recently introduced multiple Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, which extends Kingman's Poisson-Dirichlet distribution and is the de Finetti representing measure for a family of random partitions whose elements are marked.",

Finally, the simultaneous equality cases involving both tensor fields $T$ and $A$ along the horizontal and vertical distributions imply the integrability of the horizontal distribution together with the invariantly quasi-umbilical nature of the fibres and the commutativity of the corresponding shape operators.",

First, we prove that Poisson homeomorphisms preserve the singular symplectic foliation: they map symplectic leaves to symplectic leaves by symplectic homeomorphisms. Second, we establish the $C^0$-rigidity of coisotropic submanifolds in Poisson manifolds. A key ingredient is the notion of ''clean intersection point'' between a submanifold and the leaves of a singular foliation, whose study is of independent interest for singular foliation theory and Poisson geometry. In contrast with the symplectic case, characteristic foliations of coisotropic submanifolds are not rigid under Poisson homeomorphisms, exhibiting flexibility phenomena specific to the Poisson setting. We discuss partial rigidity results, introduce a topological invariant of coisotropic submanifolds, the $C^0$-characteristic partition, and show that $C^0$-coisotropic submanifolds are non-smooth objects whose vanishing ideal defines a Lie subalgebra of the Poisson algebra. Finally, we consider Poisson homeomorphisms that lift to symplectic homeomorphisms of a symplectic realization and show that nearly all Poisson manifolds admit non-liftable Poisson homeomorphisms.

Our method relies on a non-parametric Bayesian formulation based on the Dirichlet process and the Bayesian bootstrap. We show that the marginal posterior of the targeted parameter exhibits good frequentist properties despite not accounting for the inferential uncertainty of the nuisance parameter. We adopt this approach in Bayesian causal inference problems where the nuisance propensity score model is estimated to obtain marginal inference for the treatment effect parameter, and demonstrate that a plug-in of the propensity score has a negligible effect on marginal posterior inference for the causal contrast. We investigate the absence of Neyman orthogonality and exploit our findings to show that in conventional two-step procedures, the posterior distribution converges under weaker restrictions than those needed in the frequentist sequel. For a simple family of useful scores, we demonstrate that even in the absence of Neyman orthogonality, the posterior distribution is asymptotically unchanged by the estimation of the nuisance parameter, merely provided the latter estimator is consistent.",

We introduce the logic $\\mathcal{B}_4^\\circ$, a four-valued Boolean logic augmented with the consistency operator, and provide a sound and complete axiomatization. Building on this foundation, we extend the semantics to the modal domain using the many-logics modal logic (MLML) framework. Specifically, we construct Kripke frames based on an eight-valued Boolean algebra that contains three distinct four-valued subalgebras, each representing a different world type. Our analysis reveals that the resulting modal logic exhibits a normal local consequence relation alongside a non-normal global consequence relation. Consequently, the characterization of frame properties --such as transitivity, reflexivity, and Euclideanness --deviates from modal logic $K$, requiring novel semantic tools. We further identify new modal formulas in an extended language that capture previously unavailable kinds of accessibility, leading to frame characterizations unattainable in traditional modal frameworks.",

First, we investigate the necessary conditions for existence of the solutions with concentration phenomena directed along closed smooth curves. Next, not only imposing stationary and non-degeneracy conditions on the curves with respect to an auxiliary weighted length involving the trap potential, but also adding some other technical assumptions, we select a sequence $\\{\u03bb_j\\}$ of the frequency $\u03bb$ with $-\u03bb_j\\rightarrow +\\infty$ and construct solutions with concentration directed along the curves. Our result partially answers the conjecture raised in [A. Ambrosetti, A. Malchiodi, W.-M. Ni, Comm. Math. Phys. 2003] about necessary condition for solution concentrating at submanifolds. The solutions constructed in this paper are concentrating on curves whose length are non-uniformly bounded, and hence the situation is quite different from that in [M. del Pino, M. Kowalczyk, J.

In addition, new practices in digital simulation require predictions accompanied by confidence intervals. Models based on Gaussian processes (GPs) provide principled uncertainty quantification. However, GPs capable of jointly handling functional covariates and multiple correlated functional tasks remain largely under-explored. In this work, we extend the framework of GPs with functional covariates to multitask problems by introducing a fully separable kernel structure that captures dependencies across tasks and functional inputs. By taking advantage of the Kronecker structure of the covariance matrix, the model is made scalable. The proposed model is validated on a synthetic benchmark and applied to a realistic structure, a riveted assembly with functional descriptions of the material behaviour and response forces. The proposed functional multitask GP significantly improves over single task GPs. For the riveted assembly, it requires less than 100 samples to produce an accurate mean and confidence interval prediction. Despite its larger number of parameters, the multitask GP is computationally easier to learn than its single task pendant.",

We show that this generating function is rational and obtain explicit closed forms, depending on the parity of k.

We also obtain explicit formulas for related refined quantities, such as the number of compositions with an even or odd number of such parts, the total number of their occurrences among all compositions of n, and positional statistics describing how late the first such part appears in a composition.

DDs are directed acyclic layered graphs; restricted DDs are a generalized greedy heuristic for finding feasible solutions, and relaxed DDs compute combinatorial relaxed bounds. There is substantial theory that leverages DD-based bounding, yet the complexity of constructing the DDs themselves has received little attention. Standard restricted DD construction requires $O(w \\log(w))$ per layer; standard relaxed DD construction requires $O(w^2)$, where $w$ is the width of the DD. Increasing $w$ improves bound quality at the cost of more time and memory.\n  We introduce implicit Decision Diagrams, storing arcs implicitly rather than explicitly, and reducing per-layer complexity to $O(w)$ for restricted and relaxed DDs. We prove this is optimal: any framework treating state-update and merge operations as black boxes cannot do better.\n  Optimal complexity shifts the challenge from algorithmic overhead to low-level engineering. We show how implicit DDs can drive a MIP solver, and release ImplicitDDs.jl, an open-source Julia solver exploiting the implementation refinements our theory enables.

Motivated by this limitation, we explore the broader class of real trees, which retain low-dimensional interpretability while allowing greater flexibility.\n  To address the embedding problem, we develop two key tools: a combinatorial representation of Robinson spaces and a topological characterization of caterpillars, a restricted class of real trees. These tools enable a formulation of the embedding problem as a linear program, providing both computational and theoretical insights. We prove that some subclasses of Robinson spaces always admit embeddings in a caterpillar, and we establish the existence of Robinson spaces that cannot be embedded in any real tree.

Usually based on polynomial filtering, restarting is crucial to limit memory and the cost of orthogonalization. In this work, we propose a novel strategy for the same purpose, called Lanczos with compression. Unlike polynomial filtering, our approach compresses the Krylov subspace using rational approximation and, in doing so, it sacrifices the structure of the associated Krylov decomposition. Nevertheless, it remains compatible with subsequent Lanczos steps and the overall algorithm is still solely based on matrix-vector products with $A$. On the theoretical side, we show that compression introduces only a small error compared to standard (unrestarted) Lanczos and therefore has only a negligible impact on convergence. Comparable guarantees are not available for commonly used implicit restarting strategies, including the Krylov--Schur method. On the practical side, our numerical experiments demonstrate that compression often outperforms the Krylov--Schur method in terms of matrix-vector products.",

In the classical Hadamard manifold framework, a subgradient provides a global lower model of a convex function expressed through the inverse exponential map. However, this model may fail to exhibit a useful convexity or concavity structure. By contrast, our characterization yields a concave bounding function by exploiting key properties of Busemann functions. We use this concavity to design and analyze difference-of-convex (DC) optimization methods on Hadamard manifolds. In particular, we reformulate the classical DC algorithm (DCA) for Riemannian contexts and study its convergence properties.

This approach provides a software-defined 'self-healing' capability, demonstrating exceptional robustness against random element failures without requiring additional processing steps for DOA estimation.",

In this paper, we remove the hyperbolic constraint, proving that every knot in $S^3$ has only finitely many fibered predecessors under ribbon concordance. The key new input is an inequality relating the knot Floer homology of a generalized satellite knot with that of its companion, proved via the immersed curves formulation of bordered Heegaard Floer homology, which should be of independent interest. Our work, together with results of Kojima--McShane, also leads to an explicit upper bound on the Gromov norm of the complement of any fibered predecessor of a knot $K \\subset S^3$, in terms of the arc index and genus of $K$.",

    "abstract": "We consider decision-making problems that are formulated as non-convex optimization programs where uncertainty enters the constraints through an additive term, independent of the decision variables, and robustness is imposed using a finite data-set, according to the scenario robust optimization paradigm. By exploiting the structure of the constraints, we show that both a priori and a posteriori distribution-free probabilistic robustness certificates for a possibly sub-optimal solution to the resulting data-driven optimization problem can be obtained with minimal computational effort. Building on these results, we also discuss a one-shot and an incremental procedure to determine the size of the data-set so as to guarantee a user-chosen robustness level. Notably, both the a posteriori robustness assessment and incremental data-set sizing do not require to solve the non-convex scenario program. A comparative analysis performed on the unit commitment problem using real data reveals a limited increase in conservativeness with a significant computational saving with respect to the application of scenario theory results for general, non necessarily structured, non-convex problems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a rigorous convergence analysis of the $L^{p+1}$-normalized gradient flow with asymptotic Lagrange multiplier (GFALM) method for computing the action ground state of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the focusing case. First, a general global convergence theory is established for the semi-discrete GFALM scheme, guaranteeing the existence of an accumulation point and a convergent subsequence. Then, under additional non-degeneracy assumptions, a local exponential convergence rate is rigorously proven. This result is further extended to the fully discrete case using a Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization. The analysis is achieved by characterizing the local geometry of the $L^{p+1}$-constrained manifold near the ground state, establishing a quadratic growth property of the energy functional, and deriving a \u0141ojasiewicz-type gradient inequality. Finally, the paper also investigates the exponential convergence of the associated continuous-time gradient flow, providing a theoretical foundation for future numerical discretizations. This work extends existing convergence analyses for energy ground states, addressing the challenges posed by the $L^{p+1}$ constraint, especially the absence of an inner-product structure.",

    "abstract": "In many applications, weighted networks are constructed based on time series data: each time series is associated to a vertex and edge weights are given by pairwise correlations. The result is a network whose edge dependency structure violates the assumptions of most common network models. Nonetheless, it is common to analyze these \"correlation networks\" using embedding methods derived from edge-independent network models, based on a belief that the edges are approximately independent. In this work, we put this modeling choice on firm theoretical ground. We show that when the time series are expressible in terms of a small number of Fourier basis elements (or in some other suitably-chosen basis), correlation networks correspond to latent space networks with dependent edge noise in which the vertex-level latent variables encode the basis coefficients. Further, we show that when time series are observed subject to noise, spectral embedding of the resulting noisy correlation network still recovers these true vertex-level latent representations under suitable assumptions. This characterization of embeddings as learning Fourier coefficients appears to be folklore in the signal processing community in the context of principal component analysis, but is, to the best of our knowledge, new to the statistical network analysis literature.",

In particular, we study the Fourier projection corresponding to the proposed orthonormal scaling basis, and introduce a discrete version of it by approximating the Fourier--like coefficients. For both continuous and discrete orthogonal projections, we prove the uniform boundedness of the Lebesgue constants and the uniform convergence with an asymptotic rate comparable with the best uniform polynomial approximation.\n  Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and compare the new orthonormal VP scaling and wavelet bases with the interpolating case previously treated by the authors.",

This paper presents a topology aware (TA) framework to leverage the topological structure in SAGIN to address the multi-functional communication challenge, particularly the integrated sensing, communication, and power transfer (ISCPT) problem. To take advantage of the topological structure, we initially establish the topology according to the criteria of visibility and channel strength.

Our numerical results show a clear dichotomy linked with the tail behaviour of the noise. When considering standard $\u03b1$-stable processes, very large jumps survive the interaction with the spatial complexity and yield anomalous, super-diffusive transport.

As a main result we also prove a quantum version of the Gross-Tucker theorem which characterizes precisely which graphs can be written as derived graphs of voltage graphs.",

Our approach towards this first step is more direct, treats the even and odd cases on an equal footing, and has the advantage that the construction of the spectral localiser becomes immediately apparent from the computation of the index pairing via a Kasparov product. In a second step of \"spectral truncation\", we then describe how this spectral flow expression can be computed in terms of the signature of the \"finite volume\" spectral localiser. Throughout, we do not require invertibility of the operator representing the K-homology class, and the even index pairing then obtains an additional contribution coming from the Fredholm index.",

We then extend this minimal model to the so-called Brunella-Miari vector fields ${X} \\subset {X}^{[1]}$, incorporating all monomials associated with points lying on the edges of the Newton diagram. As a second extension, we consider vector fields ${X}^{[1]} \\subset {X}^{[2]}$ that include higher-order terms corresponding to points located above the polygonal line in the Newton diagram. The key point of our approach is to preserve the desingularization geometry at each extension step. We provide explicit desingularization procedures, which enable the computation of the linear part of the return map $\u03a0$ in cases where the desingularized singularity is associated with a hyperbolic polycycle. Several nontrivial examples are included to illustrate the method.",

    "abstract": "A numerical study of tetrahedral Raviart-Thomas mixed finite element methods is presented in the solution of model second order boundary value problems posed in a curved spatial domain. An emphasis is given to the case where normal fluxes are prescribed on a boundary portion. In this case the question on the best way to enforce known boundary degrees of freedom is raised. It seems intuitive that the normal component of the flux variable should preferably not take up corresponding prescribed values at nodes shifted to the boundary of the approximating polyhedron in the underlying normal direction. This is because an accuracy downgrade is to be expected, as shown in https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1045442 and https://doi.org/10.1051/m2an/2025028. In the former work accuracy improvement is achieved by means of a standard Galerkin formulation with parametric elements. The latter one in turn advocates the use of straight-edged triangles combined with a Petrov-Galerkin formulation, in which the aforementioned shift applies only to the test-flux space, while the shape-flux space consists of fields whose fluxes satisfy the prescribed conditions on the true boundary. The first purpose of this article is to show that the method studied in https://doi.org/10.1051/m2an/2025028 for two-dimensional problems can be extended quite naturally to the three-dimensional case. More particularly we illustrate this by carrying out numerical experimentation with such a version for the two lowest order methods of this family, as compared to the corresponding do-nothing strategy. In the case of the lowest order method this comparative study is enriched by assessing as well the performance of its Hermite analog introduced in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cam.2012.08.027.",

    "abstract": "Pinching-antenna systems have recently emerged as a promising solution for enhancing coverage in high-frequency wireless communications by guiding signals through dielectric waveguides and radiating them via position-adjustable antennas. However, their practical deployment is fundamentally constrained by waveguide attenuation and line-installation requirements, which limit the achievable coverage range. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a wireless-fed pinching-antenna architecture that employs highly directional horn antennas to enable efficient coverage extension. Specifically, a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay equipped with horn antennas is introduced between the base station and the waveguide input, which significantly improves the link budget in high-frequency bands while effectively eliminating self-interference. On this basis, we formulate a total power minimization problem subject to a quality-of-service constraint at the user equipment, involving the joint optimization of the pinching-antenna position, the relay amplification gain, and the base station transmit power. By exploiting the structure of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, the optimal pinching-antenna position is first obtained in closed form by balancing waveguide attenuation and free-space path loss. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the optimal relay gain and transmit power are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms conventional systems without relaying and relay-assisted transmission with fixed antennas in terms of total power consumption.",

A complex baseband signal model is formulated to capture free-space path loss, waveguide attenuation, and distance-dependent phase rotation between the user and each pinching antenna. Using this model, we derive the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to the user location and obtain closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the position error bound (PEB). A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that jointly considers the received signal amplitude and phase is developed to estimate the unknown user location. Given the non-convexity of the estimation problem, a two-stage solution combining coarse grid search and Levenberg-Marquardt refinement is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed phase-aware estimator outperforms existing amplitude-only method in terms of positioning accuracy.",

We show that degree $k$ $t$-Hermitian forms uniquely correspond to order $2k+1$ Hermitian tensors arising as canonical representatives within the $^*$-algebra of Hermitian tensors equipped with the $t$-product/$t$-Einstein product. Applying the discrete Fourier transform, their corresponding $t$-Hermitian forms decompose into collections of classical degree $k$ Hermitian forms. This decomposition yields a universal lifting property, allowing arbitrary collections of degree $k$ Hermitian forms to be viewed as a single structured object which preserves fundamental properties such as Hermitian positive-definiteness.\n  For a distinguished class of $t$-Hermitian forms, which we refer to as commutant $t$-Hermitian forms, we establish a spectral theory extending the classical spectral characterization of Hermitian tensors. In particular, we relate Hermitian positive-definiteness to two distinct classes of eigenvalues: the tensor eigenvalues of each frontal slice of the form's corresponding tensor, and matrix eigenvalues obtained after unfolding each of these slices into matrices. Indeed, we prove that the tensor eigenvalues characterize Hermitian positive-definiteness; moreover, positivity of the matrix eigenvalues implies Hermitian positive-definiteness, however the converse fails in general.\n  Together, these results provide a unified framework for structured interactions among higher-degree Hermitian forms and lay the groundwork for further study, especially with regards to the consequences of the spectral hierarchy of positivity inherent in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Consider a $n\\times n$ sparse non-Hermitian random matrix $X_n$ defined as the Hadamard product between a random matrix with centered independent and identically distributed entries and a sparse Bernoulli matrix with success probability $K_n/n$ where $K_n\\le n$ (and possibly $K_n\\ll n$) and $K_n\\to \\infty$ as $n\\to \\infty$. Let $E_n$ be a deterministic $n\\times n$ finite-rank matrix. We prove that the outlier eigenvalues of $Y_n= X_n +E_n$ asymptotically match those of $E_n$. In the special case of a rank-one deformation, assuming further that the sparsity parameter satisfies $K_n \\gg \\log^9(n)$ and that the entries of the random matrix are sub-Gaussian, we describe the limiting behavior of the projection of the right eigenvector associated with the leading eigenvalue onto the right eigenvector of the rank-one deformation. In particular, we prove that the projection behaves as in the Hermitian case. To that end, we rely on the recent universality results of Brailovskaya and van Handel (2024) relating the singular value spectra of deformations of $X_n$ to Gaussian analogues of these matrices. Our analysis builds upon a recent framework introduced by Bordenave et.al. (2022), and amounts to showing the asymptotic equivalence between the reverse characteristic polynomial of the random matrix and a random analytic function on the unit disc with explicit dependence on the finite-rank deformation.",

Parabolic Hecke algebras are idempotent subalgebras of Hecke algebras corresponding to parabolic subgroups, and for type A they coincide with the fused Hecke algebras appearing in a generalisation of the Schur-Weyl duality with the quantum group of GL(N). In this paper we investigate two different Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for parabolic Hecke algebras, together with the associated cells and the corresponding representations. We quickly specialise to type A, for which we describe the cells in terms of the RSK correspondence generalising thus the well-known description for the symmetric group. As a first application we recover the classification of irreducible representations of parabolic Hecke algebras of type A and provide a new construction of these representations. Next we turn to the Schur-Weyl duality and describe the kernel in terms of one the basis studied precedently. Moreover, we formulate some conjectures about a generator of these kernels in terms of Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements, give some evidence and prove these conjectures in some special cases.",

A key idea is that mapping cones of continuation maps detect crossings with the discriminant (recall that Givental's index is a continuous integer valued function on the complement of the discriminant). To properly handle the inherent non-canonicity in defining such mapping cones, we lift the structure of contact Floer cohomology to chain level by defining it as an $\\infty$-functor on a suitable $\\infty$-categorification of the Eliashberg-Polterovich orderability relation on the universal cover of the contactomorphism group.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces delay-alignment modulation (DAM) for secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Due to the broadcast nature of multi-user downlinks, communications are vulnerable to eavesdropping. DAM applies controlled per-path symbol delays at the transmitter to coherently align the multipath components at the intended user, enhancing the received signal power, while simultaneously creating delay misalignment at the eavesdropper (Eve). To mitigate sensing degradation caused by multipath propagation, we propose a two-stage protocol that first estimates the angle and then the delay of the line-of-sight (LoS) path after suppressing multipath interference. We derive the secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE) and the Cramer-Rao (CRB) of the target delay. Finally, we develop a path-based zero-forcing (ZF) precoding framework and formulate a max-min SSE design under CRB and power constraints. Simulation results show DAM significantly outperforms the strongest-path (SP) benchmark in terms of SSE, while meeting sensing requirements, since intentional delay alignment at legitimate users degrades reception at Eve.",

In this paper we investigate goodness-of-fit and two-sample testing procedures for statistical networks based on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt). Our approach formulates a constrained entropy-maximization problem on the space of networks, subject to prescribed structural constraints. The resulting test statistics are defined through the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constrained optimization problem, which, to our knowledge, is novel in the statistical networks literature.\n  We establish consistency in the classical regime where the number of vertices is fixed. We then consider asymptotic regimes in which the graph size grows with the sample size, developing tests for both dense and sparse settings. In the dense case, we analyze exponential random graph models (ERGM) (including the Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e8nyi models), while in the sparse regime our theory applies to Erd{\u00f6}s-R{\u00e8}nyi graphs.\n  Our analysis leverages recent advances in nonlinear large deviation theory for random graphs. We further show that the proposed Lagrange-multiplier framework connects naturally to classical score tests for constrained maximum likelihood estimation.

To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-functional coordination framework that enables seamless cooperation within the LAWN while supporting efficient execution of diverse network functions. In the proposed architecture, each device or infrastructure element is assigned to a specific functional role, namely, edge mobile terminal (E-MT), distributed MT (D-MT), or computing center. E-MTs are equipped with lightweight, independent signal processing and computing capabilities, while D-MTs and the computing center handle regional and global coordination, respectively. To enhance the overall network efficiency, we model the LAWN as a sparse graph, where nodes represent network nodes and edges are defined according to a set of controllable connection rules. This topology-aware (TA) representation allows for efficiently solving various coordination tasks across the network. Numerical results show that the proposed TA coordination framework outperforms baseline approaches that lack topological insights, achieving higher efficiency in multi-task coordination.

For the dense subset of rational initial data, we establish quasi-periodicity in time and a-priori bounds on $\\| \\mathbf{u}(t) \\|_{H^s(\\mathbb{T})}$ for any $s >0$.\n  Our analysis relies crucially on an explicit formula arising from the Lax pair structure acting on a Hardy space of vector-valued holomorphic functions on the unit disk. As a central ingredient, we develop a general {\\em stability principle} for explicit formulae associated with completely integrable PDEs possessing a Lax pair structure on Hardy spaces, including the Benjamin--Ono equation, Calogero--Sutherland DNLS, and the half-wave-maps equation posed on $\\mathbb{T}$.\n  Our results extend to the matrix-valued half-wave maps equation $$ \\partial_t \\mathbf{U} = -\\frac{i}{2} [ \\mathbf{U}, |D| \\mathbf{U} ] $$ with target manifold given by the complex Grassmannians $\\mathsf{Gr}_k(\\mathbb{C}^d)$, thereby generalizing the special case $\\mathbb{S}^2 \\cong \\mathbb{CP}^1 \\cong \\mathsf{Gr}_1(\\mathbb{C}^2)$. In a companion work, we prove global well-posedness for the half-wave maps equation posed on $\\mathbb{R}$ in the scaling-critical energy space $\\dot{H}^{1/2}$, by establishing a stability principle for explicit formulae on Hardy spaces in the complex half-plane $\\mathbb{C}_+$.",

    "abstract": "A classical theorem of Wendroff shows that one may reconstructs a sequence of orthogonal polynomials on the real line from two non-constant polynomials of consecutive degrees whose zeros strictly interlace on the real line. In this note we extend this result to arbitrary non-constant polynomials. The reconstruction may be formulated via a Vandermonde-type linear system and recast as an underdetermined inverse spectral problem, in which the spectra of a finite Jacobi matrix and of one of its leading principal submatrices are prescribed. In addition, the analogous result on the unit circle is established by reconstructing a sequence of paraorthogonal polynomials from two arbitrary non-constant polynomials whose zeros strictly interlace on the unit circle. In this setting, the Jacobi matrix is replaced by a finite unitary pentadiagonal matrix, and the spectral data consist of the spectrum of the full matrix together with that of a rank-one perturbation of a leading principal submatrix. Strict interlacing of zeros is shown to be a necessary and sufficient condition for solvability, and explicit constructions of the associated polynomial families and matrices are provided. Finally, an algorithm and several illustrative examples are presented.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new method for online parameter estimation in stochastic interacting particle systems, based on continuous observation of a small number of particles from the system. Our method recursively updates the model parameters using a stochastic approximation of the gradient of the asymptotic log likelihood, which is computed using the continuous stream of observations. Under suitable assumptions, we rigorously establish convergence of our method to the stationary points of the asymptotic log-likelihood of the interacting particle system. We consider asymptotics both in the limit as the time horizon $t\\rightarrow\\infty$, for a fixed and finite number of particles, and in the joint limit as the number of particles $N\\rightarrow\\infty$ and the time horizon $t\\rightarrow\\infty$. Under additional assumptions on the asymptotic log-likelihood, we also establish an $\\mathrm{L}^2$ convergence rate and a central limit theorem. Finally, we present several numerical examples of practical interest, including a model for systemic risk, a model of interacting FitzHugh--Nagumo neurons, and a Cucker--Smale flocking model. Our numerical results corroborate our theoretical results, and also suggest that our estimator is effective even in cases where the assumptions required for our theoretical analysis do not hold.",

We define and study a broad generalization of such wavefunctions that can be associated to any lattice. We obtain these wavefunctions as the Laplace transform of a polyhedral fan, the universe fan, whose cones are defined by positivity conditions reflecting a notion of causality in the lattice, and we describe its face lattice. In the matroid case, the universe fan projects to the nested set fan, and the wavefunctions we define recover the matroid amplitudes introduced by Lam as residues. Moreover, in the case relevant for physics, the positivity conditions give a novel way to study the wavefunction, and we show how it is related to the cosmological polytopes of Arkani-Hamed, Benincasa, Postnikov. Finally, we study refinements of the universe fan induced by piecewise linear (tropical) functions. The resulting subdivisions project to refinements of the nested set fan and correspond dually to blow-ups of matroid polytopes, generalizing the cosmohedron polytope.",

    "abstract": "We study the degree-weighted work required to compute $\\ell_1$-regularized PageRank using the standard one-gradient-per-iteration accelerated proximal-gradient method (FISTA). For non-accelerated local methods, the best known worst-case work scales as $\\widetilde{O} ((\u03b1\u03c1)^{-1})$, where $\u03b1$ is the teleportation parameter and $\u03c1$ is the $\\ell_1$-regularization parameter. A natural question is whether FISTA can improve the dependence on $\u03b1$ from $1/\u03b1$ to $1/\\sqrt\u03b1$ while preserving the $1/\u03c1$ locality scaling. The challenge is that acceleration can break locality by transiently activating nodes that are zero at optimality, thereby increasing the cost of gradient evaluations. We analyze FISTA on a slightly over-regularized objective and show that, under a checkable confinement condition, all spurious activations remain inside a boundary set $\\mathcal{B}$. This yields a bound consisting of an accelerated $(\u03c1\\sqrt\u03b1)^{-1}\\log(\u03b1/\\varepsilon)$ term plus a boundary overhead $\\sqrt{vol(\\mathcal{B})}/(\u03c1\u03b1^{3/2})$. We provide graph-structural conditions that imply such confinement. Experiments on synthetic and real graphs show the resulting speedup and slowdown regimes under the degree-weighted work model.",
