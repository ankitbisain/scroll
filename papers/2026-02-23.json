    "title": "Interactions that reshape the interfaces of the interacting parties",
    "abstract": "Polynomial functors model systems with interfaces: each polynomial specifies the outputs a system can produce and, for each output, the inputs it accepts. The bicategory $\\mathbb{O}\\mathbf{rg}$ of dynamic organizations \\cite{spivak2021learners} gives a notion of state-driven interaction patterns that evolves over time, but each system's interface remains fixed throughout the interaction. Yet in many systems, the outputs sent and inputs received can reshape the interface itself: a cell differentiating in response to chemical signals gains or loses receptors; a sensor damaged by its input loses a channel; a neural network may grow its output resolution during training.\n  Here we introduce *polynomial trees*, elements of the terminal $(u\\triangleleft u)$-coalgebra where $u$ is the polynomial associated to a universe of sets, to model such systems: a polynomial tree is a coinductive tree whose nodes carry polynomials, and in which each round of interaction -- an output chosen and an input received -- determines a child tree, hence the next interface. We construct a monoidal closed category $\\mathbf{PolyTr}$ of polynomial trees, with coinductively-defined morphisms, tensor product, and internal hom. We then build a bicategory $\\mathbb{O}\\mathbf{rgTr}$ generalizing $\\mathbb{O}\\mathbf{rg}$, whose hom-categories parametrize morphisms by state sets with coinductive action-and-update data. We provide a locally fully faithful functor $\\mathbb{O}\\mathbf{rg}\\to\\mathbb{O}\\mathbf{rgTr}$ via constant trees, those for which the interfaces do not change through time. We illustrate the generalization by suggesting a notion of progressive generative adversarial networks, where gradient feedback determines when the image-generation interface grows to a higher resolution.",

    "abstract": "The global clustering coefficient serves as a powerful metric for the structural analysis and comparison of complex networks. Random geometric graphs offer a realistic framework for representing the spatial constraints and geometry often found in real-world network datasets. In this paper, we establish a central limit theorem for the global clustering coefficient of random geometric graphs. Our main result identifies the centering and scaling sequences required for convergence in law to the standard normal distribution. Our approach varies by regime: in the dense case, we employ the Lyapunov CLT; in the intermediate case, we utilize the asymptotic theory of $U$-statistics with sample-size-dependent kernels; and in the sparse regime, we use the method of moments to derive the asymptotic distribution. Notably, the convergence rates for non-uniform and uniform random geometric graphs diverge in the dense regime, yet they coincide in the sparse regime. In addition, we find that the global clustering coefficient for both uniform and non-uniform RGGs is asymptotically equal to $3/4$",

Gromov's filling area conjecture in differential geometry from 1983 asserts that among all compact, orientable Riemannian surfaces which isometrically fill the Riemannian circle, the one with the smallest surface area is the hemisphere. Gromov demonstrated that this is indeed the case if $M$ is homeomorphic to the disk. While Gromov's conjecture has since been verified in some other cases, the full conjecture remains unresolved.\n  In this paper, we consider a discrete analogue of Gromov's problem, which is likely natural to those who study graph embeddings on arbitrary surfaces. Using standard graph-theoretic tools, such as Menger's theorem, we obtain reasonable asymptotic bounds on this discrete variant. We then demonstrate how these discrete bounds can be translated to the continuous setting, showing that any isometric filling of the Riemannian circle of length $2\u03c0$ has surface area at least $1.36\u03c0$ (the hemisphere has surface area $2\u03c0$). This appears to be the first quantitative lower-bound on Gromov's problem that applies to arbitrary isometric fillings.",

    "abstract": "Bi-conjugate gradient (Bi-CG) and bi-conjugate residual (Bi-CR) methods are underlying iterative solvers for linear systems with nonsymmetric matrices. Residual smoothing is a standard technique for obtaining smooth convergence behavior of residual norms; additionally, it represents the transformation between iterative methods. For example, the residuals of the CR method can be obtained by applying a smoothing scheme to those of the CG method for symmetric linear systems. Based on this relationship, the transformation from Bi-CG residuals to Bi-CR residuals using a smoothing scheme was examined in our previous study [Kawase, A., Aihara, K.: Transformation from Bi-CG into Bi-CR Using a Residual Smoothing-like Scheme. AIP Conference Proceedings (2026)]; however, we only provided heuristic and experimental observations. In the present study, we provide a detailed discussion on the theoretical aspects of these transformations. Specifically, we prove that the resulting algorithm transformed from the Bi-CG method using the residual smoothing technique has the same bi-orthogonal properties as those of the original Bi-CR method. We also present a more concise transformation algorithm and its numerical example. These analyses complement our previous study and provide theoretical validity of the residual transformation between the Bi-CG and Bi-CR methods.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a class of states of a composite quantum system, the so-called cross states, that turn out to play a major role in the theory of entanglement for a genuinely infinite-dimensional bipartite system. In the case where at least one of the Hilbert spaces of the bipartition is finite-dimensional, all states are cross states, whereas, in the genuinely infinite-dimensional setting where the dimension of both Hilbert spaces is not finite, the cross states form a trace-norm dense, convex, proper subset of the set of all states. In the latter case, the cross states can be regarded as those physical states that possess a finite amount of entanglement; accordingly, all separable states are of this kind. We prove that, for any Hilbert space dimension, the separable states can be characterized as those cross states that minimize a suitable norm, i.e., the projective norm associated with the projective tensor product of two trace classes; all other cross states are density operators belonging to the projective tensor product space. This is a generalization of the classical cross norm criterion of separability. Finally, we define an extended real-valued entanglement function and study its main properties. Coherently with the interpretation of cross states as finitely entangled states, this function is finite, and coincides with the projective norm, precisely on the cross states of the system.",

For a special choice of the parameter, this system was recently identified in the study of multiplicative statistics of the Bessel point process.

While exploiting a block triangular submatrix has limited fill-in, unsymmetric matrix factorization methods do not reveal inertia, which is required by interior point methods for nonconvex optimization. We show that our target matrix has inertia that is known \\textit{a priori}, letting us compute inertia of the KKT matrix by Sylvester's law. Finally, we demonstrate the computational advantage of this method on KKT systems from optimization problems with neural network surrogates in their constraints. Our method achieves up to 15$\\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art symmetric indefinite matrix factorization methods MA57 and MA86 in a constant-hardware comparison.",

We discuss several classes of non-separable examples satisfying our assumptions, including conditionally mean-zero distributions, the random features model $\\g = \u03c3(X\\w)$ arising in machine learning, and Gaussian measures with nonlinear tilting.

Firstly, we rigorously prove existence result of the ground state and derive some analytical properties, including the virial identity and negativity of SOC energy. Secondly, we propose an efficient and accurate preconditioned nonlinear conjugate gradient (PCG) algorithm to compute the ground states. We truncate the whole space into a bounded rectangular domain and readily apply the Fourier spectral method to approximate the wave function. The PCG method is successfully adapted with appropriate modifications to the adaptive step size control strategy for the one-parameter energy minimization problem and to the choice of preconditioners, achieving great performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Lastly, we carry out extensive numerical experiments to verify the existence and property results of the ground states, confirm the spatial spectral accuracy by traversing the most commonly-used initial guesses for each component thanks to its great efficiency, which is also attributed to a utilization of cascadic multigrid and discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Moreover, we investigate the effects of local interaction, rotation and spin-orbit coupling and external trapping potential on the ground state, and unveil some interesting physical phenomena, such as giant vortex and U-shape vortex line.",

We employ high-order summation-by-parts finite-difference operators in conjunction with simultaneous-approximation-terms (SATs) in curvilinear coordinates for spatial derivatives, combined with first- and second-order time discretizations and temporal extrapolation at the interface. Energy stability is maintained by carefully selecting SAT parameters at the interface. A range of coupling parameters are explored to identify those that yield a stable scheme, and a stepwise approach for choosing SAT parameters that ensure stability is given. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through numerical experiments in a two-dimensional model problem on a rectangular domain with curvilinear grids. The proposed approach enables the development of high-order, conditionally stable partitioned solvers suitable for general geometries.",

    "abstract": "The golden sieve, a self-referential deletion process on increasing sequences of positive integers, was introduced by the author in 2002 (OEIS A099267). At each step, a pointer read from the working sequence designates which element to remove. Applied to the natural numbers, the sieve is governed by the golden ratio and recovers the Wythoff partition. We develop the theory of the golden sieve on arithmetic progressions and reveal new structural properties. The survivor sequence is a hiccup sequence in the sense of Fokkink and Joshi, whose gaps take exactly two consecutive values, selected by a rule that depends on the sequence itself. The resulting partition satisfies a Fraenkel-type complementary equation, and the gap word is Sturmian in the base case. A double sieve variant, where both pointer and target are removed at each step, yields three-way partitions of the integers. On perfect squares, the hiccup rule becomes doubly self-referential: the gap at step $n$ is controlled by whether $n$ is the square of a survivor index, so the sequence governs its own gaps through its squared values. A bootstrap argument yields the precise asymptotic growth of the survivors. We also introduce the extraction sieve $\\mathcal{C}_{j,y,z}$, a family of processes that repeatedly extract and delete elements from the bottom of an infinite sequence. On $\\mathbb{N}$, this sieve produces the $(j,1,y,z)$-hiccup sequence of Fokkink--Joshi, tautologically. Thus the ``silver sieve'' $\\mathcal{C}_{1,3,2}$ on $\\mathbb{N}$ is simply the Bosma--Dekking--Steiner $(1,1,3,2)$-hiccup with slope $1+\\sqrt{2}$. On arithmetic progressions $a\\mathbb{N}+b$, the sieve produces the new $(j,\\,a{+}b,\\,ay,\\,az)$-hiccup via an affine action on parameter space, providing an algebraic bridge between sieves and hiccup sequences.",

    "abstract": "The basic power function $t_n(x)=x^n$ is in some sense a classical limit for large $x$, of the monictised Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind $T_n(x)/2^{n-1}$. A theorem of Ritt says they are the only two families of polynomials $p_n(x)$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ which satisfies the commutativity relation $p_n(p_m(x))=p_m(p_n(x))$. The commutativity $t_n(t_m(x))=t_m(t_n(x))$ is the reason why the RSA scheme allow also digital signature but the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol depends only on the commutativity. The DH scheme and many results in elementary local (at a fixed prime) multiplicative number theory is about properties of the power function $t_n(x)$ and they have natural analogue extension to $T_n(x)$. Recently we discovered a Chebyshev version of Euler's primality criterion , which however depends on two quadratic characters $\u03b5_p(a)=\\left ( \\frac{a^2-1}{p} \\right)$ and $\u03b4_p(a)=\\left( \\frac{2(a+1)}{p} \\right)$. This gives rise to a local partition of the integers mod an odd prime $p$ in two distinct ways into 4 disjoint sets $A_{\u03b5\u03b4}$ of smaller size about $p/4$ over which the exponential sum still have squar root cancellations. This can be thought of as a real refinement of the residue/non-residue as it arise from viewing $T_n(x)$ is the \"real\" part of the $n$th power of the unit $\u03c9_x=x+\\sqrt{x^2-1}$, namely $\u03c9_x^n=T_n(x)+U_{n-1}(x)\\sqrt{x^2-1}$. There are obvious analogue of Chebyshev version of pseudoprimes, Wieferich primes, Lucas-Lehmer, AKS, Diffie-Hellman, cyclotomic expansions and probably many others which hopefully some may give improved resuts on the original version.",

    "abstract": "Flexible coupler is a promising solution for enhancing wireless network capacity by moving passive couplers around a fixed-position active antenna to reshape the induced currents on passive elements. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel flexible coupler array that incorporates additional degrees of freedom (DoF) in radiation pattern reconfiguration and enhanced communication coverage with low hardware cost. Specifically, a new form of mechanical beamforming can be obtained by moving only the passive coupling elements while keeping the active antenna stationary. In addition, the flexible coupler antenna can slide along a rail toward users, thereby enhancing communication coverage. To fully exploit the potential of the flexible coupler array, we formulate a two-timescale sum-rate maximization problem with statistical channel state information (CSI). The antenna position is optimized based on scattering cluster-core statistics in the slow timescale, while mechanical beamforming is optimized based on multipath channel statistics in the fast timescale, subject to movement and energy constraints. To address the coupling between timescales and the high cost of extensive channel sampling, we develop a digital agent framework that leverages an electromagnetic (EM) map to generate statistical channel information for different user and antenna positions. Then, a deep neural network is trained to learn a slow-fast performance (SFP) surrogate. Mechanical beamforming at the fast timescale is obtained by selecting per-antenna radiation patterns from a predefined dictionary via a convex relaxation. Simulation results verify the performance gains achieved by the proposed flexible coupler array and the digital-agent-assisted algorithm.",

Our analysis yields smaller relative forward error bounds for the computed singular values than those of standard SVD algorithms. We present and analyse two approaches for constructing effective preconditioners. Our numerical experiments support the theoretical results and demonstrate that our algorithm achieves smaller relative forward errors than the LAPACK routines $\\texttt{DGESVJ}$ and $\\texttt{DGEJSV}$, as well as the MATLAB function $\\texttt{svd}$, particularly for ill-conditioned matrices. Timing tests show that our approach accelerates the convergence of the Jacobi iterations and that the dominant cost arises from a single high-precision matrix-matrix multiplication. With improved software or hardware support for this bottleneck, our algorithm would be faster than the LAPACK one-sided Jacobi algorithm $\\texttt{DGESVJ}$ and comparable in speed to the state-of-the-art preconditioned one-sided Jacobi algorithm $\\texttt{DGEJSV}$, but much more accurate.",

    "abstract": "A {\\it stuck knot} is a knot diagram containing designated crossings, called {\\it stuck crossings}, whose incident strands are required to remain locally non-separable. These rigidity constraints restrict the allowable ambient isotopies and introduce new geometric features into the study of knot embeddings. In this paper we develop a topological framework for knots governed by such constraints. We model stuck crossings as locally rigid configurations in spatial embeddings, placing stuck knots in close relation to rigid spatial graph theory while preserving the classical over-under information and orientation of crossings. We formalize the corresponding notion of isotopy and introduce the {\\it unstick move}, which releases rigidity and allows classical simplifications to occur. To detect rigid structure algebraically, we construct polynomial invariants for stuck knots, including a HOMFLYPT-type invariant and a state-sum model extending the Kauffman bracket. These invariants show that rigidity contributes independent information even when the underlying classical knot type remains fixed. We further introduce a {\\it relaxed isotopy} framework and define the {\\it unsticking distance}, a geometric measure quantifying the minimal number of rigidity constraints that must be released in order to relate two stuck knots. This perspective interprets stuck crossings as barriers to isotopy and highlights the role of constraint release in diagrammatic simplification.",

    "abstract": "By work of Davison and Meinhardt, the cohomological Hall algebra of a symmetric quiver with potential admits a geometrically defined filtration (the perverse filtration) whose associated graded is a supercommutative algebra. In the case of the triple quiver of a quiver with the canonical cubic potential, which corresponds to the preprojective algebra of the quiver via dimensional reduction, there is an additional filtration (the less perverse filtration), which is defined more generally for cohomological Hall algebras of suitably geometric 2-Calabi-Yau categories in work of Davison. In this paper, we show that the degenerations of the cohomological Hall algebras of preprojective algebras and more generally 2-Calabi-Yau categories with respect to the less perverse filtration is isomorphic to the enveloping algebra of the current Lie algebra of the BPS Lie algebra. This result applies in particular to CoHAs of local systems on Riemann surfaces and Higgs bundles on smooth projective curves. We extend this description to deformations of the cohomological Hall algebra obtained via torus actions on the arrows of the quiver and deformed canonical cubic potentials via the deformed dimensional reduction of Davison-P\u0103durariu. Last, we use our results to compare the less perverse filtration on CoHAs of preprojective algebras with the order filtration on the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, via the comparison isomorphism of Botta-Davison and Schiffmann-Vasserot.",

It has been shown that critical points of the energy functional in this framework correspond to non-degenerate eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian if and only if the partition is bipartite. In this work we generalize this result to partitions that are not necessarily bipartite by constructing a modified graph Laplacian called the partition Laplacian. The main result states that critical points of the spectral energy functional correspond to nodal partitions of non-degenerate eigenvectors of the partition Laplacian. Furthermore, the stability of each critical point is determined entirely by the nodal deficiency of the associated eigenvector. We also consider more general signed Laplacians and prove that Courant-sharp Laplacian eigenvectors induce globally minimal partitions.",

This blurs operator structure, thereby confounding solution approximation error with governing-equation enforcement error and making the solving and learning progress hard to interpret and control. Here we introduce the Neural Basis Method, a projection-based formulation that couples a predefined, physics-conforming neural basis space with an operator-induced residual metric to obtain a well-conditioned deterministic minimization. Stability and reliability then hinge on this metric: the residual is not merely an optimization objective but a computable certificate tied to approximation and enforcement, remaining stable under basis enrichment and yielding reduced coordinates that are learnable across parametric instances. We use advective multiscale Darcian dynamics as a concrete demonstration of this broader point. Our method produce accurate and robust solutions in single solves and enable fast and effective parametric inference with operator learning.",

    "abstract": "Malicious jamming presents a pervasive threat to the secure communications, where the challenge becomes increasingly severe due to the growing capability of the jammer allowing the adaptation to legitimate transmissions. This paper investigates the jamming mitigation by leveraging an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS), where the channel uncertainties are particularly addressed for robust anti-jamming design. Towards this issue, we adopt the Stackelberg game formulation to model the strategic interaction between the legitimate side and the adversary, acting as the leader and follower, respectively. We prove the existence of the game equilibrium and adopt the backward induction method for equilibrium analysis. We first derive the optimal jamming policy as the follower's best response, which is then incorporated into the legitimate-side optimization for robust anti-jamming design. We address the uncertainty issue and reformulate the legitimate-side problem by exploiting the error bounds to combat the worst-case jamming attacks. The problem is decomposed within a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) framework to tackle the power allocation, transceiving beamforming, and active reflection, respectively, which are iterated towards the robust jamming mitigation scheme. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in protecting the legitimate transmissions under uncertainties, and the superior performance in terms of jamming mitigation as compared with the baselines.",

    "abstract": "In this study $n$-body systems on the plane, invariant under the dihedral group $D_n$, with quadratic pairwise interactions are considered. In the center-of-mass frame the dynamics separates into Fourier normal modes. Although suitable couplings can make the system maximally superintegrable (so all bounded motions are periodic), resonance of the mode frequencies does not by itself ensure choreographic motion. We give an explicit criterion for choreographic symmetry of a $T$-periodic solution: invariance under the choreography generator (time shift $T/n$ combined with cyclic relabeling/rotation) holds if and only if every dynamically active Fourier sector satisfies a sectorwise phase condition. This yields a direct test for when a closed orbit can be realized as a single-trace $n$-body choreography. When several symmetry-distinct mode families are simultaneously excited, periodic motions are generically not single-trace; for generic superintegrable initial data the particles lie on distinct closed curves, producing multi-trace motion. In special cases this multi-trace structure organizes into sub-choreographies supported on distinct traces; we refer to this structured splitting as choreographic fragmentation. The cases $n=4,5,6$ are analyzed explicitly. In particular, for $n=6$ the maximally superintegrable resonance $1{:}2{:}3$ yields periodic but generically multi-trace dynamics, whereas a single-trace six-body choreography occurs only at the degenerate resonance $1{:}2{:}2$.",

    "abstract": "A signed graph $(G,\u03c3)$ consists of a graph $G$ and the signature $\u03c3: E(G) \\rightarrow \\{+1,-1\\}$. An incidence of $G$ is a pair $(v,e)$, where $v$ is one of the end vertices of an edge $e \\in E(G)$. A proper $q$-edge coloring $\u03b3$ of signed graph $(G,\u03c3)$ is an assignment of colors to incidences satisfying that $\u03b3(v,e) = - \u03c3(e) \u03b3(w,e)$ for every edge $e=vw$ and for any two incidences $(v,e)$ and $(v,f)$, involving the same vertex, $\u03b3(v,e) \\neq \u03b3(v,f)$. The chromatic index of a signed graph $(G,\u03c3)$, denoted by $\u03c7'(G,\u03c3)$, is the minimum number $q$ for which $(G,\u03c3)$ has a proper $q$-edge coloring. In this paper, we determine the chromatic index of signed generalized book graphs. We also determine the chromatic index of signed complete graphs of order up to six.",

    "title": "Hybrid ABBA-GMRES for Unmatched Backprojectors in Large Scale X-Ray Computerized Tomography",
    "abstract": "In large-scale X-ray computed tomography (CT), matrix-free iterative methods are essential due to the prohibitive cost of explicitly forming the system matrix. In practice, forward projectors and backprojectors are often implemented with different discretizations or accelerations, leading to unmatched projector pairs. This mismatch violates the adjointness assumptions underlying classical least-squares solvers, so the resulting iterations no longer correspond to a true least-squares problem and can exhibit non-symmetric or inconsistent behavior. Prior work has explored Krylov subspace solvers such as AB-GMRES and BA-GMRES to handle unmatched projector pairs, where these methods exhibit semi-convergent regularizing behavior. Under matched conditions, AB-GMRES and BA-GMRES reduce to LSQR and LSMR, respectively. However, in the presence of unmatched projectors, AB- and BA-GMRES have been observed to yield improved reconstruction quality compared to classical least-squares solvers. In this paper, we develop hybrid AB- and BA-GMRES methods that incorporate Tikhonov regularization directly into the Krylov subspace iterations. We also examine the relationship between the proposed methods and hybrid variants of LSQR and LSMR, considering both matched and unmatched backprojectors. We propose automatic strategies for selecting regularization parameters, including approaches based on the L-curve and generalized cross validation (GCV), and analyze their effect on convergence behavior and image quality. Numerical experiments on two-dimensional CT problems using GPU-accelerated projectors demonstrate that the proposed hybrid AB- and BA-GMRES methods mitigate semi-convergence, produce higher-quality reconstructions, and exhibit more stable stopping behavior than their non-hybrid counterparts.",

    "abstract": "In the consideration of steady-state flow of gas in pipeline networks, the exclusion of gravity and nonlinear inertial effects (convective acceleration) leads to a fortuitous simplification in the governing equations to yield a system of nonlinear algebraic equations. Consequently, there are no studies that quantify the effect of gravity and inertial effects on the flow of gas in pipeline networks or delineate regimes of flow conditions wherein the effects are significant or negligible. In addressing this need, we consider the steady-state flow equations in pipeline networks without neglecting the gravitational and inertial terms and in place of a system of algebraic equations (one for each pipe), this approach results in a nonlinear system of first-order ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which are coupled through algebraic equations that appear in the form of boundary conditions on the pressure and balance of mass flows at either end. One of our main contributions in this article is to demonstrate how the Newton-Raphson algorithm can still be used to solve the coupled nonlinear differential-algebraic system by utilizing the appropriate forward sensitivity ODEs to evaluate the Jacobian terms arising in the iterative scheme. We also propose a variable transformation that alleviates the poor scaling of the ODE, and we introduce a two-point collocation scheme as a coarse approximation of the system from which to find initial guesses for the Newton iterations. Simulation studies were conducted for a single pipe as well as a large-scale pipeline network with real data. From these studies, we concluded that while the effect of gravity is important, the inertial effect was negligible in all cases. The proposed methodology is applicable to a wide class of pipeline and thermal-fluid networks beyond natural gas, including liquid pipelines and hydrogen transport.",

After introducing the $3-$Hypotheses Correlations in a previous paper, we add two other, very natural, hypotheses: the fifth is a technical one, simplifying calculations; but the fourth is called 'Parity', since it deals with the parity of natural numbers we play with. In particular, we may build (devoting to this 'our mainstream', here) a single Correlation that satisfies these '5 Axioms', thus a T-S one, that 'entangles two different Correlations' (whence Two-Seasons: T-S) depending on $a$ ($=$ the shift) parity. For $a$ even, our 'Artifact' mimics the H-L Correlation, in fact $a=2k$; but, while H-L Correlation is 'negligible', say, on $a$ odd, our Artifact seems to compare at least in the order of magnitude to H-L Correlation on $a$ even, being linked to another additive problem. Namely, on $a$ even, the Artifact 'counts', say, classic solutions to: $p_1+a=p_2$, in odd primes $p_1,p_2$; while, on $a$ odd, it 'counts' solutions to: $p_1+a=2^j p_2$, again with odd primes $p_1,p_2$ and with $j\\in \\N$ (satisfying the natural arithmetic constraints).

    "abstract": "This document serves as supplementary material for our journal submission, providing detailed mathematical proofs and derivations that support the results presented in the main manuscript. Specifically, under a modeling framework that jointly considers transceiver hardware impairments and imperfect successive interference cancellation (SIC), we systematically derive and prove from an optimality perspective that: when the residual interference coefficient approaches 1 (i.e., SIC becomes severely ineffective), there exists an optimal solution such that the common stream beamformer satisfies $\\bm w_c^\\star=\\bm 0$, and hence the optimal rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) transmission structure degenerates into space division multiple access (SDMA). This conclusion provides a verifiable theoretical justification for the convergence phenomenon observed in simulations, namely that \"the RSMA performance gradually approaches that of SDMA as SIC degrades\", and can also serve as a reference for multiple-access selection and system design in SIC-limited scenarios.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new semi-discrete version of the Carleman estimate-based convexification globally convergent numerical method is developed. It is used for the delivery of the starting point for the training procedure of deep learning. An important feature of the continuous version of the convexification method is that its convergence to the true solution is independent on the availability of a good first guess about this solution. A new concept of the h-strong convexity is introduced, where h is the grid step size in the semi-discrete version of the convexification method. The h -strong convexity allows to obtain an a priori accuracy estimate of the starting point for the training step of the deep learning procedure. This approach is demonstrated for a highly nonlinear problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography. Results of numerical experiments for complicated media structures demonstrate the computational feasibility of this procedure.",

    "abstract": "Transfer learning aims to improve inference in a target domain by leveraging information from related source domains, but its effectiveness critically depends on how cross-domain heterogeneity is modeled and controlled. When the conditional mechanism linking covariates and responses varies across domains, indiscriminate information pooling can lead to negative transfer, degrading performance relative to target-only estimation. We study a multi-source, single-target transfer learning problem under conditional distributional drift and propose a semiparametric domain-varying coefficient model (DVCM), in which domain-relatedness is encoded through an observable domain identifier. This framework generalizes classical varying-coefficient models to structured transfer learning and interpolates between invariant and fully heterogeneous regimes. Building on this model, we develop an adaptive transfer learning estimator that selectively borrows strength from informative source domains while provably safeguarding against negative transfer. Our estimator is computationally efficient and easy to implement; we also show that it is minimax rate-optimal and derive its asymptotic distribution, enabling valid uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing despite data-adaptive pooling and shrinkage. Our results precisely characterize the interplay among domain heterogeneity, the smoothness of the underlying mean function, and the number of source domains and are corroborated by comprehensive numerical experiments and two real-data applications.",

It turns out that the global ground state of this foliated space serves as a substitute for the non-existing $L^2$ ground states on the leaves of the foliation. Restricting the global ground state to a leaf gives a generalized eigenwave that can be plugged into the usual machinery to get the Q-process.",

Extending the prefix-sum description of the ASM polytope, we develop a uniform core--assembly framework: each symmetry class is encoded by a set of core positions and an affine assembly map that reconstructs the full matrix from its core. This reduction transfers polyhedral questions to lower-dimensional core polytopes, which are better suited to the tool set of polyhedral combinatorics, while retaining complete information about the original symmetry class. For the vertical, vertical--horizontal, half-turn, diagonal, diagonal--antidiagonal, and total symmetry classes, we give explicit polynomial-size linear inequality descriptions of the associated polytopes. In these cases, we also determine the dimension and provide facet descriptions. The quarter-turn symmetry class behaves differently: the natural relaxation admits fractional vertices, and we need to extend the system with a structured family of parity-type Chv\u00e1tal--Gomory inequalities to obtain the quarter-turn symmetric ASM polytope. Our framework leads to efficient algorithms for computing minimum-cost ASMs in each symmetry class and provides a direct link between the combinatorics of symmetric ASMs and tools from polyhedral combinatorics and combinatorial optimization.",

Our main objective is to determine appropriate radiation conditions at infinity that ensure existence and uniqueness of solutions to the fractional type Helmholtz equation. Extending classical scattering theory for the Helmholtz equation, we introduce and analyze suitable Sommerfeld type radiation conditions for fractional orders. A central contribution is the explicit computation of the outgoing free space Greens function for the operator $(-\u0394)^s-k^{2s}$, for all $0<s<1$, any dimension and $k>0$, obtained via contour integration and a limiting absorption principle. We show that its asymptotic behavior at infinity coincides with a rescaled version of the classical Helmholtz fundamental solution, thereby justifying the standard Sommerfeld radiation condition for compactly supported sources. In addition, using resolvent estimates and a limiting absorption framework, we establish existence and uniqueness of outgoing solutions for compactly supported data, and for weighted sources. We further derive a convolution representation of the solution in terms of the outgoing fundamental solution. For inhomogeneous media with compactly supported perturbations, we reformulate the problem as a Lippmann Schwinger integral equation of Fredholm type and prove unique solvability away from a discrete set of frequencies. Our analysis provides a rigorous foundation for scattering theory of fractional Helmholtz operators and offers a framework suitable for numerical implementation of these nonlocal wave propagation models.",

Following the seminal work from Ghosh et al., the first one concerns the recovery of a potential (Calder\u00f3n-type problem) from the fractional Schr\u00f6dinger equation under nonlocal Robin-type exterior conditions. The second one involves recovering the solution of the space-fractional heat equation in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ from localized time-dependent measurements within a ball. To tackle these problems, we introduce new analytical tools such as a generalized weak Kelvin transform and a fractional Robin-to-Robin map.

In this paper, we focus on graph classes that capture incidence relations such as bipartite, co-bipartite, and split graphs. Concerning maximal irredundant sets, we show that the problem on co-bipartite graphs is as hard as in general graphs and tractable in split and strongly orderable graphs, the latter being a generalization of chordal bipartite graphs. As for minimal redundant sets enumeration, we first show that the problem is intractable in split and co-bipartite graphs, answering the aforementioned open question, and that it is tractable on $(C_3,C_5,C_6,C_8)$-free graphs, a class of graphs incomparable to strongly orderable graphs, and which also generalizes chordal bipartite graphs.",

We make an explicit study of this idea, developing some tools to check that constructions are well-defined.

We find a functor from completely positive maps to quantum relations, related to the idea of taking a noisy communication channel and reducing it to its underlying ``relation''. As with Quantum Graphs, at least in finite-dimensions, quantum relations correspond to ``adjacency operators'', certain CP maps depending on a choices of faithful functional on the algebras.

    "abstract": "We present rigidity results for overdetermined problems associated to the rotationally invariant Poisson equation $-\u0394_{g_\\mathcal{M}} u = f(r)$ in a model manifold $\\mathcal{M} = [0,S) \\times_h \\mathbb S^{N-1}$ with warping function $h$. The variable $r$ ranges in the interval $[0,S)$, whose endpoint $S$ is positive and possibly infinite. The first part of the paper deals with the problem \\[\n  \\begin{array}{ll}\n  -\u0394_{g_\\mathcal{M}} {u}=f(r) &\\mbox{in $\u03a9$},\n  u=\\varphi(r) &\\mbox{on $\\partial \u03a9$},\n  \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \u03bd} = \u03ba(r) &\\mbox{on $\\partial \u03a9$},\n  \\end{array} \\] where $\u03a9\\subset \\mathcal{M}$ is a bounded domain containing the point $O \\in \\mathcal{M}$ corresponding to $r = 0$, $\u03bd$ is the exterior unit normal vector on $\\partial \u03a9$, and $f$, $\\varphi$, $\u03ba$ are three prescribed functions.\n  In the second part of the paper, we consider a similar overdetermined problem for the exterior Bernoulli problem in a domain $\u03a9\\setminus \\overline B_{R_0}(O)$, where $B_{R_0}(O)$ denotes the geodesic ball centered at $O$ with radius $R_0$, within the class of functions that vanish on $\\partial B_{R_0}(O)$. In both cases, we give conditions on $f$, $\\varphi$ and $\u03ba$ implying that the solution $u$ is radial and $\u03a9$ is a geodesic ball centered at $O$. Our results apply in particular to the three space forms $\\mathbb{R}^N$, $\\mathbb{H}^N$ and $\\mathbb{S}^N$.",

    "title": "An algebraic theory of Lojasiewicz exponents",
    "abstract": "We develop a unified algebraic and valuative theory of Lojasiewicz exponents for pairs of graded families and filtrations of ideals. Within this framework, local Lojasiewicz exponents, gradient exponents, and exponents at infinity are all realized as asymptotic containment thresholds between filtrations, governed by integral closure. This reformulation shows that Lojasiewicz exponents are fundamentally valuative optimization problems.\n  The central structural contribution of the paper is a finite-max principle. Under verifiable algebraic hypotheses, the a priori infinite valuative supremum bounding the Lojasiewicz exponent reduces to a finite maximum, and computes the Lojasiewicz exponent precisely. We identify two complementary mechanisms leading to this phenomenon: finite testing arising from normalized blowups and Noetherian Rees algebras, and attainment via compactness of normalized valuation spaces under linear boundedness assumptions.\n  This finite-max framework yields strong structural consequences. We prove rigidity results showing that common extremal valuations force equality of Lojasiewicz ratios, and we establish stratification and stability phenomena for Lojasiewicz exponents in families, including fractional linearity and wall-chamber behavior along natural one-parameter deformations.\n  The theory recovers and explains classical results in toric and Newton-polyhedral settings, particularly, for Newton nondegenete case, where the Lojasiewicz exponent is computed by finitely many toric divisorial valuations corresponding to facet data.\n  Finally, we illustrate why the hypotheses underlying the finite-max principle are essential, delineating the precise scope of the theory.",

We propose an alternative conceptual viewpoint from an information-geometric and statistical perspective. Motivated by Bach[2023], we model training as learning an embedding of probability distributions into the space of quantum density operators, and in-context learning as maximum-likelihood prediction over a specified class of quantum models. We provide an interpretation of this predictor in terms of quantum reverse information projection and quantum Pythagorean theorem when the class of quantum models is sufficiently expressive. We further derive non-asymptotic performance guarantees in terms of convergence rates and concentration inequalities, both in trace norm and quantum relative entropy. Our approach provides a unified framework to handle both classical and quantum LLMs.",

We consider the problem of constructing graphs containing certain fixed small subgraphs.\n  We provide an optimal strategy for building a graph which contains a copy of $K_4$, showing that budget $b=\u03c9(\\max\\{n^8/t^5,n^2/t\\})$ suffices and that if $b=o(\\max\\{n^8/t^5,n^2/t\\})$ then no strategy can a.a.s. produce a graph containing a copy of $K_4$. This resolves a problem raised by I\u013ekovi\u010d, Le\u00f3n and Shu. More generally, we obtain analogously tight results for containing a wheel of any fixed size, or a graph consisting of a tree plus one additional universal vertex. We also tackle the problem of constructing graphs containing a copy of $K_5$, obtaining both lower and upper bounds on the optimal budget, though a gap remains in this case.",

    "abstract": "We study the $L^q$-regularity of the density of barycenters of $N$ probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the $p$-Wasserstein metric ($1<p<\\infty$). According to a previous result by the first author and collaborators, if one marginal is absolutely continuous, so is the $W_p$-barycenter. The next natural question is whether the $L^q$- regularity on the marginals is also preserved for any $q > 1$, as in the classical case ($p=2$) of Agueh--Carlier, or for $W_p$-geodesics ($N=2$). Here we prove that this is the case if one marginal belongs to $L^q$ and the supports of all the marginals satisfy suitable geometric assumptions. However, we show that, as soon as $N>2$, it is possible to find examples of $W_p$-barycenters which are not $q$-integrable, even if one marginal is compactly supported and bounded, thus highlighting the role played by the geometry of the supports. Furthermore, we provide a general estimate of the $L^q$-norm, including a detailed study of the sources of singularities, and a characterization of the $W_p$-barycenters \u00e0 la Agueh--Carlier in terms of the associated Kantorovich potentials. Finally, we explicitly compute the $W_p$-barycenters of measures obtained as push-forward of special affine transformations. In this case, regularity holds without any additional requirement on the supports.",

This paper presents the construction of cyclic codes over the finite field $\\mathbb F_{16}$ via the considered matrix ring $\\mathcal{R}$. In this connection, first, we discuss the structure of the ring $\\mathcal{R}$ and show that $\\mathcal{R}$ is isomorphic to the ring $( \\mathbb F_{16}+ v\\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\\mathbb F_{16} + v^3\\mathbb F_{16}) + u(\\mathbb F_{16} + v\\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\\mathbb F_{16} + v^3\\mathbb F_{16}) + u^2(\\mathbb F_{16} + v\\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\\mathbb F_{16}+ v^3\\mathbb F_{16}) + \\cdots + u^{k-1}(\\mathbb F_{16} + v\\mathbb F_{16} + v^2\\mathbb F_{16} + v^3\\mathbb F_{16})$ where $v^4=0, u^k=0, u^iv^j=v^ju^i$ for $i \\in \\{1,\\dots, k-1\\}$ and $j \\in \\{1, 2, 3\\}$. Then, we establish the form of ideals of the ring $\\mathcal{R}$ and related cyclic codes over $\\mathcal{R}$. Further, we show that these cyclic codes can be written as the direct sums of $\\mathcal{R}$-submodules of $\\frac{\\mathcal{R}[x]}{<x^n-1>}$, and derive the formula for the cardinality of cyclic codes over $\\mathcal{R}$. Then, we consider the Euclidean and Hermitian duals of the derived cyclic codes over $\\mathcal{R}$. Under the module isometry for $\\mathcal{R}$, we use the Bachoc map and the Gray map, which takes a derived cyclic code over $\\mathcal{R}$ to $\\mathbb F_{16}$. Finally, we provide some non-trivial examples of linear codes over $\\mathbb F_{16}$ with good parameters that support our derived results and compare a few codes with existing codes in the literature.",

    "abstract": "In \\cite{NZ25}, the authors resolved the rational function analogue of the finiteness results for greatest common divisors of iterates of polynomials established in \\cite{HT17}. These results may be viewed as dynamical generalizations of a classical problem concerning upper bounds for the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of two integer sequences studied by Bugeaud, Corvaja, and Zannier. The most delicate case arises when the maps involved are automorphisms, where the methods of \\cite{NZ25} and \\cite{HT17} rely heavily on Diophantine approximation and asymptotic analysis.\n  In the present paper, we develop an alternative approach to the automorphism case. This method is more powerful, allowing us to give complete answers to the further questions posed in \\cite{HT17}. In particular, we strengthen the main theorem of \\cite{HT17} and provide an alternative proof of the main theorem of \\cite{NZ25} in the automorphism setting.\n  Moreover, we relate this dynamical GCD problem to a special case of a higher-dimensional generalization of the Dynamical Mordell--Lang Conjecture proposed by Junyi Xie. We establish this generalized conjecture when the dynamics arise from algebraic group actions. In addition, we resolve the corresponding special case associated with dynamical GCD questions when the maps involved are polynomials.",

In its classical formulation, the IB method employs mutual information to evaluate the compression between the original and compressed data and the utility of the representation for the target variable. In this study, we investigate a generalized IB problem, where the evaluation of utility is based on the $\\mathcal{H}$-mutual information that satisfies the concave (\\texttt{CV}) and averaging (\\texttt{AVG}) conditions. This class of information measures admits a statistical decision-theoretic interpretation via its equivalence to the expected value of sample information. Based on this interpretation, we derive an alternating optimization algorithm to assess the tradeoff between compression and utility in the generalized IB problem.",
