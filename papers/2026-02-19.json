We suppose that the controlled process can not be observed, and at any time the control actions are chosen based on the observation of a related stochastic process perturbed by an exogenous Brownian motion. We describe a construction of the controlled Markov chain, having stochastic transition rates adapted to the observation filtration. By a change of probability measure of Girsanov type, we introduce the so-called separated optimal control problem, where the state is the conditional (unnormalized) distribution of the controlled Markov chain and the observation process becomes a driving Brownian motion, and we prove the equivalence with the original control problem. The controlled equations for the separated problem are an instance of the Wonham filtering equations. Next we present an analysis of the separated problem: we characterize the value function as the unique viscosity solution to the dynamic programming equations (both in the parabolic and the elliptic case) we prove verifications theorems and a version of the stochastic maximum principle in the form of a necessary conditions for optimality.",

These two problems were inspired by a conjecture of Stembridge stating that the Poincar\u00e9 series of reflections is rational and by the solution provided by de Man.\n  To address the first problem, we introduce reflection-prefixes, arising naturally from palindromic reduced words. We study their connections with the root poset, dominance order on roots, and dihedral reflection subgroups. Using $m$-canonical automata associated with $m$-Shi arrangements, we prove that the language of reduced words for reflection-prefixes is regular.

Unlike probabilistic zero forcing, RZF is governed by in-neighborhood structure and can fail to propagate globally due to directionality. The model extends naturally to weighted directed graphs by replacing neighbor counts with incoming weight proportions. We study the expected propagation time of RZF, establishing monotonicity properties with respect to enlarging the initial blue set and increasing weights on edges out of initially blue vertices, as well as invariances that relate weighted and unweighted dynamics. Exact values and sharp asymptotics are obtained for several families of directed graphs, including arborescences, stars, paths, cycles, and spiders, and we derive tight extremal bounds for unweighted directed graphs in terms of basic parameters such as order, degree, and radius. We conclude with an application to an empirical input-output network, illustrating how expected propagation time under RZF yields a dynamic, process-based notion of centrality in directed weighted systems.",

    "abstract": "We study nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation of probability densities under a total variation (TV) type penalty, sectional variation norm (also named as Hardy-Krause variation). TV regularization has a long history in regression and density estimation, including results on $L^2$ and KL divergence convergence rates. Here, we revisit this task using the Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) framework. We formulate a HAL-based maximum likelihood estimator (HAL-MLE) using the log-spline link function from \\citet{kooperberg1992logspline}, and show that in the univariate setting the bounded sectional variation norm assumption underlying HAL coincides with the classical bounded TV assumption. This equivalence directly connects HAL-MLE to existing TV-penalized approaches such as local adaptive splines \\citep{mammen1997locally}. We establish three new theoretical results: (i) the univariate HAL-MLE is asymptotically linear, (ii) it admits pointwise asymptotic normality, and (iii) it achieves uniform convergence at rate $n^{-(k+1)/(2k+3)}$ up to logarithmic factors for the smoothness order $k \\geq 1$. These results extend existing results from \\citet{van2017uniform}, which previously guaranteed only uniform consistency without rates when $k=0$. We will include the uniform convergence for general dimension $d$ in the follow-up work of this paper. The intention of this paper is to provide a unified framework for the TV-penalized density estimation methods, and to connect the HAL-MLE to the existing TV-penalized methods in the univariate case, despite that the general HAL-MLE is defined for multivariate cases.",

We consider two settings involving a finite dictionary of $M$ densities: (i) model aggregation, where $p$ belongs to the dictionary, and (ii) convex aggregation (mixture density estimation), where $p$ is a mixture of densities from the dictionary. Crucially, we make no assumption on the base densities: their ratios may be unbounded and their supports may differ. For both problems, we identify the best possible high-probability guarantees in terms of the dictionary size, sample size, and confidence level. These optimal rates are higher than those achievable when density ratios are bounded by absolute constants; for mixture density estimation, they match existing lower bounds in the special case of discrete distributions.\n  Our analysis of the mixture case hinges on two new covering results. First, we provide a sharp, distribution-free upper bound on the local Hellinger entropy of the class of mixtures of $M$ distributions. Second, we prove an optimal ratio covering theorem for convex sets: for every convex compact set $K\\subset \\mathbb{R}_+^d$, there exists a subset $A\\subset K$ with at most $2^{8d}$ elements such that each element of $K$ is coordinate-wise dominated by an element of $A$ up to a universal constant factor.

    "title": "Global dynamic stability of contact lines in fluids: 2-D droplet problem",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of an incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes fluid evolving above a one-dimensional flat surface. The fluid is subject to a uniform gravitational field and capillary forces acting along the free boundary. The interface between the fluid and the surrounding air is a free surface whose motion is driven by gravity, surface tension, and the fluid velocity field. The triple-phase intersections where the fluid, the air above the vessel, and the solid vessel wall meet are referred to as contact points, and the angles formed there are called contact angles. The model under consideration incorporates boundary conditions that allow for full motion of the contact points and dynamic contact angles. Under these conditions, \\cite{Yang} established the existence of equilibrium configurations for the model. These equilibria consist of a quiescent fluid occupying a domain whose upper boundary can be represented as the graph of a function in polar coordinates, minimizing a gravity-capillary energy functional subject to a fixed mass constraint. The equilibrium contact angles may take any value in $(0,\u03c0)$ depending on the choice of capillary parameters. In the present work, we develop a framework of a priori estimates for this model. We prove that, for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the system admits global solutions that converge exponentially fast to a (horizontally) shifted equilibrium state.",

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the null controllability problem for a class of quasilinear parabolic equations under multiplicative control, locally supported in space. For the purpose of proving the existence of a multiplicative control forcing the solution rest at a time $T>0$, we need to establish the decay property of solutions for the system without control first. We have obtained decay estimates for the $L^\\infty$-norm and the $H^1$-norm of solutions to the homogenous quasilinear parabolic equations. Notably, the decay of the $L^\\infty$-norm requires no smallness condition on the initial data, whereas the decay of the $H^1$-norm requires that the $L^\\infty$-norm remains small. Based on the decay estimates and maximum modulus estimate of solutions to quasilinear parabolic equations, together with the local null controllability of quasilinear parabolic equations under additive controls, we prove the null controllability of the quasilinear parabolic equations via multiplicative controls. As a byproduct, we also obtain the global null controllability for large time to the quasilinear parabolic equations via additive controls. Given that the controllability under multiplicative control is achieved over a long time horizon, we finally investigate the existence of time optimal control.",

    "abstract": "Chatterjee (2016) proved, as an application of his general framework relating superconcentration and chaos, that after the entries of an $n \\times n$ matrix drawn from the Gaussian unitary ensemble undergo an entrywise Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process for time greater than $n^{-1/3}$, the top eigenvector of the matrix becomes almost completely decorrelated from its initial position. More recently, Bordenave, Lugosi, and Zhivotovskiy (2020) showed that the same happens under a discrete resampling model, once more than $n^{5/3}$ randomly chosen entries of a Wigner random matrix are resampled. We generalize these results in several directions: (1) we analyze the decorrelation of any eigenvector under continuous and discrete resampling dynamics, (2) we analyze the discrete resampling process for generalized Wigner matrices with inhomogeneous variance profiles, (3) we analyze a combination of continuous and discrete resampling where an OU process is repeatedly run for a certain time on randomly chosen entries, and (4) we analyze a dependent version of resampling where entries grouped into \"blocks\" of arbitrary shapes are resampled together. In each case, we show that a given eigenvector decorrelates provided that enough entries have been resampled or that the associated dynamics have been run for a long enough time. Our proofs take a different approach from prior work, relying more directly on the characterization of eigenvectors as derivatives of eigenvalues and reducing the problem of establishing eigenvector noise sensitivity to variants of standard and robust properties of random matrices such as bounds on eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector delocalization.",

    "title": "Enhanced Connectivity in Ambient Backscatter Communications via Fluid Antenna Readers",
    "abstract": "Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power connectivity by allowing passive backscatter devices (BDs) to convey information through reflection of ambient signals. However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings.",

One of the advantages of considering an infinite sum in the nonlinearity term is being able to consider exponential nonlinearities, such as $e^{\u03b3|u|^{k}} u$, as well as sine or cosine nonlinearities, and obtain well-posedness in those cases, the first such result for most of those nonlinearities.\n  To conclude, we show numerical simulations for various examples of combined nonlinearities, including the double nonlinearity and an exponential one, then investigate the behavior of solutions with positive or negative initial $b$ in a quadratic phase data. Furthermore, we also show that a ground state in the NLS equation with combined nonlinearities no longer provides a sharp threshold for global behavior such as scattering vs. finite time blow-up, instead the equation has a much richer dynamics.",

This is motivated by the problem of describing possible pairwise intersection numbers of four curves in $(\\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ with prescribed Newton polytopes and generic coefficients. It is known that for arbitrary convex bodies in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the corresponding square-free polynomials are characterized by the Pl\u00fccker-type inequalities. We show that this characterization fails in the lattice setting: the interior of the space defined by the Pl\u00fccker-type inequalities contains integer polynomials that are and are not realizable by lattice polytopes. This phenomenon arises from additional arithmetic constraints on the mixed areas of lattice polytopes. These constraints become apparent when we study a \"discrete diagram\", which maps a pair of planar lattice polytopes to their mixed area together with their lattice widths in a given direction.",

To understand how these cognitive time scales shape population-level patterns, we propose and analyze a nonlocal population model with a cognitive map. The population density moves by a Fokker--Planck type diffusion driven by a cognitive map that stores a habitat quality information nonlocally. The map is updated through local presence with learning and forgetting rates, and we consider both truncated and normalized perception kernels.\n  We first study the movement-only system without growth. We show that finite perceptual range generates spatial heterogeneity in the cognitive map even in nearly homogeneous habitats, and we prove a lingering phenomenon on unimodal landscapes: for the fixed high learning rate, the peak density near the best location is maximized at an intermediate forgetting rate.\n  We then couple cognitive diffusion to logistic growth. We establish local well-posedness and persistence by proving instability of the extinction equilibrium and the existence of a positive steady state, with uniqueness under an explicit condition on the motility function. Numerical simulations show that lingering persists under logistic growth and reveal a trade-off between the lingering and total population size, since near the strongest-lingering regime the total mass can fall below the total resource, in contrast to classical random diffusive--logistic models.",

More importantly, we explore various stochastic modifications to adapt to practical scenarios, such as employing compression techniques for efficient information transmission, enabling partial participation for asynchronous communication, and utilizing coordinate selection for faster local computation. We show that the saddle point reformulation plays a key role and opens up possibilities to use mentioned extension that seem to be impossible in the standard minimization formulation.

We show that the associated Boltzmann measure d$\u03bc$ = exp(-g(x))dx satisfies a fixed-point property identity relating in a simple manner its degree-2n moments to the coefficients of g. This generalizes familiar identities for the exponential distribution (degree-1) on the positive orthant and the Gaussian measure (degree-2).

    "abstract": "Facility location problems (FLPs) are a family of optimisation problems with significant social impact. This class of problems has been the subject of study since the 1960s, with classical approaches including the Weber problem and the p-Median problem. Currently, more complex variations of these problems are being investigated. In particular, the Induced p-Median Problem with Upgrades (IpMU) represents a variation of the classical p-Median problem, where the concepts of transport cost and time are separated as distinct metrics in the input graph of the problem. Furthermore, the problem includes a budget which allows one to relax the graph costs, reducing the cost of the edges, thus improving the associated routes between the designated medians and the customers. In this study, a metaheuristic algorithm, based on the Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP), is proposed. A two-phase resolution scheme is defined, studying the median problem and the upgrading problem independently. In this approach, a larger set of state-of-the-art instances was analysed to ensure a fair comparison with previous proposals. In addition, the characteristics of the instances were studied to assess their complexity. The results obtained are promising when compared to the state-of-the-art, which is based entirely on mathematical programming models. The execution time was improved on average by two orders of magnitude for the harder instances, and the best known result was obtained in more than 99% of the tested instances.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces an alternative approach to proving the existence of choice functions for specific families of sets within Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) without assuming any form on the Axiom of Choice (AC). Traditional methods of proving choice, when it is possible without AC, are based on explicit constructing a choice function, which relies on being able to identify canonical elements within the sets. Our approach, instead, employs the axiom schema of separation. We begin by considering families of well-ordered sets, then apply the schema of separation twice to build a set of possible candidates for the choice functions, and, finally, prove that this set is non-empty. This strategy enables proving the existence of choice function in situations where canonical elements cannot be identified explicitly. We then extend our method beyond families of well-ordered sets to families of sets, over which partial orders with a least element exist. After exploring possibilities for further generalization, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition: in ZF, without assuming AC, a choice function exists for a non-empty family if and only if each set admits a partial order with a least element. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be used to prove the existence of choice functions for families of contractible and path-connected topological spaces, including hyper-intervals in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, hyper-balls, and hyper-spheres.",

We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model.\n  We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound.\n  On the constructive side, for any $q\\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies. These codes have efficient and systematic encoders. For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \\emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$. Furthermore, we give an improved construction of binary $1$-CECCs, a construction of nonbinary $1$-CECCs, and a construction of $t$-$(1,\\ldots,1)$-CECCs. These constructions are also systematic.",

We compute their stability indices, identify vertical self-resonant orbits up to multiplicity six, investigate the vertically bifurcated periodic solutions and discuss their orbital characteristics.

In this form, it was first written down by Thomassen in 1978, inspired by a closely related conjecture due to Lov\u00e1sz from 1969. It has been attributed to several other authors in a survey on the topic by Witte and Gallian in 1984.\n  The analogous question for vertex transitive digraphs has an even longer history, having been first considered by Rankin in 1946. It is arguably more natural from the group-theoretic perspective underlying this problem in both settings. Trotter and Erd\u0151s proved in 1978 that there are infinitely many connected vertex transitive digraphs which are not Hamiltonian. This left open the very natural question of how long a directed cycle one can guarantee in a connected vertex transitive digraph on $n$ vertices.\n  In 1981, Alspach asked if the maximum perimeter gap (the gap between the circumference and the order of the digraph) is a growing function in $n$. We answer this question in the affirmative, showing that it grows at least as fast as $(1-o(1)) \\ln n$. On the other hand, we prove that one can always find a directed cycle of length at least $\u03a9(n^{1/3})$, establishing the first lower bound growing with $n$, providing a directed analogue of a famous result of Babai from 1979 in the undirected setting.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a concept of passive, vibration-driven locomotion, in which a mechanical system achieves horizontal self-propulsion by resonantly harvesting energy from vertical environmental excitations (e.g. ambient vibrations of underwater pipelines), without a direct propulsive actuation. The system consists of a capsule containing an internal pendulum attached to its base mounted on a vertically vibrating substrate. The underlying locomotion mechanism relies on resonant energy transfer from the vertically vibrating substrate to the internal oscillatory element. Under appropriate forcing conditions and in the presence of asymmetric dissipative interactions, this internal oscillator induces a net unidirectional motion of the capsule. The analysis focuses on regimes of progressive motion arising in the vicinity of parametric resonances. Two asymptotic limits are considered: small-amplitude parametric excitation leading to a (2:1) resonant oscillatory motion of the pendulum, and large-amplitude excitation leading to a (1:1) resonant unidirectional rotational motion of the pendulum. Given the asymmetry of the dissipative force acting on the capsule, both resonant regimes result in a progressive motion of the capsule system. To identify optimal locomotion regimes in both cases, we employ tailored asymptotic approaches based on multi-scale expansions and direct averaging analysis. The resulting slow-flow and averaged-flow models reveal the full bifurcation structure of steady-state solutions associated with forward capsule motion for both low- and high- amplitude excitations. Analytical predictions are shown to be in good agreement with direct numerical simulations of the full capsule-pendulum system.",

    "title": "Numerical Construction of Quasi-Periodic Solutions Beyond Symplectic Integrators",
    "abstract": "Symplectic integrators are the established standard for long-term simulations of nearly-integrable Hamiltonian systems due to their preservation of geometric structures. However, they suffer from an inherent limitation: secular phase-shift errors. While the qualitative ''shape'' of invariant tori is preserved, the numerical solution gradually drifts along the torus, leading to a phase-lag accumulation that degrades long-term positional accuracy. Inspired by the Craig-Wayne-Bourgain (CWB) scheme, originally developed as an analytical tool for infinite-dimensional systems, we introduce a numerical operator that incorporates frequency updates into a dimension-enlarged Newton iteration to compute quasi-periodic solutions. Unlike conventional time-stepping integrators, our alternating numerical procedure eliminates phase-lag accumulation by directly solving for instantaneous positions and phase angles. Theoretically, provided sufficient computational resources, the phase error can be reduced arbitrarily, remaining independent of the total integration time. Our algorithm translates the Nash-Moser iteration into a practical numerical framework, marking a significant departure from traditional Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory. While KAM provides rigorous existence proofs, its requirement for global Diophantine conditions and the total exclusion of resonant sets render it numerically inaccessible. By employing a ''step-by-step'' exclusion process and incrementally enlarging the dimension, our algorithm resolves irrationality conditions locally. This approach demonstrates that the ''numerical irrationality problem'' is not an intrinsic barrier to computation, offering a constructive, executable alternative to the non-executable nature of global KAM-based methods.",

    "abstract": "A string attractor of a string $T[1..|T|]$ is a set of positions $\u0393$ of $T$ such that any substring $w$ of $T$ has an occurrence that crosses a position in $\u0393$, i.e., there is a position $i$ such that $w = T[i..i+|w|-1]$ and the intersection $[i,i+|w|-1]\\cap \u0393$ is nonempty. The size of the smallest string attractor of Fibonacci words is known to be $2$. We completely characterize the set of all smallest string attractors of Fibonacci words, and show a recursive formula describing the $2^{n-4} + 2^{\\lceil n/2 \\rceil - 2}$ distinct position pairs that are the smallest string attractors of the $n$th Fibonacci word for $n \\geq 7$. Similarly, the size of the smallest string attractor of period-doubling words is known to be $2$. We also completely characterize the set of all smallest string attractors of period-doubling words, and show a formula describing the two distinct position pairs that are the smallest string attractors of the $n$th period-doubling word for $n\\geq 2$. Our results show that strings with the same smallest attractor size can have a drastically different number of distinct smallest attractors.",

In characteristic 0 it essentially coincides with this inverse square root, however in general it is quite different, and unlike this inverse square root, it is locally summable.

For train operators on large rail networks it may be profitable -- with selected individual journeys -- to reduce energy usage during peak times and increase energy usage at other times rather than simply minimizing overall energy consumption. We will use classical methods of constrained optimization to find optimal driving strategies for a fleet of trains subject to limits on total energy consumption during specified intermediate time intervals but with no change to individual journey times. The proposed strategies can be used by a large rail organisation to reduce overall operating costs with only minimal disruption to existing schedules and with no changes to important departure and arrival times.",

Leveraging the probabilistic local updates mechanism, we propose a communication-efficient Adapt-Then-Combine (ATC) framework, FlexATC, unifying numerous ATC-based distributed algorithms. Under stepsizes independent of the network topology and the number of local updates, we establish sublinear and linear convergence rates for FlexATC in convex and strongly convex settings, respectively. Remarkably, in the strong convex setting, the linear rate is decoupled from the objective functions and network topology, and FlexATC permits communication to be skipped in most iterations without any deterioration of the linear rate. In addition, the proposed unified theory demonstrates for the first time that local updates provably lead to communication acceleration for ATC-based distributed algorithms. Numerical experiments further validate the efficacy of the proposed framework and corroborate the theoretical results.",

In this article we show that $\u03bc$ is an algebraic function, and consequently real-analytic on $[1,\\infty)$ outside a finite explicitly computable set. In particular, although no expression in radicals exists, the function admits convergent Taylor expansions at all non-exceptional values of $r$, whose coefficients may be computed by Newton iteration from the defining algebraic equation.

Computational experiments and a large-scale urban case study show substantial improvements over the current system, quantifying explicit trade-offs between efficiency, congestion control, fairness, and robustness.

The long-range interaction enters in momentum space in the form of the now efficiently computable Epstein zeta function, which exhibits a power-law singularity at zero momentum.

The MPO is applied directly in MPS form, and rank growth is controlled via canonicalization and SVD-based truncation after each step. We provide theoretical context through standard matrix product properties, including exact MPS representability bounds, local optimality of SVD truncation, and a Lipschitz-type multi-step error propagation estimate. Experiments on one- and two-dimensional linear advection-diffusion and nonlinear viscous Burgers equations demonstrate accurate short-horizon prediction, favorable scaling in smooth diffusive regimes, and error growth in nonlinear multi-step predictions.",

Secondly, in contrast to the purely Dirichlet case, a key challenge is to establish the non-vanishing of the tangential derivative of $u$ along the Neumann boundary. To address this, we employ local analysis techniques of angular derivatives, as introduced by Hartman and Wintner [Amer. J. Math., 1953]. Thirdly, we identify the signs of directional derivatives of $u$ along sections of the moving line. Using a planar sub-spherical sector as an example, we illustrate how these new innovative techniques and the moving plane method can be combined to derive symmetry and monotonicity results, particularly when the amplitude is less than or equal to $2\u03c0/3$.",

(2022). Since martingale techniques do not apply, we obtain the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions through a bespoke version of Slutsky's lemma: First, we overcome the lack of hypercontractivity by an iterated integration-by-parts scheme which reduces the remaining analysis to finite Wiener chaos; crucially, this argument relies on Malliavin differentiability of the nonlinearity but not on chaos decay and, as a consequence, encompasses the centred absolute value function. Second, in the spirit of the law of large numbers, we show that the diagonal of the second-order process converges to an explicit symmetric correction term. Finally, we compute all the moments of the remaining process and, through a fine combinatorial analysis, show that they converge to those of the Stratonovich Brownian rough path perturbed by an antisymmetric area correction, as computed by a suitable amendment of Fawcett's theorem. All of these steps benefit from a major combinatorial reduction that is implied by the original argument of Breuer and Major (1983).",

    "abstract": "We consider a stochastic heat equation with nonlinear multiplicative finite-dimensional noise that admits a unique nonnegative solution when given nonnegative initial data. Inspired by existing results for fully discrete finite difference schemes and building on the convergence analysis of semi-discrete mass-lumped finite element approximations, a fully discrete numerical method is introduced that combines mass-lumped finite elements with a Lie-Trotter splitting strategy. This discretization preserves nonnegativity at the discrete level and is shown to be convergent under suitable regularity conditions. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided, highlighting the role of mass lumping in ensuring nonnegativity and of operator splitting in decoupling the deterministic and stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to confirm the convergence rates and the preservation of nonnegativity. In addition, we examine several numerical examples outside the scope of the established theory, aiming to explore the range of applicability and potential limitations of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we build a procedure that allows to establish regularity and controls in time for probabilistic solutions to PDEs. Probabilistic approaches to global wellposedness problems usually provide ensemble bounds on the solutions. These bounds are the main tools to ensure convergence procedures yielding the existence and uniqueness of global solutions. A question of interest consists in transforming such ensemble bounds into individual controls on the flow ; this, among other uses, gives valuable information on the long-time behavior of the solutions. Toward such question of bounds transformation, Bourgain initiated a successful procedure that exploited the local wellposedness of the PDE, with an estimate of the time of size-doubling. In this note, we construct an estimation procedure which relies on a different local requirement. It turns out that this substitute is flexible enough to be possible to fulfill with the help of the ensemble bound itself. For applications of the procedure, we are able to provide new pathwise controls on solutions to NLS equations.",

Starting from a localized version of the Einstein-Hilbert variational principle, we encode the key aspects of the variational procedure in the form of a topology on a suitable space of variational configurations with low Sobolev regularity. This structure is the final topology with respect to the admissible variational maps and naturally lends itself to generalizations. We rigorously introduce two distinct types of topological variations, corresponding to the infinitesimal addition of disconnected components and to infinitesimal surgeries, both motivated by related physical concepts. Using tools from the theory of Sobolev spaces and precise asymptotics, we establish dimensional obstructions for the continuity and differentiability of the Einstein-Hilbert action with respect to these variations, and show that in the extended variational framework the action does not admit critical points in dimension $n=4$, while higher dimensions are free of this problem. Finally, we demonstrate the non-trivial effect of higher order curvature terms on the critical dimension.",

These results also extend to the complex setting for holomorphic Cantor sets in $\\mathbb{C}^d$.

In the continuum, QSSEP emerges as a non-commutative process, driven by free increments, conditioned on the algebra of functions on the ambiant space to encode spatial correlations.

We develop an equal-order virtual element method for the Stokes--Poisson--Boltzmann equations that naturally handles general polygonal meshes, including meshes with hanging nodes, without requiring special treatment or remeshing. The key innovation is a residual-based pressure stabilization scheme derived by reformulating the Laplacian drag force in the momentum equation as a weighted advection term involving the nonlinear Poisson--Boltzmann equation, thereby eliminating second-order derivative terms while maintaining theoretical rigor. Well-posedness of the coupled stabilized problem is established using the Banach and Brouwer fixed-point theorems under sufficiently small data assumptions, and optimal a priori error estimates are derived in the energy norm with convergence rates of order $\\mathcal{O}(h^k)$ for approximation degree $k \\geq 1$. Numerical experiments on diverse polygonal meshes -- including distorted elements, non-convex polygons, Voronoi tessellations, and configurations with hanging nodes -- confirm optimal convergence rates, validating theoretical predictions. Applications to electro-osmotic flows in nanopore sensors with complex obstacle geometries illustrate the method's practical utility for engineering simulations. Compared to Taylor--Hood finite element formulations, the equal-order approach simplifies implementation through uniform polynomial treatment of all fields and offers native support for general polygonal elements.",

In this paper, we show that for a broad class\n  of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph.

In this paper, we give a comprehensive answer to long-standing open complexity questions for three types of selection problems and three types of budgeted uncertainty sets. In particular, we demonstrate that the two-stage selection problem with continuous budgeted uncertainty is NP-hard, while the corresponding two-stage representative selection problem is solvable in polynomial time.

    "abstract": "We study online conformal prediction for non-stationary data streams subject to unknown distribution drift. While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift.\n  When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Thomassen famously proved that every planar graph is 5-choosable. We explore variants of this result, focusing on finding disjoint correspondence colorings, in the more general class of $K_5$-minor-free graphs. Correspondence colorings generalize list colorings as follows. Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $t$, a correspondence $t$-cover $\\textbf{M}$ assigns to each $v\\in V(G)$ a set of allowable colors $\\{1_v,\\ldots,t_v\\}$ and to each edge $vw\\in E(G)$ a matching between $\\{1_v,\\ldots,t_v\\}$ and $\\{1_w,\\ldots,t_w\\}$. An $\\textbf{M}$-coloring $\\varphi$ picks for each vertex $v$ a color $\\varphi(v)$ (from the set $\\{1_v,\\ldots,t_v\\}$) such that for each edge $vw\\in E(G)$ the colors $\\varphi(v),\\varphi(w)$ are not matched to each other. Two $\\textbf{M}$-colorings $\\varphi_1,\\varphi_2$ of $G$ are called disjoint if $\\varphi_1(v)\\ne\\varphi_2(v)$ for all $v\\in V(G)$. For every $K_5$-minor-free graph $G$ and every correspondence 6-cover $\\textbf{M}$ of $G$, we construct 3 pairwise disjoint $\\textbf{M}$-colorings $\\varphi_1,\\varphi_2,\\varphi_3$. In contrast, we provide examples of $K_5$-minor-free graphs and correspondence 5-covers $\\textbf{M}$ that do not admit 3 disjoint $\\textbf{M}$-colorings.",

Working initially at a fixed cosmological constant $\u039b>0$ and uniformly for $(M,a)$ in a compact slow-rotation set, using the meromorphic/Fredholm framework for quasinormal modes and a semiclassical equatorial labeling proved in a companion paper, we establish a quantitative two-mode dominance theorem in an equatorial high-frequency package: after exact azimuthal reduction, microlocal equatorial localization, and analytic pole selection by entire localization weights constructed from equatorial pseudopoles, the $k=\\pm\\ell$ sector signals are each governed by a single quasinormal exponential, up to an explicitly controlled tail and an $\\mathcal O(\\ell^{-\\infty})$ contribution from all other poles. We then develop a fully deterministic frequency-extraction stability estimate based on time-shift invariance, and combine it with the two-mode dominance result and the companion paper's inverse stability theorem to obtain an explicit parameter bias bound for ringdown-based recovery of $(M,a)$. Finally, using the companion paper's three-parameter inverse theorem and a damping observable based on the scaled imaginary part of one equatorial mode, we propagate the same deterministic error chain to a local bias bound for recovery of $(M,a,\u039b)$ on compact parameter sets with $|a|$ bounded away from $0$. As a further consequence, we obtain a localized pseudospectral stability statement for the equatorial resolvent package, quantifying how large microlocalized resolvent norms enforce proximity to the labeled equatorial poles. The resulting estimates clarify the conditioning mechanisms (start time, window length, shift step, and detector nondegeneracy) and provide a rigorous PDE-to-data interface for high-frequency black-hole spectroscopy.",

As shown in Li and Song (2017), it enjoys a convergence rate that is independent of the dimension of the predictor, thus avoiding the curse of dimensionality. In this paper we establish an improved convergence rate of GSIR under additional mild eigenvalue decay rate and smoothness conditions. Our convergence rate can be made arbitrarily close to $n^{-1/3}$ under appropriate decay rate and smoothness parameters. As a comparison, the rate of Li and Song (2017) is $n^{-1/4}$ under the best conditions. This improvement is significant because, for example, in a semiparametric estimation problem involving an infinite-dimensional nuisance parameter, the convergence rate of the estimator of the nuisance parameter is often required to be faster than $n^{-1/4}$ to guarantee desired semiparametric properties such as asymptotic efficiency. This can be achieved by the improved convergence rate, but not by the original rate. The sharpened convergence rate can also be established for GSIR in more general settings, such as functional sufficient dimension reduction.",

We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.",

    "abstract": "We introduce and analyze a nonlocal generalization of Whittle--Mat\u00e9rn Gaussian fields in which the smoothness parameter varies in space through the fractional order, $s=s(x)\\in[\\underline{s}\\,,\\bar{s}]\\subset(0,1)$. The model is defined via an integral-form operator whose kernel is constructed from the modified Bessel function of the second kind and whose local singularity is governed by the symmetric exponent $\u03b2(x,y)=(s(x)+s(y))/2$. This variable-order nonlocal formulation departs from the classical constant-order pseudodifferential setting and raises new analytic and numerical challenges. We develop a novel variational framework adapted to the kernel, prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions on truncated bounded domains, and derive Sobolev regularity of the Gaussian (spectral) solution controlled by the minimal local order: realizations lie in $H^r(G)$ for every $r<2\\underline{s}-\\tfrac{d}{2}$ (here $H^r(G)$ denotes the Sobolev space on the bounded domain $G$), hence in $L_2(G)$ when $\\underline s>d/4$. We also present a finite-element sampling method for the integral model, derive error estimates, and provide numerical experiments in one dimension that illustrate the impact of spatially varying smoothness on samples covariances. Computational aspects and directions for scalable implementations are discussed.",

    "title": "On the Coupled Cluster Doubles Truncation Variety of Four Electrons",
    "abstract": "We extend recent algebro-geometric results for coupled cluster theory of quantum many-body systems to the truncation varieties arising from the doubles approximation (CCD), focusing on the first genuinely nonlinear doubles regime of four electrons. Since this doubles truncation variety does not coincide with previously studied varieties, we initiate a systematic investigation of its basic algebro-geometric invariants. Combining theoretical and numerical results, we show that for $4$ electrons on $n\\leq 12$ orbitals, the CCD truncation variety is a complete intersection of degree $2^{\\binom{n-4}{4}}$. Using representation-theoretic arguments, we uncover a Pfaffian structure governing the quadratic relations that define the truncation variety for any $n$, and show that an exact tensor product factorization holds in a distinguished limit of disconnected doubles. We connect these structural results to the computation of the beryllium insertion into molecular hydrogen ({Be$\\cdots$H$_2$ $\\to$ H--Be--H}), a small but challenging bond formation process where multiconfigurational effects become pronounced.",

    "title": "Separating Oblivious and Adaptive Models of Variable Selection",
    "abstract": "Sparse recovery is among the most well-studied problems in learning theory and high-dimensional statistics. In this work, we investigate the statistical and computational landscapes of sparse recovery with $\\ell_\\infty$ error guarantees. This variant of the problem is motivated by \\emph{variable selection} tasks, where the goal is to estimate the support of a $k$-sparse signal in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main contribution is a provable separation between the \\emph{oblivious} (``for each'') and \\emph{adaptive} (``for all'') models of $\\ell_\\infty$ sparse recovery. We show that under an oblivious model, the optimal $\\ell_\\infty$ error is attainable in near-linear time with $\\approx k\\log d$ samples, whereas in an adaptive model, $\\gtrsim k^2$ samples are necessary for any algorithm to achieve this bound. This establishes a surprising contrast with the standard $\\ell_2$ setting, where $\\approx k \\log d$ samples suffice even for adaptive sparse recovery. We conclude with a preliminary examination of a \\emph{partially-adaptive} model, where we show nontrivial variable selection guarantees are possible with $\\approx k\\log d$ measurements.",

    "abstract": "We analyze independent policy-gradient (PG) learning in $N$-player linear-quadratic (LQ) stochastic differential games. Each player employs a distributed policy that depends only on its own state and updates the policy independently using the gradient of its own objective. We establish global linear convergence of these methods to an equilibrium by showing that the LQ game admits an $\u03b1$-potential structure, with $\u03b1$ determined by the degree of pairwise interaction asymmetry. For pairwise-symmetric interactions, we construct an affine distributed equilibrium by minimizing the potential function and show that independent PG methods converge globally to this equilibrium, with complexity scaling linearly in the population size and logarithmically in the desired accuracy. For asymmetric interactions, we prove that independent projected PG algorithms converge linearly to an approximate equilibrium, with suboptimality proportional to the degree of asymmetry. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results across both symmetric and asymmetric interaction networks.",

    "title": "Well-posedness and stability of the self-similar profile for a thin-film equation with gravity",
    "abstract": "We consider the thin-film equation with linear mobility and a stabilizing second-order porous-medium type term modeling gravity. The model admits self-similar solutions, and our goal is to analyze their stability. We reformulate the problem in mass-Lagrangian coordinates and exploit the underlying gradient-flow structure of the equation with respect to a weighted $L^2$ inner product, where the weight is given by the self-similar source-type profile. This framework allows us to establish a coercivity result for the Hessian (the linearization around the self-similar solution) in a suitably weighted inner product. As a consequence, we prove the convergence of perturbations toward the self-similar profile at an algebraic rate of order $t^{-\\frac 1 5}$, in arbitrary scales of weighted Sobolev norms. The analysis relies on maximal-regularity estimates for the linearized evolution, combined with appropriate estimates for the nonlinear terms.\n  Notably, beyond perturbative regimes and in contrast to previous results for the thin-film equation (convergence to the Smyth-Hill profile) or the porous-medium equation (convergence to the Barenblatt-Pattle solution), our analysis does not rely on an explicit (algebraic) representation of the self-similar profile. Instead, it is based solely on a systematic use of the ordinary differential equation satisfied by the self-similar solution, together with a careful analysis of its boundary asymptotics. As a result, we expect that the approach developed here can serve as a flexible toolbox for the study of more general classes of equations and for the stability analysis of special solutions in future work.",

A byproduct of our analysis is a (slightly) improved bound for the constant $c$.",
