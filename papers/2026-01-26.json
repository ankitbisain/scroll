In this paper, we introduce and analyze several Poisson-type spatial point processes. In particular, we propose and study a point process, namely, the generalized Poisson random field (GPRF), in which more than one point can be observed with positive probability, within a rectangular region having infinitesimal Lebesgue measure. A thinning of the GPRF into independent GPRFs with reduced rate parameters is discussed. Furthermore, we consider these processes indexed by the positive quadrant of the plane and analyze their fractional variants. Various distributional properties of these processes and related governing differential equations are obtained. Later, we define and analyze a spatial Skellam-type point process via GPRF. Moreover, a fractional variant of it in the two parameter case is studied in detail.",

The splitting is formulated as an exact operator splitting. The barotropic step handles free surface evolution and depth-averaged velocity via a well-balanced one-layer model, while the baroclinic step manages vertical exchanges between layers and adjusts velocities to their mean values. We show that the barotropic-baroclinic splitting preserves total energy conservation and meets both a discrete maximum principle and a discrete entropy inequality. Several numerical experiments are presented showing the gain in computational cost, particularly in low Froude simulations, with no loss of accuracy. The benefits of using a well-balancing strategy in the barotropic step to preserve the geostrophic equilibrium are inherited in the overall scheme.",

This framework represents a new class of stochastic bilevel programs, which are extensively utilized in the literature of operations research and management science, yet remain underexplored from the perspective of optimization theory. In this paper, we fill the gap. Specifically, we derive the first-order necessary optimality conditions in terms of Mordukhovich limiting subdifferentials. To this end, we formulate the bilevel program as a two-stage stochastic program with variational inequality constraints when the lower-level decision-making problem is convex, and establish an optimality condition via sensitivity analysis of the second-stage value function. In the case where the lower level optimization problem is nonconvex, we adopt the value function approach in the literature of bilevel programs and derive the first-order necessary conditions under stochastic partial calmness conditions. The derived optimality conditions are applied to several existing ILO problems in the literature. These conditions may be used for the design of gradient-based algorithms for solving ILO problems.",

A lot of work has been done for algebraic varieties and a number of proofs of Fontaine's conjectures have been obtained between years 1985 and 2011.

The method is derived from the approach of spectral deferred corrections and the idea of enforcing the algebraic constraints without numerical integration as in the approach of $\\varepsilon$-embedding in Hairer and Wanner (1996). It enforces the algebraic constraints to be satisfied in each iteration and allows an efficient solve of semi-explicit DAEs with high-accuracy. The proposed scheme is compared with other DAE methods.

Working over finite commutative Frobenius rings, we extract nondegenerate phase pairings, Weyl operator algebras, and quantum stabiliser codes directly from admissible phase data, without assuming Hilbert spaces, analytic inner products, or an externally imposed symplectic structure.\n  Within this framework, quantum state spaces appear as minimal carriers of faithful phase action, and stabiliser codes are identified canonically with self-orthogonal submodules under the Frobenius phase pairing. CSS-type constructions arise only as a special splitting case, while general Frobenius rings admit intrinsically non-CSS stabilisers. Nilpotent and torsion structure in the base ring give rise to algebraically protected quantum layers that are invisible to admissible Weyl-type errors.\n  These results place quantum stabiliser theory within Algebraic Phase Theory: quantisation emerges as algebraic phase induction rather than analytic completion, and quantum structure is information-complete at the level of algebraic phase relations alone. Throughout, we work over finite Frobenius rings, which are precisely the base rings for which admissible phase data become strongly admissible, and in this regime the full quantum formalism is forced by Frobenius duality.",

    "title": "Generalisation of Bureau-Guillot systems with Painlev\u00e9 transcendents in the coefficients",
    "abstract": "We construct a generalisation of what we call Bureau-Guillot systems, i.e. systems of first order equations with coefficient functions being Painlev\u00e9 transcendents. The same Painlev\u00e9 equation is related to the system and it appears as regularising condition in the regularisation process. The systems considered are birationally equivalent to the Okamoto polynomial Hamiltonian systems with rational coefficients for Painlev\u00e9 equations, hence they possess the Painlev\u00e9 property. This work extends the results of Bureau-Guillot in a two-fold way. On one side, we consider polynomial systems with degree larger than 2 that are free of movable critical points. These systems contain not only transcendents $\\text{P}_{\\text{I}}$ and $\\text{P}_{\\text{II}}$ in the coefficients, but also transcendents $\\text{P}_{\\text{III}}$, $\\text{P}_{\\text{IV}}$, $\\text{P}_{\\text{V}}$ and $\\text{P}_{\\text{VI}}$ (and/or their derivatives). On the other side, we explore examples of rational systems with the Painlev\u00e9 transcendents in the coefficients birationally equivalent to the Okamoto polynomial systems.\n  Lastly, we present a simpler version of the change of variables to obtain the analogues of the Bureau-Guillot systems. In this framework we discuss generalisations including the mixed case: systems related to the equation $(\\text{P}_{\\text{J}})$, with ${\\text{J}=\\text{I}, \\dots, \\text{VI}}$, containing coefficient functions that are solutions to $(\\text{P}_{\\text{K}})$ with $\\text{K}\\neq \\text{J}$. In the latter, the equation $(\\text{P}_{\\text{K}})$ appears as a regularising condition during the regularisation process. Although we are primarily interested in systems possessing the Painlev\u00e9 property, we also briefly discuss an analogous construction for systems including coefficient functions solving quasi-Painlev\u00e9 equation.",

The system dynamics are governed by a linear control model subject to path constraints.

The challenge is the presence of uncontrollable spillways: their discontinuous nature and the fact that they are activated at the state boundary prevent the application of known necessary conditions of optimality. To overcome this, we derive necessary conditions by approximating the original problem through a sequence of standard optimal control problems using exponential penalty functions. The applicability of resulting conditions are illustrated by an example.",

    "abstract": "We develop the representation theory intrinsic to Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) in regimes where defect and canonical filtration admit faithful algebraic realisation. This extends the framework introduced in earlier work by incorporating a representation-theoretic layer that is compatible with defect and filtration. In this setting, algebraic phases act naturally on filtered module categories rather than on isolated objects, and classical irreducibility must be replaced by a filtration-compatible notion of indecomposability forced by defect.\n  As a central application, we analyse the Frobenius Heisenberg algebraic phase, which occupies a rigid boundary regime within the broader APT landscape, and show that it satisfies the axioms of APT in a strongly admissible form. We study the representations realising this phase and show that their non-semisimplicity and rigidity properties are consequences of the underlying algebraic structure rather than analytic or semisimple hypotheses. In particular, we establish a Stone von Neumann type rigidity theorem for Heisenberg groups associated with finite Frobenius rings. For each such ring $R$, we construct a canonical Schr\u00f6dinger representation of the Frobenius Heisenberg group $H_R$, and show that, for a fixed nontrivial central character, every centrally faithful representation of $H_R$ is equivalent to this model.\n  The proof is entirely algebraic and uses no topology, unitarity, Fourier analysis, or semisimplicity. Instead, rigidity emerges as a boundary phenomenon governed by defect and canonical filtration. The Frobenius hypothesis is shown to be sharp: it precisely delineates the structural boundary within APT at which Heisenberg rigidity persists, and outside the Frobenius class this rigidity necessarily fails.",

Subsequently, we analyze the original Kostant game as a tool for generating positive roots, demonstrating its unique termination on simply-laced diagrams and its role in an alternative classification thereof.\n  The main contribution of this work -- which, to our knowledge, has not been studied before -- is a multi-vertex generalization of the game that allows for the simultaneous modification of multiple vertices of a Dynkin diagram. We prove that the resulting configurations of this new game establish a natural bijection with the elements of the quotient W/W_J of Weyl groups by parabolic subgroups. This formalism is applied to problems in algebraic geometry, specifically addressing cases of the Mukai conjecture via Hilbert polynomials, and is accompanied by a computational implementation in Java. These results offer new combinatorial perspectives for studying root counting problems, the regularity of reduced word languages, and the construction of Young Tableaux.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a Discrete de Rham (DDR) numerical scheme for solving linear elasticity problems on general polyhedral meshes, with a focus on preventing volumetric locking in the quasi-incompressible regime. The method is formulated as a nodal-based approach using the lowest-order gradient space of the DDR complex, enriched with scalar face bubble degrees of freedom that effectively capture the normal flux across element faces. This face-bubble enrichment is crucial for ensuring sufficient approximation flexibility of the divergence field, thereby eliminating the {volumetric locking} phenomenon that typically occurs as the Lam\u00e9 parameter $\u03bb$ approaches infinity. We establish $H^1$-error estimates that are independent of $\u03bb\\ge 0$, and depend only on the lower bound of $\u03bc$, guaranteeing robustness across the entire range from compressible to nearly incompressible regimes. We also show how to adapt our scheme to the frictionless contact mechanics model, maintaining a locking-free estimate for the primal variable (displacement). Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed {locking-free} method delivers accurate and stable approximations on general polytopal discretizations, even when the material behaves as an incompressible medium. The flexibility and robustness of this approach make it a practical alternative to mixed formulations for engineering applications involving nearly incompressible elastic materials.",

A key invariance in the busy phase collapses the dynamics onto a one-dimensional busy-start boundary, reducing preemption control to an optimal stopping problem. Building on this structure, we develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm with heavy-tail acceleration, employing a hybrid (uniform/log-spaced) action grid and a far-field linear closure. Simulations under Pareto and log-normal service times demonstrate substantial improvements over AoI-optimal non-preemptive sampling and zero-wait baselines, achieving up to a 30x reduction in average cost in heavy-tailed regimes. Finally, simulations uncover a counterintuitive insight: under preemption, delay variance, despite typically being a liability, can become a strategic advantage for information freshness.",

This method has seen success with the more particular Quadratic Chabauty method, but this method still applies only to certain curves. Previous applications of Chabauty--Kim beyond the quadratic level, as pursued by the authors, by S.

We use this to describe a general setup for non-abelian Chabauty for an arbitrary hyperbolic curve.\n  Our period map also connects the study of $p$-adic iterated integrals with Goncharov's theory of motivic iterated integrals, and allows us to investigate Goncharov's conjectures from a $p$-adic point of view. In particular, it suggests the possibility of evaluating syntomic regulators by writing elements of $K$-theory in terms of motivic iterated integrals. Lastly, it forms the basis for a certain generalization of the $p$-adic period conjecture of Yamashita for mixed Tate motives well-suited to applications in Chabauty--Kim theory.",

Our first key contribution is an explicit upper bound of generalized quadratic Gauss sums which is obtained by recursively applying Paris' asymptotic expansion and then bounding it by leveraging the fast convergence property of the Fibonacci zeta function. Building upon this major finding, our second key contribution includes four systematic constructions of order-optimal sequence sets with low aperiodic correlation and/or ambiguity properties via carefully selected Chu sequences and Alltop sequences. For the first time in the literature, we reveal that the full Alltop sequence set is asymptotically optimal for its low aperiodic correlation sidelobes.

The main basic contribution is in defining a notion of a Kraft matrix and in establishing the fact that a necessary condition for information losslessness of a finite-state encoder is that none of the eigenvalues of this matrix have modulus larger than unity, or equivalently, the generalized Kraft inequality asserts that the spectral radius of the Kraft matrix cannot exceed one. For the important special case where the FS encoder is irreducible, we derive several equivalent forms of this inequality, which are based on well known formulas for spectral radius. It also turns out that in the irreducible case, Kraft sums are bounded by a constant, independent of the block length, and thus cannot grow even in any subexponential rate. Finally, two extensions are outlined - one concerns the case of side information available to both encoder and decoder, and the other is for lossy compression.",

    "abstract": "The inverse of the star discrepancy, $N(\u03b5, s)$, defined as the minimum number of points required to achieve a star discrepancy of at most $\u03b5$ in dimension $s$, is known to depend linearly on $s$. However, explicit constructions achieving this optimal linear dependence remain elusive. Recently, Dick and Pillichshammer (2025) made significant progress by showing that a multiset union of randomly digitally shifted Korobov polynomial lattice point sets almost achieve the optimal dimension dependence with high probability.\n  In this paper, we investigate the analog of this result in the setting of classical integer arithmetic using Fourier analysis. We analyze point sets constructed as multiset unions of Korobov rank-1 lattice point sets modulo a prime $N$. We provide a comprehensive analysis covering four distinct construction scenarios, combining either random or fixed integer generators with either continuous torus shifts or discrete grid shifts. We prove that in all four cases, the star discrepancy is bounded by a term of order $O(s \\log(N_{tot}) / \\sqrt{N_{tot}})$ with high probability, where $N_{tot}$ is the total number of points. This implies that the inverse of the star discrepancy for these structured sets depends quadratically on the dimension $s$. While the proofs are probabilistic, our results significantly reduce the search space for optimal point sets from a continuum to a finite set of candidates parameterized by integer generators and random shifts.",

    "abstract": "Encoding digital information into DNA sequences offers an attractive potential solution for storing rapidly growing data under the information age and the rise of artificial intelligence. However, practical implementations of DNA storage are constrained by errors introduced during synthesis, preservation, and sequencing processes, and traditional error-correcting codes remain vulnerable to noise levels that exceed predefined thresholds. Here, we developed a Partitioning-mapping with Jump-rotating (PJ) encoding scheme, which exhibits exceptional noise resilience. PJ removes cross-strand information dependencies so that strand loss manifests as localized gaps rather than catastrophic file failure. It prioritizes file decodability under arbitrary noise conditions and leverages AI-based inference to enable controllable recovery of digital information. For the intra-strand encoding, we develop a jump-rotating strategy that relaxes sequence constraints relative to conventional rotating codes and provides tunable information density via an adjustable jump length. Based on this encoding architecture, the original file information can always be decoded and recovered under any strand loss ratio, with fidelity degrading smoothly as damage increases. We demonstrate that original files can be effectively recovered even with 10% strand loss, and machine learning datasets stored under these conditions retain their classification performance. Experiments further confirmed that PJ successfully decodes image files after extreme environmental disturbance using accelerated aging and high-intensity X-ray irradiation. By eliminating reliance on prior error probabilities, PJ establishes a general framework for robust, archival DNA storage capable of withstanding the rigorous conditions of real-world preservation.",

To this end, we formulate a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem and introduce an iterative joint power allocation and AP load balancing (JPALB) algorithm. The algorithm aims to reduce total power usage while meeting both the communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of URLLC users and the sensing QoS needed for target detection. Proposed JPALB algorithm for ISAC systems was simulated with maximum-ratio transmission (MRT) and regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoders. Simulation results show approximately 33% reduction in power consumption, using JPALB algorithm compared to a baseline with no load balancing, without compromising communication and sensing QoS requirements.",

The ensembles that we study have several groups of particles which can have different intensities of repulsion. They appear naturally in models of random domino and lozenge tilings, random partitions, supersymmetric gauge theory, asymptotic representation theory, discrete orthogonal polynomial ensembles, etc. We allow filling fractions to be either fixed, or free, or to vary while respecting affine constraints. We are interested in the macroscopic behavior of the distribution of particles, captured by linear statistics, partition functions, and their finite-size corrections as N is large. We prove the law of large numbers and large deviations for the empirical measure around the equilibrium measure. To reach finite-size correction we assume off-criticality. For fixed filling fractions, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the partition function and for the cumulants of linear statistics, in particular establishing a central limit theorem. For varying filling fractions, we prove that the central limit theorem is perturbed by an additional discrete Gaussian component oscillating with N. We apply our general results to the study of uniformly random lozenge tilings on a large class of domains -- not necessarily planar, simply-connected, nor orientable. When the analogues of filling fractions are fixed and this domain is orientable, we show that the Gaussian fluctuations on the vertical extend to the whole liquid region and are governed there by the Gaussian free field, as predicted by the Kenyon-Okounkov conjecture. We also establish a modification of the Kenyon-Okounkov conjecture in the non-orientable case. Complementarily, we prove discrete Gaussian fluctuations for filling fractions, when they are not fixed.",

We establish a rigorous mathematical backbone with forward invariance of the nonnegative cone and global-in-time well-posedness. Exploiting the decoupled drug equation $\\partial_t I=d_I\u0394I-\u03b3_I I$, we prove a long-time reduction during washout and show that the damped base dynamics admit no diffusion-driven (Turing-type) instability. We then formulate a directionality--damping principle: unidirectional (open-loop) sensing yields at most transient focusing, whereas bidirectional (closed-loop) feedback reshapes the effective mobility and produces explicit thresholds separating stable homogeneity, finite-band patterning (resistance niche formation), and aggregation when strong parabolicity is violated. Reproducible simulations corroborate this classification and highlight when flux regularization is required for physical realism.",

    "title": "Maximizing Reach-Avoid Probabilities for Linear Stochastic Systems via Control Architectures",
    "abstract": "The maximization of reach-avoid probabilities for stochastic systems is a central topic in the control literature. Yet, the available methods are either restricted to low-dimensional systems or suffer from conservative approximations. To address these limitations, we propose control architectures that combine the flexibility of Markov Decision Processes with the scalability of Model Predictive Controllers. The Model Predictive Controller tracks reference signals while remaining agnostic to the stochasticity and reach-avoid objective. Instead, the reach-avoid probability is maximized by optimally updating the controller's reference online. To achieve this, the closed-loop system, consisting of the system and Model Predictive Controller, is abstracted as a Markov Decision Process in which a new reference can be chosen at every time-step. A feedback policy generating optimal references is then computed via Dynamic Programming. If the state space of the system is continuous, the Dynamic Programming algorithm must be executed on a finite system approximation. Modifications to the Model Predictive Controller enable a computationally efficient robustification of the Dynamic Programming algorithm to approximation errors, preserving bounds on the achieved reach-avoid probability. The approach is validated on a perturbed 12D quadcopter model in cluttered reach-avoid environments proving its flexibility and scalability.",

We identify the Fourier symbol of the DtN operator and show it coincides with that of the fractional Laplacian, which yields an explicit Fourier-multiplier representation and allows construction of the corresponding fundamental solution. Using this representation we express the surface velocity as a convolution of the fundamental solution with the interfacial curvature forcing and analyze its normal limit to derive a boundary integral equation for the moving curve. Independently, exploiting the DtN representation we establish a curve-shortening identity: the interfacial perimeter decreases monotonically and its time derivative is controlled by $\\dot{H}^{1/2}(\\mathbb{R}^2)$-norm of the surface velocity. Building on the boundary integral equation, we prove local well-posedness via maximal $L^2$-regularity for quasilinear parabolic systems, employing a DeTurck-type reparametrization, and show equivalence with the original ILLSS system. Finally, we introduce a linearly implicit parametric finite-element scheme which captures experimentally observed relaxation dynamics.",

The study of bounding the spectral radius $\u03c1(G)$ of graphs on surfaces has a rich history that dates back to the 1990s. In this paper, we establish tight bounds for graphs of order $n$ that are embeddable on a surface with Euler genus $\u03b3$. Specifically, if graph $G$ achieves the maximum spectral radius, then \\begin{equation*} \\begin{array}{ll} \\frac32\\!+\\!\\sqrt{2n\\!-\\!\\frac{15}4}\\!+\\!\\frac{3\u03b3\\!-\\!1}{n}<\u03c1(G)<\\frac32\\!+\\!\\sqrt{2n\\!-\\!\\frac{15}4}\\!+\\!\\frac{3\u03b3\\!-\\!0.95}{n}, \\end{array} \\end{equation*} which improves upon the earlier bound $\u03c1(G)\\leq2+\\sqrt{2n+8\u03b3-6}$ by Ellingham and Zha [JCTB, 2000]. Furthermore, we prove that any extremal graph is obtained from $K_2 \\nabla P_{n-2}$ by adding exactly $3\u03b3$ edges, where `$\\nabla$' means the join product. As a corollary, for $\u03b3= 0$ and $n \\geq 4.5 \\times 10^6$, the graph $K_2 \\nabla P_{n-2}$ is the unique planar extremal graph, thereby confirming a long-standing conjecture resolved by Tait and Tobin [JCTB, 2017].\n  Let $K_r^n$ be the graph of order $n$ obtained by attaching two paths of nearly equal length to two distinct vertices of $K_r$. Integrating spectral techniques with considerable structural analysis on surface graphs, we further derive the following sharp bounds: $\u03c1(G) \\leq \u03c1(K_2 \\nabla K_4^{n-2})$ for projective-planar graphs, and $\u03c1(G) \\leq \u03c1(K_2 \\nabla K_5^{n-2})$ for toroidal graphs.

    "abstract": "Solving Stefan problems via neural networks is inherently challenged by the nonlinear coupling between the solutions and the free boundary, which results in a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, this work proposes an Operator Splitting Method (OSM) based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) to decouple the geometric interface evolution from the physical field reconstruction. Within a predictor-corrector framework, the method splits the coupled system into an alternating sequence of two linear and convex subproblems: solving the diffusion equation on fixed subdomains and updating the interface geometry based on the Stefan condition. A key contribution is the formulation of both steps as linear least-squares problems; this transforms the computational strategy from a non-convex gradient-based optimization into a stable fixed-point iteration composed of alternating convex solvers. From a theoretical perspective, the relaxed iterative operator is shown to be locally contractive, and its fixed points are consistent with stationary points of the coupled residual functional. Benchmarks across 1D to 3D domains demonstrate the stability and high accuracy of the method, confirming that the proposed framework provides a highly accurate and efficient numerical solution for free boundary problems.",

We derive compact generating-function formulas for waiting times and a Hadamard-generating-function calculus for head-to-head odds. Our main theorem shows that for a fair -sided die, stochastic dominance induces a total pre-order on all strings, ordered by expected waiting time. For binary coins, we also prove a converse: total comparability under stochastic dominance characterises the fair coin (), and any bias yields patterns whose waiting times are incomparable under stochastic dominance. In contrast, bias allows both (i) reversals between mean waiting time and win probability and (ii) non-transitive cycles; we give explicit examples and certified computational classifications for short patterns.",

    "abstract": "The 6G communication systems use mmWave and MIMO technologies to achieve wide bandwidth and high throughout, leading to indispensable need for beam alignment to overcome severe signal attenuation. Traditional sector-search-based beam alignment algorithms rely on sequential sampling to identify the best sector, resulting in a significant latency burden on 6G communication systems. Recently proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms based on the active learning framework address the problem, aiming to identify the optimal sector with the fewest possible samples under an identical sector partition. Nevertheless, these algorithms either lack feasibility (Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi, JSAC 2019) due to ideal assumptions or lack interpretability (Sohrabi, Chen and Yu, JSAC 2021) due to the use of end-to-end black-box neural networks. To avoid ideal assumptions and maintain interpretability, we address all above problems by proposing an adaptive beam alignment algorithm using the framework of noisy twenty questions estimation with a trained questioner. Specifically, we use two methods for training the questioner to eliminate reliance on ideal assumptions. The first method maps queries of twenty questions estimation to beamforming vectors via weighted summation of steering vectors, as an initial attempt to address the feasibility problem encountered in prior pioneering study by Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi (JSAC 2019). The second method uses multi-layer fully connected neural networks to achieve improved performance while only employing them to train the questioner, which can effectively mitigate the interpretability issues in prior study by Sohrabi, Chen and Yu (JSAC 2021). Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform all benchmark algorithms.",

While trivial maps such as translations and reflections exist, we formulate and solve the Non-Trivial Minimal Graph Transformation Problem, governed by a coupled system of partial differential equations. A central result establishes the rigorous equivalence of this original system to a modified problem for a harmonic function. Through a complex variable approach and a weakening technique, the analysis is reduced to solving a fundamental ordinary differential equation parameterized by a real constant k. The explicit integration of this ordinary differential equation involves various elliptic integrals and identities of elliptic functions. Solving the ordinary differential equation for the three cases: when the constant k equals zero, when k is greater than zero, and when k is less than zero yields the full classification of all admissible surfaces and their associated transformations. This process yields several classes of minimal surfaces that, to the best of the author's knowledge, constitute new families of minimal surfaces.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new kind of localized shock capturing for continuous (CG) and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws. The underlying framework of dissipation-based weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) stabilization for high-order CG and DG approximations was introduced in our previous work. In this general framework, Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstructions are used to calculate local smoothness sensors that determine the appropriate amount of artificial viscosity for each cell. In the original version, candidate polynomials for WENO averaging are constructed using the derivative data from von Neumann neighbors. We upgrade this standard `cell-cell' reconstruction procedure by using WENO polynomials associated with mesh vertices as candidate polynomials for cell-based WENO averaging. The Hermite data of individual cells is sent to vertices of those cells, after which vertex-averaged HWENO data is sent back to cells containing the vertices. The new `cell-vertex' averaging procedure includes the data of vertex neighbors without explicitly adding them to the reconstruction stencils. It mitigates mesh imprinting and can also be used in classical HWENO limiters for DG methods. The second main novelty of the proposed approach is a quadrature-driven distribution of artificial viscosity within high-order finite elements. Replacing the linear quadrature weights by their nonlinear WENO-type counterparts, we concentrate shock-capturing dissipation near discontinuities while minimizing it in smooth portions of troubled cells. This redistribution of WENO stabilization preserves the total dissipation rate within each cell and improves local shock resolution without relying on subcell decomposition techniques. Numerical experiments in one and two dimensions demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy and robustness for high-order elements.",

    "abstract": "We revisit noisy twenty questions estimation and study the privacy-resolution tradeoff for adaptive query procedures. Specifically, in twenty questions estimation, there are two players: an oracle and a questioner. The questioner aims to estimate target variables by posing queries to the oracle that knows the variables and using noisy responses to form reliable estimates. Typically, there are adaptive and non-adaptive query procedures. In adaptive querying, one designs the current query using previous queries and their noisy responses while in non-adaptive querying, all queries are posed simultaneously. Generally speaking, adaptive query procedures yield better performance. However, adaptive querying leads to privacy concerns, which were first studied by Tsitsiklis, Xu and Xu (COLT 2018) and by Xu, Xu and Yang (AISTATS 2021) for the noiseless case, where the oracle always provides correct answers to queries. In this paper, we generalize the above results to the more practical noisy case, by proposing a two-stage private query procedure, analyzing its non-asymptotic and second-order asymptotic achievable performance and discussing the impact of privacy concerns. Furthermore, when specialized to the noiseless case, our private query procedure achieves better performance than above-mentioned query procedures (COLT 2018, AISTATS 2021).",

This DD solver, called Generalized Optimized Schwarz Method (GOSM), is a substructuring method, that is, the unknowns of an iteration are associated with the subdomains interfaces. We extend the analysis presented in a previous paper of one of the author to a fully discrete setting. We do not consider only a specific set of boundary conditions, but a whole class including, e.g., Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin conditions. Our analysis will also cover interface conditions corresponding to a Finite Element Method - Boundary Element Method (FEM-BEM) coupling. In particular, we shall focus on three classical FEM-BEM couplings, namely the Costabel, Johnson-N\u00e9d\u00e9lec and Bielak-MacCamy couplings. As a remarkable outcome, the present contribution yields well-posed substructured formulations of these classical FEM-BEM couplings for wavenumbers different from classical spurious resonances. We also establish an explicit relation between the dimensions of the kernels of the initial variational formulation, the local problems and the substructured formulation. That relation especially holds for any wavenumber for the substructured formulation of Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, which allows us to prove that the latter formulation is well-posed even at spurious resonances. Besides, we introduce a systematically geometrically convergent iterative method for the Costabel FEM-BEM coupling, with estimates on the convergence speed.",

    "title": "On the Hausdorff stability of barcodes over posets",
    "abstract": "The Isometry Theorem of Chazal et al. and Lesnick is a fundamental result in persistence theory, which states that the interleaving distance between two one-parameter persistence modules is equal to the bottleneck distance between their barcodes. Significant effort has been devoted to extending this result to modules defined over more general posets. As these modules do not generally admit nice decompositions, one must restrict attention to the class of interval-decomposable modules in order to define an appropriate notion of bottleneck distance. Even with this assumption, it is known that bottleneck distance may not be equivalent to interleaving distance, but that it is Lipschitz stable under certain, fairly restrictive, assumptions. In this paper, we consider the more basic question of stability of the Hausdorff distance with respect to interleaving distance for interval-decomposable modules. Our main theorem is a Lipschitz stability result, which holds in a fairly general setting of interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, where intervals are assumed to be taken from any family satisfying certain closure conditions. Along the way, we develop some new tools and results for interval-decomposable modules over arbitrary posets, in the form of geometrically-flavored characterizations of the existence of morphisms and interleavings between interval modules.",

We establish a connection between perfect privacy and window-based redaction schemes, showing that erasing data up to a strong stationary time preserves privacy under suitable conditions. We further study an optimal sequential redaction mechanism and prove that it admits an equivalent window interpretation.

    "abstract": "We study Bayesian model selection in colored Gaussian graphical models (CGGMs), which combine sparsity of conditional independencies with symmetry constraints encoded by vertex- and edge-colored graphs. A computational bottleneck in Bayesian inference for CGGMs is the evaluation of Diaconis-Ylvisaker normalizing constants, given by gamma-type integrals over cones of precision matrices with prescribed zeros and equality constraints. While explicit formulas are known for standard Gaussian graphical models only in special cases (e.g. decomposable graphs) and for a limited class of RCOP models, no general tractable framework has been available for broader families of CGGMs.\n  We introduce a new subclass of RCON models for which these normalizing constants admit closed-form expressions. On the algebraic side, we identify conditions on spaces of colored precision matrices that guarantee tractability of the associated integrals, leading to Block-Cholesky spaces (BC-spaces) and Diagonally Commutative Block-Cholesky spaces (DCBC-spaces). On the combinatorial side, we characterize the colored graphs inducing such spaces via a color perfect elimination ordering and a 2-path regularity condition, and define the resulting Color Elimination-Regular (CER) graphs and their symmetric variants. This class strictly extends decomposable graphs in the uncolored setting and contains all RCOP models associated with decomposable graphs. In the one-color case, our framework reveals a close connection between DCBC-spaces and Bose-Mesner algebras.\n  For models defined on BC- and DCBC-spaces, we derive explicit closed-form formulas for the normalizing constants in terms of a finite collection of structure constants and propose an efficient method for computing them in the commutative case. Our results broaden the range of CGGMs amenable to principled Bayesian structure learning in high-dimensional applications.",

We further describe these orthogonal polynomials as denominators of Pad\u00e9 approximants to the logarithmic derivatives of solutions of the Picard-Fuchs differential equations associated with $Y$. This provides a new link between Pad\u00e9 approximation and the geometry of the non-ordinary locus, extending a classical observation of Igusa for the Legendre family and applying, in particular, to situations where the Picard-Fuchs equations do not admit modular solutions. As applications, we determine the three-term recurrence relations for Atkin polynomials attached to triangle curves via hypergeometric identities, and compute the supersingular locus of a double cover of the Teichm\u00fcller curve $W_{17}$.

This allows for a range of coefficients that explode to infinity on a bounded set. We establish that, in terms of Lp-strong error, the Lyapunov-tamed scheme is consistent and moreover achieves the same order of convergence as the standard Euler scheme for Lipschitz coefficients. The general result is applied to systems of mean-field particles with singular repulsive interaction in 1D, yielding an error bound with polynomial dependency in the number of particles.",
