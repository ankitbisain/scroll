    "abstract": "This article addresses the microlocalization of eigenfunctions for the semiclassical Schr\u00f6dinger operator $-h^2\u0394+V$ on closed Riemann surfaces with real bounded potentials. Our primary aim is to establish quantitative bounds on the spatial concentration of these eigenfunctions, extending classical results, typically restricted to smooth potentials, to the more general case where the potential is merely bounded. Our main result provides an explicit exponential bound for the $L^2$-norm of eigenfunctions on the entire surface in terms of their $L^2$-norm on an arbitrary open subset with an exponential weight of $Ch^{-1}\\log(h)^2$. This bound improves upon previous estimates for non-smooth potentials that was an exponential weight of $Ch^{-4/3}$. Our proof is based on a recent approach of the Landis conjecture develop by Logunov, Malinnikova, Nadirashvili and Nazarov (2025).",

In this setting, data are distributed over $M$ containers, and the objective is to guarantee that the contents of any failed container can be reliably reconstructed from the surviving ones. Unlike classical distributed storage systems, DNA data storage containers are fundamentally constrained by sequencing technology, since each read operation yields the content of a uniformly random sampled strand from the container. Within this framework, we consider several erasure-correcting codes and analyze the expected recovery time of the data stored in a failed container. Our results are obtained by analyzing generalized versions of the classical Coupon Collector's Problem, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a novel modelling and control framework for growth models that incorporate a size spectrum in conjunction with numerical computation and extensive field surveys. In fisheries management, the size spectrum, characterized by individual differences in body weight and length, is a critical factor, as it influences the physiology and ecology of fish, as well as the preferences of anglers. However, a comprehensive theoretical framework for fisheries modelling and management that accounts for the size spectrum has yet to be established. We apply a growth model that considers the size spectrum to Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis (Ayu), an important inland fisheries resource in Japan. Additionally, we introduce a novel stochastic control theory for the resource management of Ayu, taking its size spectrum into account. The growth model is calibrated using data collected annually from a river system in Japan. Our control problem addresses the size spectrum of fishing benefits and terminal utility (nonlinear expectation) for sustainability, resulting in a nonstandard problem to which the dynamic programming principle does not apply. We address this difficulty using a time-inconsistent formalism, where solving the control problem is reduced to finding an appropriate solution to a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. We numerically compute the system using the finite difference method and explore the fisheries management of Ayu at the study site.",

However, the associated inverse problem is severely ill-posed and requires robust regularization. While classical approaches primarily employ spatial smoothing, the temporal structure of cardiac dynamics remains underexploited despite its physiological relevance. We introduce a space-time regularization framework that couples spatial regularization with a learned temporal Fields-of-Experts (FoE) prior to capture complex spatiotemporal activation patterns. We derive a finite element discretization on unstructured cardiac surface meshes, prove Mosco-convergence, and develop a scalable optimization algorithm capable of handling the FoE term. Numerical experiments on synthetic epicardial data demonstrate improved denoising and inverse reconstructions compared to handcrafted spatiotemporal methods, yielding solutions that are both robust to noise and physiologically plausible.",

This can be seen as a tensorial form of a stochastic exponential; it thus is naturally intermittent, which transfers to the pair distance of the drift-diffusion process.\n  In this note, we quantify the intermittency of the geometric Brownian motion $\\{F_\u03c4\\}_{\u03c4\\ge0}$ on $\\textbf{SL}(n)$ also in dimensions $n>2$. We do so in two (related) ways: 1) by identifying the exponential growth rate for the $2p$-th stochastic moment $\\mathbb{E}|F_\u03c4|^{2p}$ with its anomalous dependence on $p$ (and $n$), and 2) by quantifying a non-tightness of $|F_\u03c4|^2/\\mathbb{E}|F_\u03c4|^2$ as $\u03c4\\uparrow\\infty$. It is the second property that transmits to the drift-diffusion process.\n  The arguments rely on stochastic analysis: We write $\\{F_\u03c4\\}_{\u03c4\\geq 0}$ as the solution of $dF=F_\u03c4\\circ dB$ with $\\{B_\u03c4\\}_{\u03c4\\geq 0}$ a Brownian motion on the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{sl}(n)$.

The method splits the dynamics into a stiff linear part, treated exactly via matrix exponentials, and a nonlinear part, integrated by a second-order dynamical low-rank (DLR) scheme. Our main contribution is a rigorous convergence proof showing that, under suitable assumptions, the overall scheme achieves second-order accuracy.

Due to the fact that the natural boundary condition on the magnetic field $H$ is the slip boundary condition, the Leray-Schauder fixed-point theorem, which have used to investigate the weak solution theory of the Navier-Stokes system, becomes invalid. To address such difficulty, we will invoke the Leray's approximation technique and the perturbation theory to seek a global weak solution to the Cauchy problem for MHD equations with large $L^3$-initial data. Our strategy provides a simple alternative (self-contained) proof of weak $L^3$-solution theory of incompressible Navier-Stokes system.

New characterizations and aspects of these structures, along with some important subclasses, are explored for non-associative algebras. By exploiting the observation that the twisting linear map in the hom-associativity axiom of one-sided unital hom-associative algebras is a left or right multiplication operator by an element of the algebra (obtained by the action of the twisting map on a corresponding one-sided unity), a new characterization of the multiplicative twisting operators (or, in other words, the multiplicative hom-associative algebras) is established for one-sided unital algebras. This demonstrates a strong connection between multiplicativity in hom-associative structures and the idempotents of the algebra, thereby further enhancing our understanding of the structure and special nature of multiplicative hom-associative algebra structures as a special subclass of arbitrary hom-associative structures with arbitrary linear twisting maps. Furthermore, new insights into subspaces and a subalgebra of hom-unities, algebra elements that induce hom-associativity by multiplication, are obtained. Moreover, since non-unital hom-associative algebras need not be twisted by a multiplication operator, a unitalization process is employed to describe a subalgebra of two-sided hom-unities that induce hom-associative structures on such algebras. This is formulated in terms of eigenspaces of multiplication operators within the algebra. Additionally, the obtained insights and general results about the structure and characterization of hom-algebra structures are applied to some important known general classes of non-associative algebras, such as commutative, possibly non-associative algebras, Cayley-Dickson algebras, Leibniz algebras, and hom-Leibniz algebras.",

In particular, we derive energy estimates and well-posedness for boundary inputs of low regularity (in appropriate trace spaces), even though the classical Dirichlet-to-Neumann framework is not directly applicable in the degenerate setting. As an application, we prove an approximate controllability criterion, which generalizes the Hilbert Uniqueness Method to degenerate wave equations.

These different interpretations give rise to two different microscopic stochastic models and therefore to two different techniques of probabilistic analysis.

    "title": "Multicasting Pinching Antenna Systems With LoS Blockage",
    "abstract": "Pinching-antenna systems (PASS) represent a promising customizable wireless access mechanism in high-frequency bands, enabled by dielectric waveguides and movable dielectric particles, called pinching antennas (PAs). In this work, we study optimal position allocation of PAs in PASS for multicasting in the downlink when a line-of-sight (LoS) link does not necessarily exist between all users and the PAs. The multicasting problem is solved by leveraging minorization-maximization (MM) principle to yield a provably convergent algorithm. In each run of the MM based procedure, we solve a convex surrogate problem using two methods called the candidate search method (CSM) and the bisection search method (BSM). With both BSM and CSM, we not only report superior performance of the multicasting PASS in non-LoS environments compared to conventional antenna systems (CAS), but also determine that BSM yields better overall computational complexity when the number of users and PAs increases. For example, we report that when we have 8 PAs and 25 users, the execution time with the CSM is approximately 2.5 times that with the BSM.",

    "abstract": "It is proved by M. Paun (1997, 2017) that the fundamental group of a compact Kahler manifold X is almost Abelian if the anti-canonical bundle -KX is nef. In this paper, we apply the recent geometric analytic theory of Kahler spaces developed by Guo-Phong-Song-Sturm to study fundamental groups of mildly singular compact Kahler varieties. We first extend Paun's result to log canonical pairs (X,Delta) with smooth X and nef -(KX+Delta) as well as to compact Kahler manifolds X with pseudo-effective -KX under a suitable assumption on the singularities of c1(-KX). We further prove that, for a 3-dimensional log canonical pair (X,\u0394) with X being klt, pi 1(X) is almost Abelian if -(KX+\u0394) is nef. Moreover, as one of the main ingredients for the proof of these results, we establish the surjectivity of the Albanese maps of compact normal complex varieties X in Fujiki class C that admits an effective R-divisor \u0394such that the pair (X,\u0394) is log canonical with nef anti-log canonical divisor -(KX+\u0394).This generalizes the corresponding theorems for projective varieties (Zhang, 2005), for klt pairs (Matsumura-Wang-Wu-Zhang, 2025) and for log smooth case (Fu-Han-Zou, 2025)",

    "abstract": "We study contextual chance-constrained programming under decision-dependent uncertainty. In this setting, a decision not only needs to satisfy constraints but also alters the distribution of uncertain outcomes. This dependency makes the problem particularly difficult: because feasibility probabilities vary with decisions, it creates both statistical endogeneity and computational intractability. To address this, we propose a nonparametric approximation method based on Contextual Cluster Weights (CCW). For any given decision and context, CCW constructs a local neighborhood (cluster) of ``similar\" historical observations and assigns them equal weight. This approach successfully renders both the objective and chance constraints tractable, while providing uniform-in-decision consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we develop reformulations that use pre-calculated clusters. We show that under a specific nestedness condition, these reformulations yield a convex feasible region, which allows for efficient solving. Experiments, including a case study with JD.com, demonstrate that our method outperforms benchmarks in solution quality, feasibility reliability, and runtime. This framework offers a scalable and data-driven approach for firms to make reliable operational decisions when their actions influence uncertainty. It effectively balances performance, risk, and robustness, while remaining interpretable and implementable in practice.",

This new path is less direct but it relates these inequalities to the quermassintegrals of convex bodies and to the local version of Viterbo's conjecture established by Abbondandolo and Benedetti for domains sufficiently close to the ball.\n  We then consider the problem of identifying convex bodies whose mean width cannot be decreased by natural classes of symplectomorphisms. We state a conjectured characterization of convex bodies whose mean width is already minimal among all their symplectic images. To test this conjecture we identify a simple class of quadratic convex bodies whose mean width can not be decreased by linear symplectic maps near the identity. We then identify a subset of these examples that fail to satisfy the toric conditions of the conjecture, and show that one can find a nonlinear symplectomorphism that decreases their mean width.",

First, by exploiting the analyticity of the Mittag-Leffler function and Muntz's theorem, we show that the simultaneous null controllability of the system can occur only for a countable set of realizations of the random diffusivity. In particular, this implies the impossibility of simultaneous null controllability for absolutely continuous random diffusivity. Next, we prove the lack of exact averaged controllability for absolutely continuous random variables, irrespective of the control time. Furthermore, we introduce a new two-parameter fractional characteristic function, which allows us to construct a class of random variables satisfying null averaged controllability at any time from any arbitrary sensor set of positive Lebesgue measure. This is achieved using an open-loop control belonging to L^\\infty and independent of the random parameter. In particular, we obtain the null controllability of the fractional biharmonic diffusion equation. Finally, we conclude with several remarks and open problems that merit future investigation.",

To achieve high energy efficiency (EE) in energy-constraint airships, a dynamic subarray structure is introduced, where each radio frequency chain (RFC) is connected to a disjoint subset of the antennas according to channel state information (CSI). The proposed joint dynamic hybrid beamforming network (DyHBFNet) comprises three key components: 1) An analog beamforming network (ABFNet) that optimizes the analog beamforming matrices and provides auxiliary information for the antenna selection network (ASNet) design, 2) an ASNet that dynamically optimizes the connections between antennas and RFCs, and 3) a digital beamforming network (DBFNet) that optimizes digital beamforming matrices by employing a model-driven weighted minimum mean square error algorithm for improving beamforming performance and convergence speed. The proposed ABFNet, ASNet, and DBFNet are all designed based on advanced Transformer encoders. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances spectral efficiency and EE compared to baseline schemes. Additionally, its robust performance under imperfect CSI makes it a scalable solution for practical implementations.",

Furthermore, we establish Ulam--Hyers stability criteria, demonstrating that small perturbations in the governing equations lead to proportionally small deviations in solutions. The theoretical advances are applied to the fractional FitzHugh--Nagumo model with delay (FHN-$\u03b1$-$\u03c4$), a neurodynamical system exhibiting both subdiffusive memory and discrete time delays. Our analysis yields rigorous conditions for the existence of limit cycles corresponding to action potentials, along with asymptotic stability criteria. The results reveal how fractional order $\u03b1$ and delay $\u03c4$ jointly modulate neural excitability thresholds and dynamic regime transitions. This work bridges fundamental fractional calculus theory with applications in mathematical neuroscience, providing analytical tools for systems where present evolution depends non-trivially on historical states and intrinsic fractional rates of change.",

    "title": "A Unifying Framework for Doubling Algorithms",
    "abstract": "The existing doubling algorithms have been proven efficient for several important nonlinear matrix equations arising from real-world engineering applications. In a nutshell, the algorithms iteratively compute a basis matrix, in one of the two particular forms, for the eigenspace of some matrix pencil associated with its eigenvalues in certain complex region such as the left-half plane or the open unit disk, and their success critically depends on that the interested eigenspace do have a basis matrix taking one of the two particular forms. However, that requirement in general cannot be guaranteed. In this paper, a new doubling algorithm, called the $Q$-doubling algorithm, is proposed. It includes the existing doubling algorithms as special cases and does not require that the basis matrix takes one of the particular forms. An application of the $Q$-doubling algorithm to solve eigenvalue problems is investigated with numerical experiments that demonstrate its superior robustness to the existing doubling algorithms.",

These methods can be extended to other transcendental functions.\n  As with the corresponding CF algorithms, computations are entirely in the domain of the CL representation, with no floating-point arithmetic; we read one CL input term at a time, producing the next CL term of the result as soon as it is determined.

    "abstract": "The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation, regarded as a gradient flow with manifold constraint, is the fundamental model describing magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. It is well known that the normalized tangent plane method is able to simultaneously achieve the non-convex manifold constraint and original energy dissipation. However, the associated computational cost of this numerical approach is exceedingly high. By contrast, the projection method is more straightforward to implement, while it often compromises the inherent energy dissipative property of the continuous model, and the error analysis turns out to be even more challenging. In this work, we first construct a linear and fully discrete finite difference numerical scheme, based on the projection method for the LLG equation, which is capable of simultaneously preserving the non-convex manifold constraint \\(|\\mathbf{m}| = 1\\) and an unconditional original energy dissipation. In the error analysis, the classical theoretical technique becomes ineffective, due to the presence of the nonlinear Laplacian term, which in turn poses a significant challenge. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we carefully rewrite the numerical method in an equivalent weak form, in which a point-wise length preserving feature of the numerical solution plays an essential role. As a result of these estimates in the reformulated weak form, an optimal convergence rate could be theoretically established. In our knowledge, this numerical method is the first linear algorithm that preserves the following combined theoretical properties: (i) point-wise length preservation, (ii) unconditional original energy dissipation, (iii) a theoretical justification of convergence analysis and optimal rate error estimate.",

In this paper, an information-theoretic framework is developed to model interspecies molecular communication (MC), where receptor responses are modeled probabilistically using a multinomial distribution.

We prove that the resulting stability conditions reduce to computationally tractable linear matrix inequalities and derive explicit formulas for the maximum tolerable delay perturbation. Building on this stability foundation, we design an adaptive controller governed by fractional-order parameter update laws with $\u03c3$-modification and a filter-based delay estimation mechanism that circumvents the need for classical state derivatives, which may not exist for fractional-order trajectories. The convergence analysis establishes ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop system with a computable bound that vanishes as the regularization parameters approach zero. Numerical validation on a three-neuron fractional Hopfield network with state-dependent transmission delays demonstrates that the proposed adaptive scheme reduces cumulative control energy by 99.3\\% and achieves an asymptotic state error two orders of magnitude smaller than a comparable fractional sliding mode controller.",

    "abstract": "A graph $G$ is called matching covered if all of its edges are contained in some perfect matching of $G$. Furthermore, a cycle $C \\subseteq G$ is called conformal if $G - V(C)$ has a perfect matching and $G$ itself is called cycle-conformal if all of its even cycles are conformal. Both matching covered graphs and conformal cycles play central roles in matching theory.\n  After a string of results from various authors, focused mainly on bipartite, planar graphs and claw-free graphs, a complete characterisation of all planar, cycle-conformal graphs has recently been presented by Dalwadi, Pause, Diwan, and Kothari [DMTCS, 2025]. We continue this exploration further into the realm of non-planar graphs, giving a characterisation of matching covered, cycle-conformal graphs that are bipartite and cubic, and respectively, those that are bipartite and Pfaffian. The last class plays a fundamental role in matching theory, having important connections to the problem of counting perfect matchings, recognising graphs with even directed cycles, and computing the permanent of certain matrices efficiently.\n  To prove our results, we break matching covered graphs down to their building blocks, the bipartite ones of which are called braces. The key to both characterisations are theorems that identify the braces in the respective classes. In particular, as our main results, we show that the cycle of length 4 is the only Pfaffian, cycle-conformal brace and we show that $K_{3,3}$ is the only cubic, cycle-conformal brace. In both cases these theorems facilitate the characterisations of the much richer classes of associated matching covered graphs. We conjecture that for each integer $\\ell \\geq 2$ the only $\\ell$-regular, cycle-conformal brace is $K_{\\ell,\\ell}$.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study the problem of securely computing a function over a network, where both the target function and the security function are vector linear. The network is modeled as a directed acyclic graph. A sink node wishes to compute a function of messages generated by multiple distributed sources, while an eavesdropper can access exactly one wiretap set from a given collection. The eavesdropper must be prevented from obtaining any information about a specified security function of the source messages. The secure computing capacity is the maximum average number of times that the target function can be securely computed with zero error at the sink node with the given collection of wiretap sets and security function for one use of the network. We establish two upper bounds on this capacity, which hold for arbitrary network topologies and for any vector linear target and security functions. These bounds generalize existing results and also lead to a new upper bound when the target function is the sum over a finite field. For the lower bound, when the target function is the sum, we extend an existing method, which transforms a non-secure network code into a secure one, to the case where the security function is vector linear. Furthermore, for a particular class of networks and a vector linear target function, we characterize the required properties of the global encoding matrix to construct a secure vector linear network code.",

    "abstract": "The least-squares estimator has achieved considerable success in learning linear dynamical systems from a single trajectory of length $T$. While it attains an optimal error of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ under independent zero-mean noise, it lacks robustness and is particularly susceptible to adversarial corruption. In this paper, we consider the identification of a networked system in which every node is subject to both noise and adversarial attacks. We assume that every node is independently corrupted with probability smaller than $0.5$ at each time, placing the overall system under almost-persistent local attack. We first show that no convex one-stage estimator can achieve a consistent estimate as $T$ grows under both noise and attacks. This motivates the development of a two-stage estimation method applied across nodes. In Stage I, we leverage the $\\ell_1$-norm estimator and derive an estimation error bound proportional to the noise level $\u03c3_w$. This bound is subsequently used to detect and filter out attacks, producing a clean dataset for each node, to which we apply the least-squares estimator in Stage II. The resulting estimation error is on the order $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ plus the product of $\u03c3_w$ and the number of misclassifications. In the event of perfect separability between attack and non-attack data, which occurs when injected attacks are sufficiently large relative to the noise scale, our two-stage estimator is consistent for the true system.",

Sensor placement optimality is quantified using the D-optimality criterion, and the problem is approached by leveraging connections with the column subset selection problem in numerical linear algebra. We implement a greedy approach for this problem, whose computational efficiency we improve using rank-one updates via the Sherman-Morrison formula. We additionally present an iterative algorithm that, for each feasible allocation of sensors, greedily optimizes over each sensor fidelity subject to previous sensor choices, repeating this process until a termination criterion is satisfied. To the best of our knowledge, these algorithms are novel in the context of cost constrained multifidelity sensor placement. We evaluate our methods on several benchmark state estimation problems, including reconstructions of sea surface temperature and flow around a cylinder, and empirically demonstrate improved performance over random designs.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the high-power capacity scaling of additive noise channels whose noise arises from the first-hitting location of a multidimensional drift-diffusion process on an absorbing hyperplane. By identifying the underlying stochastic transport mechanism as a Gaussian variance-mixture, we introduce and analyze the Normally-Drifted First-Hitting Location (NDFHL) family as a geometry-driven model for boundary-induced noise. Under a second-moment constraint, we derive an exact high-SNR capacity expansion and show that the asymptotic upper and lower bounds coincide at the constant level, yielding a vanishing capacity gap. As a consequence, isotropic Gaussian signaling is asymptotically capacity-achieving for all fixed drift strengths, despite the non-Gaussian and semi-heavy-tailed nature of the noise. The pre-log factor is determined solely by the dimension of the receiving boundary, revealing a geometric origin of the channel's degrees of freedom. The refined expansion further uncovers an entropy-dominant universality, whereby all physical parameters of the transport process -- including drift strength, diffusion coefficient, and boundary separation -- affect the capacity only through the differential entropy of the induced noise. Although the NDFHL density does not admit a simple closed form, its entropy is shown to be finite and to vary continuously as the drift vanishes, thereby connecting the finite-variance regime with the singular infinite-variance Cauchy limit. Together, these results provide a unified geometric and information-theoretic characterization of boundary-hitting channels across both regular and singular transport regimes.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is widely used to efficiently resolve localized features in time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) by selectively refining and coarsening the mesh. However, in long-horizon simulations, repeated intergrid interpolations can introduce systematic drift in conserved quantities, especially for variational discretizations with continuous basis functions. While interpolation from parent-to-child during refinement in continuous Galerkin (CG) discretizations is naturally conservative, the standard injection-based child-to-parent coarsening interpolation is generally not.\n  We propose a simple, scalable field-conserving coarsening operator for parallel, octree-based AMR. The method enforces discrete global conservation during coarsening by first computing field conserving coarse-element values at quadrature points and then recovering coarse nodal degrees of freedom via an $L^2$ projection (mass-matrix solve), which simultaneously controls the $L_2$ error. We evaluate the approach on mass-conserving phase-field models, including the Cahn--Hilliard and Cahn--Hilliard--Navier--Stokes systems, and compare against injection in terms of conservation error, solution quality, and computational cost.",

These methods effectively resolve the singularity near the boundary by combining properly designed Jacobi polynomials with a weighted variational formulation. A semi-implicit backward differentiation formula of second-order (BDF2) is employed for time marching, and its energy stability is rigorously proved. The resulting linear algebraic system possesses a sparse structure and can be efficiently solved. Numerical results verify the spectral convergence and efficiency of the direct spectral solvers, establishing them as a reliable tool for generating reference solutions for challenging benchmark problems. Furthermore, to achieve an optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, we compare several closure approximation models, including the industry workhorse Peterlin approximation (FENE-P), the quasi-equilibrium approximation (FENE-QE), and a novel neural network implementation for FENE-QE proposed in this paper (FENE-QE-NN).

Five compactness-type notions are defined ($\\mathfrak{a}$-compact, $\\mathfrak{a}$-Lindelof, countably $\\mathfrak{a}$-compact, $\\mathfrak{a}$-sequentially compact, $\\mathfrak{a}$-limit point compact) and their mutual relationships are determined. For transitive aura functions we obtain a concrete convergence criterion: $(x_n)$ converges to $x$ in $\u03c4_{\\mathfrak{a}}$ if and only if $x_n \\in \\mathfrak{a}(x)$ eventually. We show that $\\mathfrak{a}$-compact subsets of $\\mathfrak{a}$-$T_2$ spaces are $\\mathfrak{a}$-closed and that $\\mathfrak{a}$-compactness is preserved under $\\mathfrak{a}$-continuous surjections. On the connectivity side, $\\mathfrak{a}$-connected, $\\mathfrak{a}$-path connected, and $\\mathfrak{a}$-locally connected spaces are introduced; $\\mathfrak{a}$-components are $\\mathfrak{a}$-closed, and they are $\\mathfrak{a}$-open when the space is $\\mathfrak{a}$-locally connected. We construct subspace and product aura topologies. For products the inclusion chain $(\u03c4_{\\mathfrak{a}}) \\times (\u03c4_{\\mathfrak{b}}) \\subseteq \u03c4_{\\mathfrak{a} \\times \\mathfrak{b}} \\subseteq \u03c4_X \\times \u03c4_Y$ is established, with equality on the left when both scope functions are transitive. A Tychonoff-type theorem for transitive aura spaces is proved. All implications are shown to be strict by counterexamples.",

By reducing the governing equation to a nonlinear boundary value problem, we use variational methods to prove the existence of at least two distinct types of solutions: a ground state solution obtained via constrained minimization and an excited state of the saddle-point type obtained via the Mountain Pass Theorem. We derive bounds for the angular frequency $\u03c9$, the wave amplitude, and the domain size $P$, and provide explicit estimates for the exponential decay of the solutions. Furthermore, we implement a spectral-Galerkin formulation to numerically compute the profiles of fundamental $Q$-vortices, illustrating the saturation behavior of the soliton's amplitude and the asymptotic dependence of the frequency on a prescribed reduced norm and vortex winding number, as well as verifying the theoretical results and visualizing the topological phase structure of the solutions.",

Under the null hypothesis, the graph is a realization of an Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi random graph $G(n,q)$, while under the alternative hypothesis, the graph is the union of an Erd\u0151s--R\u00e9nyi random graph and a random perfect matching (or random spanning tree).

In order to represent data with interpretability in data science, researchers develop data-centric skeletonized low rank approximations. However, these methods might still suffer from accuracy degeneracy, nonrobustness, and high computation costs. In this paper, given existing skeletonized TT approximations, we propose a family of projection enhanced interpolation based algorithms to further improve approximation accuracy while keeping low computational complexity. We do this as a postprocessing step to existing interpolative decompositions, via oversampling data not in skeletons to include more information and selecting subsets of pivots for faster projections. We illustrate the performances of our proposed methods with extensive numerical experiments. These include up to 10D synthetic datasets such as tensors generated from kernel functions, and tensors constructed from Maxwellian distribution functions that arise in kinetic theory. Our results demonstrate significant accuracy improvement over original skeletonized TT approximations, while using limited amount of computational resources.",

The resulting limit theorem unveils a discrete hierarchy of phase transitions (i.e., exit times) as the truncation threshold $b$ varies, and manifests the catastrophe principle, whereby key events or metastable behaviors in heavy-tailed systems are driven by catastrophic behavior in a few components while the rest of the system behaves nominally.

After rescaling, this also yields the following new inequality for convex sets with (Lebesgue) barycenters at the origin: \\[ |K| |L| \\leq |K \\cap L| |K + L | ; \\] this can be seen as a conjugate counterpart to Spingarn's extension of the Rogers-Shephard inequality (where $K+L$ is replaced by $K-L$ above).

    "abstract": "We propose a multilevel tensor-train (TT) framework for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) in a global space-time formulation. While space-time TT solvers have demonstrated significant potential for compressed high-dimensional simulations, the literature contains few systematic comparisons with classical time-stepping methods, limited error convergence analyses, and little quantitative assessment of the impact of TT rounding on numerical accuracy. Likewise, existing studies fail to demonstrate performance across a diverse set of PDEs and parameter ranges. In practice, monolithic Newton iterations may stagnate or fail to converge in strongly nonlinear, stiff, or advection-dominated regimes, where poor initial guesses and severely ill-conditioned space-time Jacobians hinder robust convergence. We overcome this limitation by introducing a coarse-to-fine multilevel strategy fully embedded within the TT format. Each level refines both spatial and temporal resolutions while transferring the TT solution through low-rank prolongation operators, providing robust initializations for successive Newton solves. Residuals, Jacobians, and transfer operators are represented directly in TT and solved with the adaptive-rank DMRG algorithm. Numerical experiments for a selection of nonlinear PDEs including Fisher-KPP, viscous Burgers, sine-Gordon, and KdV cover diffusive, convective, and dispersive dynamics, demonstrating that the multilevel TT approach consistently converges where single-level space-time Newton iterations fail. In dynamic, advection-dominated (nonlinear) scenarios, multilevel TT surpasses single-level TT, achieving high accuracy with significantly reduced computational cost, specifically when high-fidelity numerical simulation is required.",

Two complementary routes to geometric ergodicity are developed for the marginal chain on the mixing variables. First, we show that the associated Markov operator is trace-class, and hence admits a spectral gap, over a large portion of the GIG parameter space. Second, for the remaining boundary and heavy-tail regimes, we establish geometric ergodicity via drift and minorization, subject to an explicit null-smallness condition that quantifies how the drift interacts with the null space of the observation operator. Together, these results cover the full GIG parameter space, including the normal-inverse Gaussian, generalized asymmetric Laplace, and Student-$t$ special cases. The geometric ergodicity of this chain underpins the consistency of Gibbs-based stochastic-gradient estimators for maximum likelihood estimation, and we provide conditions that make the required integrability checks transparent.

    "title": "Rich-ARQ: From 1-bit Acknowledgment to Rich Neural Coded Feedback",
    "abstract": "This paper reimagines the foundational feedback mechanism in wireless communication, transforming the prevailing 1-bit binary ACK/NACK with a high-dimensional, information-rich vector to transform passive acknowledgment into an active collaboration. We present Rich-ARQ, a paradigm that introduces neural-coded feedback for collaborative physical-layer channel coding between transmitter and receiver. To realize this vision in practice, we develop a novel asynchronous feedback code that eliminates stalling from feedback delays, adapts dynamically to channel fluctuations, and features a lightweight encoder suitable for on-device deployment. We materialize this concept into the first full-stack, standard-compliant software-defined radio prototype, which decouples AI inference from strict radio timing. Comprehensive over-the-air experiments demonstrate that Rich-ARQ achieves significant SNR gains over conventional 1-bit hybrid ARQ and remarkable latency reduction over prior learning-based feedback codes, moving the promise of intelligent feedback from theory to a practical, high-performance reality for next-generation networks.",

    "abstract": "We consider the problem of certifying (strict) $k$-sign consistency of a matrix, that is, whether all of its $k$-th order minors share the same (strict) sign. Although this problem is generally of combinatorial complexity, we show that for Hankel matrices it can be significantly simplified: our sufficient condition requires checking only the $k$-th order minors of a reshaped Hankel matrix with $k$ rows. Remarkably, when applied to the Hankel operator, this sufficient condition is also necessary. Comparable results were known only in the setting of (strictly) $k$-positive Hankel matrices and operators, in which all minors of order up to $k$ have the same (strict) sign.\n  More concretely, we derive a formula expressing the $k$-th order minors of Hankel matrices as nonnegative integer linear combinations of $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our derivation uses Schur polynomial theory to show that the $k$-th order minors of any matrix are nonnegative integer linear combinations of row-consecutive $k$-th order minors, meaning minors formed from distinct columns whose consecutive row indices need not coincide across columns. For Hankel matrices, these minors coincide -- up to sign changes arising from column swaps -- with the usual $k$-th order minors with consecutive row indices. Our main result then follows by showing that the sum of certain signed nonnegative integer coefficients equals the corresponding Littlewood--Richardson coefficients. In our problem, the nonnegativity of these coefficients ensures that negatively signed column permutations are cancelled by positively signed ones. Our results also extend naturally to Toeplitz matrices and operators, and we present a partial analogue for circulant matrices.",

We derive a duality formula for this transport-relaxed bridge and demonstrate that it reduces to a finite-dimensional concave optimization problem when the prescribed marginals are discrete and the reference distribution is absolutely continuous. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for both the primal and dual problems. Moreover, as the penalty blows up, we characterize the limiting bridge as the solution to a discrete Schr\u00f6dinger bridge problem and identify a leading-order logarithmic divergence. Finally, we propose gradient ascent and Sinkhorn-type algorithms to numerically solve the transport-relaxed Schr\u00f6dinger bridge, establishing a linear convergence rate for both algorithms.",

Directed transport and energy advection are treated by method-of-characteristics integration, yielding explicit directional sweeps defined by characteristic maps and inflow data. Scattering is incorporated through a fixed-point (source-iteration) scheme in which the angular gain is lagged, yielding a sequence of decoupled directional solves coupled only through angular sums.\n  The method is formulated variationally in a transport graph space adapted to the charged particle drift. Under standard monotonicity and positivity assumptions on the stopping power and boundedness assumptions on cross sections, we establish coercivity and boundedness of the transport bilinear form, prove contraction of the source iteration under a subcriticality condition and derive a rigorous a posteriori bound for the iteration error, providing an efficient stopping criterion.\n  We further analyse an elastic discrete-ordinates approximation, including conservation properties and a decomposition of angular error into quadrature, cone truncation and finite iteration effects. Numerical experiments for proton transport validate the characteristic sweep against an exact ballistic benchmark and demonstrate the predicted fixed-point convergence under forward-peaked scattering. Carbon-ion simulations with tabulated stopping powers and a reduced multi-species coupling illustrate Bragg peak localisation and distal tail formation driven by secondary charged fragments.",

Such geometric constraint systems arise in many real-world scenarios such as structural engineering and soft matter physics. When a geometric constraint system is flexible, it admits continuous deformations. The ability to explicitly compute such continuous motions is essential for analyzing the constraint system's quasistatic or elastic properties. However, this task is computationally challenging, even for comparatively simple geometric constraint systems, making numerical strategies attractive.\n  In this article, we present a general numerical framework for approximating continuous motions of geometric constraint systems given by quadratic polynomials. Our approach combines Riemannian optimization with numerical algebraic geometry to construct continuous motions via the metric projection onto the constraint set. By using homotopy continuation, we ensure that the computed motions correspond to genuine solutions of the constraint system and avoid numerical artifacts such as path-jumping. To handle singularities and over-determined systems, we introduce theoretical enhancements including randomization, adaptive step size control and a second-order analysis. These methods are implemented in the Julia package DeformationPaths.jl, which supports a broad class of geometric constraint systems and demonstrates its robust and effective performance across a wide range of test cases.",

    "title": "Leader-following Consensus over Jointly Connected Switching Networks is Achievable for Exponentially Unstable Linear Systems",
    "abstract": "The leader-following consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks has been a challenging problem and the solvability of the problem has been limited to the class of linear multi-agent systems whose system matrix is marginally stable. This condition is restrictive since it even excludes the most commonly used double-integrator system. This paper presents a breakthrough by demonstrating that leader-following exponential consensus is achievable for general linear multi-agent systems over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. The degree of instability can be explicitly characterized by two key quantities that arise from the jointly connected condition on a switching graph. By exploiting duality, we further show that the output-based distributed observer design problem for a general leader system is solvable over jointly connected switching networks, even when the system matrix is exponentially unstable. This is also in sharp contrast to the existing distributed observers, which rely on the assumption that the leader system is marginally stable.",

    "title": "Deep Variable-Length Feedback Codes",
    "abstract": "Deep learning has enabled significant advances in feedback-based channel coding, yet existing learned schemes remain fundamentally limited: they employ fixed block lengths, suffer degraded performance at high rates, and cannot fully exploit the adaptive potential of feedback. This paper introduces Deep Variable-Length Feedback (DeepVLF) coding, a flexible coding framework that dynamically adjusts transmission length via learned feedback. We propose two complementary architectures: DeepVLF-R, where termination is receiver-driven, and DeepVLF-T, where the transmitter controls termination. Both architectures leverage bit-group partitioning and transformer-based encoder-decoder networks to enable fine-grained rate adaptation in response to feedback. Evaluations over AWGN and 5G-NR fading channels demonstrate that DeepVLF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art learned feedback codes. It achieves the same block error rate with 20%-55% fewer channel uses and lowers error floors by orders of magnitude, particularly in high-rate regimes. Encoding dynamics analysis further reveals that the models autonomously learn a two-phase strategy analogous to classical Schalkwijk-Kailath coding: an initial information-carrying phase followed by a noise-cancellation refinement phase. This emergent behavior underscores the interpretability and information-theoretic alignment of the learned codes.",

    "title": "A Structural Criterion for the Applicability of Algebraic Phase Theory",
    "abstract": "Algebraic Phase Theory (APT) exhibits a striking asymmetry. In certain mathematical and physical domains it enforces rigidity, uniqueness of representation, and collapse of apparent degrees of freedom, while in most analytic or dynamical settings it is provably inapplicable. This paper identifies the structural origin of this selectivity.\n  We formulate a necessary and sufficient structural criterion characterising exactly when a nondegenerate Algebraic Phase Theory structure exists. The criterion isolates three conditions: the presence of nondegenerate phase duality, compatibility of admissible dynamics with phase interaction, and finite or terminating defect propagation. These conditions are jointly necessary and sufficient. When they are satisfied, phase theoretic rigidity is forced. When any one fails, no non-artificial phase structure can persist.\n  As a consequence, phenomena often regarded as exceptional, including Fourier decomposition, Bethe type exact solvability, rigidity of stabiliser codes, and uniqueness of canonical representations, are revealed to be structural necessities rather than contingent constructions.\n  This work positions Algebraic Phase Theory not as a universal modelling framework, but as a theory of structural inevitability. It clarifies both the explanatory power of APT and the precise boundaries of its applicability.",

    "title": "Data-Driven Discovery of Sign-Indefinite Artificial Viscosity for Linear Convection -- A Space-Time Reconvolution Perspective",
    "abstract": "Artificial viscosity is traditionally interpreted as a positive, spatially acting regularization introduced to stabilize numerical discretizations of hyperbolic conservation laws. In this work, we report a data-driven discovery that motivates a reinterpretation of this classical view. We consider the linear convection equation discretized using an unstable FTCS scheme augmented with a learnable artificial viscosity. Using automatic differentiation and gradient-based optimization, the viscosity field is inferred by minimizing the error with respect to the exact solution, without imposing any sign constraints. The optimized viscosity consistently becomes locally negative near extrema, while the numerical solution remains stable and nearly exact. This behavior is not readily explained within classical modified equation analysis and Lax-Wendroff-type arguments, which predict a strictly positive effective viscosity. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we reinterpret artificial viscosity as a space-time closure that compensates unresolved truncation errors while enforcing entropy stability through global dissipation balance rather than pointwise positivity. Within this framework, the Lax-Wendroff scheme corresponds to a degenerate projection in which temporal truncation errors are eliminated and reintroduced as spatial diffusion. We show that entropy stability constrains the integrated dissipation budget rather than the pointwise sign of spatial viscosity. As a result, locally negative viscosity naturally emerges as a numerical reconvolution operator that compensates for dispersive truncation errors. Negative viscosity is therefore not an unphysical diffusion process, but a scheme- and grid-dependent correction mechanism.",

To mitigate numerical dispersion and reduce pollution error, we employ fourth- and sixth-order compact finite-difference schemes, thereby significantly softening the strict points-per-wavelength requirement. The resulting large, ill-conditioned linear systems are solved using a preconditioned GMRES method. The key innovation lies in the construction of the preconditioner: we introduce two highly efficient direct solvers - one based on a low-dimensional eigenvector transformation (EigT) and another on a partial Fast Fourier Transform (PFFT) algorithm - both derived from a lower-order approximation of the original problem that incorporates the absorbing boundary conditions. The motivation and efficacy of this lower-order preconditioning strategy for high-resolution schemes are analyzed through model problems, providing insight into the convergence rate. The theoretical analysis is validated by a comprehensive set of numerical experiments, demonstrating the method's performance for realistic problem sizes and parameters.",

While Bayesian inverse problem methodologies provide a principled framework for assessing reconstruction reliability, commonly used Gaussian priors, such as Whittle-Matern models, impose globally homogeneous assumptions that limit their ability to capture such structure in large-scale settings. We introduce a new class of inhomogeneous priors defined via convolution with white noise, yielding nonstationary Whittle-Matern-type random fields with a rigorous mathematical construction. These priors fit naturally within existing Bayesian well-posedness theory and enable efficient sampling by reducing prior realizations to the solution of a pseudo-differential equation, for which we develop numerical schemes with quantified approximation error. Numerical experiments in one-dimensional denoising and two-dimensional limited-angle X-ray tomography demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality and uncertainty quantification, particularly in data-limited scenarios.",

    "abstract": "The evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE) fairness depends not only on its current state but, more critically, on its sensitivity to changes in Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters. However, the academic community has long lacked a predictive method connecting underlying topology to high-level service fairness. To bridge this gap, this paper analyzes a QoE imbalance index ($I$) through the lens of spectral graph theory.Our core contribution is the proof of a novel exponential spectral upper bound. This bound reveals that the improvement of QoE fairness exhibits an exponential decay behavior only above a performance threshold determined jointly by network size and connectivity. Its core decay rate is dominated by the weaker of two factors: the SLA stringency ($a$) and the network's spectral gap ($c\u03bb_2$). The upper bound unifies the service protocol and the topological bottleneck within a single performance bound formula for the first time.This theoretical relationship also reveals a clear bottleneck effect, where the system's fairness ceiling is determined by the weaker link between service parameters and network structure. This finding provides a bottleneck-driven principle for resource optimization in network design and enables goal-driven reverse engineering. Extensive numerical experiments on various random graph models and real-world network topologies robustly validate the correctness and universality of our analytical framework.",

We address this bottleneck by completing partially observed DtN measurements using a diffusion based generative model. Specifically, we train a conditional diffusion model to learn the distribution of DtN data and to infer full measurement vectors given partial observations. Our approach supports flexible source receiver configurations and can be used as a plug in preprocessing step with off the shelf EIT solvers. Under mild assumptions on the polygon conductivity class, we derive nonasymptotic end to end bounds on the distributional discrepancy between the completed and ground truth DtN measurements. In numerical experiments, we couple the proposed diffusion completion procedure with a deep learning based inverse solver and compare its performance against the same solver with full measurement data. The results show that diffusion completion enables reconstructions comparable to the full data baseline while using only 1% of the measurements. In contrast, standard baselines such as matrix completion require 30% of the measurements to achieve similar reconstruction quality.",

Active particles perform independent simple random walks. In contrast, although the sleeping particles do not move at first, they become active and start moving once touched by the active particles. Initially, only the origin has a single active particle, and the other sites have sleeping particles according to a Bernoulli distribution. After the original active particle starts moving, further active particles are gradually generated under the above rule and propagate across the lattice. The time required for the propagation of active frogs is expected to increase as the parameter of the Bernoulli distribution decreases, since fewer frogs are available. The aim of this paper is to investigate this increase in the vanishing density limit. In particular, we observe that it diverges and the rate of divergence differs significantly between $d=2$ and $d \\geq 3$.",

    "abstract": "This paper studies the complexity of projected gradient descent methods for a class of strongly convex constrained optimization problems where the objective function is expressed as a summation of $m$ component functions, each possessing a gradient that is H\u00f6lder continuous with an exponent $\u03b1_i \\in (0, 1]$. Under this formulation, the gradient of the objective function may fail to be globally H\u00f6lder continuous, thereby rendering existing complexity results inapplicable to this class of problems. Our theoretical analysis reveals that, in this setting, the complexity of projected gradient methods is determined by $\\hat\u03b1 = \\min_{i \\in \\{1, \\dotsc, m\\}} \u03b1_i$. We first prove that, with an appropriately fixed stepsize, the complexity bound for finding an approximate minimizer with a distance to the true minimizer less than $\\varepsilon$ is $O (\\log (\\varepsilon^{-1}) \\varepsilon^{2 (\\hat\u03b1 - 1) / (1 + \\hat\u03b1)})$, which extends the well-known complexity result for $\\hat\u03b1 = 1$. Next we show that the complexity bound can be improved to $O (\\log (\\varepsilon^{-1}) \\varepsilon^{2 (\\hat\u03b1 - 1) / (1 + 3 \\hat\u03b1)})$ if the stepsize is updated by the universal scheme. We illustrate our complexity results by numerical examples arising from elliptic equations with a non-Lipschitz term.",

Taking the limit of the number of line segments to infinity yields the class of convex bodies called zonoids, which can also be viewed as the expectation of a random line segment. Expanding on this interpretation, we analogously define operanoids as the expectation of a random affine image of an operator norm ball. In studying the properties of operanoids when the dimension of the operator norm ball grows, we arrive at a new asymptotic regime for limits of convex bodies. This leads to the more general class of convex bodies called noncommutative zonoids, and we use the framework of free probability theory to illustrate basic properties and examples.

    "abstract": "In state estimation tasks, the usual assumption of exactly known disturbance distribution is often unrealistic and renders the estimator fragile in practice. The recently emerging Wasserstein distributionally robust state estimation (DRSE) design can partially mitigate this fragility; however, its worst-case distribution is provably discrete, which deviates from the inherent continuity of real-world distributions and results in over-pessimism. In this work, we develop a new Sinkhorn DRSE design within system level synthesis scheme with the aim of shaping the closed-loop errors under the unknown continuous disturbance distribution. For uncertainty description, we adopt the Sinkhorn ambiguity set that includes an entropic regularizer to penalize non-smooth and discrete distributions within a Wasserstein ball. We present the first result of finite-sample probabilistic guarantee of the Sinkhorn ambiguity set. Then we analyze the limiting properties of our Sinkhorn DRSE design, thereby highlighting its close connection with the generic $\\mathcal{H}_2$ design and Wasserstein DRSE. To tackle the min-max optimization problem, we reformulate it as a finite-dimensional convex program through duality theory. By identifying a compact subset of the feasible set guaranteed to enclose the global optimum, we develop a tailored Frank-Wolfe solution algorithm and formally establish its convergence rate. The advantage of Sinkhorn DRSE over existing design schemes is verified through numerical case studies.",

    "abstract": "Blockchain offers a decentralized trust framework for the Internet of Things (IoT), yet deploying consensus in spectrum-congested and dynamic wireless edge IoT networks faces fundamental obstacles: traditional BFT protocols are spectrum-ignorant, leading to inefficient resource utilization and fragile progress under time-varying interference. This paper presents \\textit{Wireless Streamlet}, a spectrum-aware and cognitive consensus protocol tailored for wireless edge IoT. Building on Streamlet's streamlined structure, we introduce a \\textit{Channel-Aware Leader Election (CALE)} mechanism. CALE serves as a verifiable cross-layer cognitive engine that leverages receiver-measured channel state information (CSI) piggybacked in signed votes to derive Byzantine-robust connectivity scores from notarization certificates, and deterministically selects a unique weighted leader per epoch from finalized history, thereby improving proposal dissemination reliability under deep fading. Complementing this cognitive adaptation, Wireless Streamlet exploits the single-hop broadcast medium and a deterministic TDMA voting schedule to achieve linear per-epoch on-air transmissions (slot complexity), ensuring deterministic spectral access. To address the communication-storage trade-off, we further propose a coded dual-chain architecture that decouples header-only consensus (State Chain) from payload data (Data Chain). By employing erasure coding and on-chain integrity commitments, the system minimizes redundant spectrum usage for data retrieval while ensuring availability. Experiments show that Wireless Streamlet achieves higher throughput and lower confirmation latency than representative baselines in lossy environments, while substantially reducing per-node storage, demonstrating the efficacy of integrating cognitive sensing into consensus logic.",

    "abstract": "Inverse optimal control (IOC) aims to estimate the underlying cost that governs the observed behavior of an expert system. However, in practical scenarios, the collected data is often corrupted by noise, which poses significant challenges for accurate cost function recovery. In this work, we propose an IOC framework that effectively addresses the presence of observation noise. In particular, compared to our previous work \\cite{wang2025consistent}, we consider the case of discrete-time, infinite-horizon, discounted MDPs whose transition kernel is only weak Feller. By leveraging the occupation measure framework, we first establish the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the expert policy and then construct an infinite dimensional optimization problem based on these conditions. This problem is then approximated by polynomials to get a finite-dimensional numerically solvable one, which relies on the moments of the state-action trajectory's occupation measure. More specifically, the moments are robustly estimated from the noisy observations by a combined misspecified Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator derived from observation model and system dynamics. Consequently, the entire algorithm is based on convex optimization which alleviates the issues that arise from local minima and is asymptotically and statistically consistent. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is illustrated through numerical examples.",

For multiuser wideband MA systems, this paper proposes deep learning-based framework integrating channel estimation (CE), antenna position optimization, and beamforming, with a clear workflow and enhanced efficiency. Specifically, to obtain accurate channel state information (CSI), we design a two-stage CE mechanism: first reconstructing the channel matrix from limited measurements via compressive sensing, then introducing a Swin-Transformer-based denoising network to refine CE accuracy for subsequent optimization. Building on this, we address the joint optimization challenge by proposing a Transformer-based network that intelligently maps CSI sequences of candidate positions to optimal MA positions while combining a model-driven weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) beamforming approach to achieve better performance.

In the purely polynomial case this implies eventual polynomiality in n.

The position matrix of a single-shelf shuffling encodes the probability that the $i$-th incoming card is in position $j$ after one round of single-shelf shuffle. The spectral properties of the position matrix of card shuffling schemes are helpful in the analysis of card guessing games without feedback. In this paper, we determine the full spectrum and the corresponding eigenspaces of the position matrix $M$ of a single-shelf shuffle. This strengthens and resolves two conjectures in a recent work [arXiv:2507.10294]. As a consequence of these results, we show that the maximum number of expected correct guesses without feedback after $k\\geq (1+\u03b5)$ many shuffles is of the order $1+O(n^{-2\u03b5})$. On the other hand, the expected number of correct guesses after one shuffle is at most $\\sqrt{2n/\u03c0}+1+O(n^{-1/2})$, and we give a strategy (not optimal) that achieves $\\sqrt{2n/\u03c0}-1$ number of correct cards in expectation.",

In this paper we look at three possible solutions to the problem. The first, from Klein himself, involving logarithms, the second from Paul and Judith Sally involving lattice geometry, and the third from Dick Stanley involving an investigation of the box problem from high school calculus. We see that the first two examples proceed upon a vertical trajectory while the third example proceeds horizontally.

However, existing work on mixed-logit pricing largely focuses on unconstrained settings, limiting its applicability in practice where prices are subject to business or regulatory constraints. We study the constrained pricing problem under multinomial and mixed logit demand models. For the multinomial logit model, corresponding to a single customer segment, we show that the constrained pricing problem admits a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) via a reformulation based on exponential cone programming, yielding an $\\varepsilon$-optimal solution in polynomial time. For finite mixed logit models with $T$ customer segments, we reformulate the problem as a bilinear exponential cone program with $O(T)$ bilinear terms. This structure enables a Branch-and-Bound algorithm whose complexity is exponential only in $T$. Consequently, constrained pricing under finite mixtures of logit admits a PTAS when the number of customer segments is bounded. Numerical experiments demonstrate strong performance relative to state-of-the-art baselines.",

Yet, optimization problems in ML often have nonsmooth derivatives, which makes the existing convergence rate theory of second-order methods inapplicable. In this paper, we propose a new semismooth Newton method (SSN) that enjoys both global convergence rates and asymptotic superlinear convergence without requiring second-order differentiability. Crucially, our method does not require (generalized) Hessians to be evaluated at each iteration but only periodically, and it reuses stale Hessians otherwise (i.e., it performs lazy Hessian updates), saving compute cost and often leading to significant speedups in time, whilst still maintaining strong global and local convergence rate guarantees. We develop our theory in an infinite-dimensional setting and illustrate it with numerical experiments on matrix factorization and neural networks with Lipschitz constraints.",

    "abstract": "The Lasso is one of the most ubiquitous methods for variable selection in high-dimensional linear regression and has been studied extensively under different regimes. In a particular asymptotic setup entailing $n/p\\to \\text{constant}$, an i.i.d.~Gaussian $X$ matrix and linear sparsity, \\citet{su2017false} analyzed the Lasso selection path and presented negative results, showing that maintaining small levels of the false discovery proportion comes at a substantial cost in power. Followup work by \\citet{wang2020bridge} used the same framework to study the tradeoff between type I error and power for thresholded-Lasso selection, which ranks the variables based on the magnitude of the Lasso estimate instead of the order of appearance on the Lasso path, and demonstrated that significant improvements are possible if the regularization parameter is chosen appropriately. We take this line of research a step further, seeking an {\\em optimal} selection procedure in the AMP framework among procedures that order the variables by some univariate function of the Lasso estimate at a fixed value $\u03bb$ of the regularization term. Observing that the model for the Lasso estimates effectively reduces asymptotically to a version of the well-studied two-groups model, we propose an empirical Bayes variable selection procedure based on an estimate of the local false discovery rate. We extend existing results in the AMP framework to obtain exact predictions for the curve describing the asymptotic tradeoff between type I error and power of this procedure. Additionally, we prove that the optimal $\u03bb$ is the minimizer of the asymptotic mean squared error, and accordingly propose to use the empirical Bayes procedure with $\u03bb$ estimated by cross-validation. The theoretical predictions imply that the gains in power can be substantial, and we confirm this by numerical studies under different settings.",

    "abstract": "Branch-price-and-cut is the state-of-the-art exact method for solving many types of vehicle routing problems, and is particularly effective for vehicle routing problems with time windows. A well-known challenge in branch-price-and-cut is that the generation of columns is guided by information from the linear relaxation of the master problem, with no guarantee that they will be useful from an integer perspective. As a consequence, high-quality primal solutions are often found only after significant cutting and branching or the use of primal heuristics. In this work, based on the ideas of pricing for integrality, we propose a new primal heuristic for vehicle routing problems.The heuristic is designed to generate columns that are more likely to be part of high-quality integer solutions. It begins by constructing a partial integer solution from a given column pool and then iteratively searches for columns that complement this solution. The search is done by modifying the pricing problem with respect to the partial solution, linear program dual information as well as previously generated columns in the heuristic. Computational tests are performed on the electrical vehicle routing problem with time windows extended with charging time slots, a problem that has both scheduling and routing aspects, making it well-suited to evaluate the performance of the proposed heuristic. The results show that the proposed heuristic closes 30% - 40% of the root node gap on average in comparison to a restricted master heuristic.",

    "abstract": "Distributed zeroth-order optimization is increasingly applied in heterogeneous scenarios where agents possess distinct data distributions and objectives. This heterogeneity poses fundamental challenges for convergence analysis, as existing convergence analyses rely on relatively strong assumptions to ensure theoretical guarantees. Specifically, at least one of the following three assumptions is usually required: (i) data homogeneity across agents, (ii) $\\mathcal{O}(pn)$ function evaluations per iteration with $p$ denoting the dimension and $n$ the number of agents, or (iii) the Polyak--\u0141ojasiewicz (P--L) or strong convexity condition with a known corresponding constant. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Heterogeneous Distributed Zeroth-Order Compressed (HEDZOC) algorithm, which is based on a two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and a general class of compressors. Without assuming data homogeneity, we develop the analysis covering three settings: general nonconvex functions, functions satisfying the P--L condition without knowing the P--L constant, and those with a known constant. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed HEDZOC algorithm is the first distributed zeroth-order method that establishes convergence without relying on the above three assumptions. Moreover, it achieves linear speedup convergence rate, which is comparable to state-of-the-art results attainable under data homogeneity and exact communication assumptions. Finally, experiments on heterogeneous adversarial example generation validate the theoretical results.",

Moreover, we generalise work by Hambrook--\u0141aba and Chen from the linear setting to obtain Knapp-type examples for multilinear estimates; we obtain two necessary conditions: one in terms of the upper box dimension of the measures' supports, and another one in terms of their Fourier decay and a ball condition.

In this case, how to fully utilize the spatial resources by designing the transmit beamforming such that both sensing and communication can achieve satisfactory performance statistically is a difficult problem, which motivates the study in this paper. Moreover, we aim to reveal if it is desirable to have similar probability distributions for the target and user locations in terms of the ISAC performance. Firstly, based on only probability distribution information, we establish communication and sensing performance metrics via deriving the expected rate or posterior Cram\u00e9r-Rao bound (PCRB). Then, we formulate the transmit beamforming optimization problem to minimize the PCRB subject to the expected rate constraint, for which the optimal solution is derived. It is unveiled that the rank of the optimal transmit covariance matrix is upper bounded by the summation of MIMO communication channel matrices for all possible user locations. Furthermore, due to the need to cater to multiple target/user locations, we investigate whether dynamically employing different beamforming designs over different time slots improves the performance. It is proven that using a static beamforming strategy is sufficient for achieving the optimal performance. Numerical results validate our analysis, show that ISAC performance improves as the target/user location distributions become similar, and provide useful insights on the BS-user/-target association strategy.",

    "abstract": "We study online linear optimization with matrix variables constrained by the operator norm, a setting where the geometry renders designing data-dependent and efficient adaptive algorithms challenging. The best-known adaptive regret bounds are achieved by Shampoo-like methods, but they require solving a costly quadratic projection subproblem. To address this, we extend the gradient-based prediction scheme to adaptive matrix online learning and cast algorithm design as constructing a family of smoothed potentials for the nuclear norm. We define a notion of admissibility for such smoothings and prove any admissible smoothing yields a regret bound matching the best-known guarantees of one-sided Shampoo. We instantiate this framework with two efficient methods that avoid quadratic projections. The first is an adaptive Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FTPL) method using Gaussian stochastic smoothing. The second is Follow-the-Augmented-Matrix-Leader (FAML), which uses a deterministic hyperbolic smoothing in an augmented matrix space. By analyzing the admissibility of these smoothings, we show both methods admit closed-form updates and match one-sided Shampoo's regret up to a constant factor, while significantly reducing computational cost. Lastly, using the online-to-nonconvex conversion, we derive two matrix-based optimizers, Pion (from FTPL) and Leon (from FAML). We prove convergence guarantees for these methods in nonsmooth nonconvex settings, a guarantee that the popular Muon optimizer lacks.",

The mathematical landscape has changed substantially: single-paper authors have reduced from $43$ \\% to $32$ \\%, collaboration has intensified, more mathematicians have greater breadth of research areas, and the giant component of the co-authorship network has grown denser, with median Erd\u0151s number dropping from $5$ to $4$. The data reveals the profession as markedly more collaborative, particularly among younger generations, although the tail of high productivity has also grown more extreme.",

    "title": "Robust design optimization for a nonlinear system via Bayesian neural network enhanced polynomial dimensional decomposition",
    "abstract": "Uncertainties such as manufacturing tolerances cause performance variations in complex engineering systems, making robust design optimization (RDO) essential. However, simulation-based RDO faces high computational cost for statistical moment estimation, and strong nonlinearity limits the accuracy of conventional surrogate models. This study proposes a novel RDO method that integrates Bayesian neural networks (BNN) with polynomial dimensional decomposition (PDD). The method employs uncertainty-based active learning to enhance BNN surrogate accuracy and a multi-point single-step strategy that partitions the design space into dynamically adjusted subregions, within which PDD analytically estimates statistical moments from BNN predictions. Validation through a mathematical benchmark and an electric motor shape optimization demonstrates that the method converges to robust optimal solutions with significantly fewer function evaluations. In the ten-dimensional benchmark, the proposed method achieved a 99.97% mean reduction, while Gaussian process-based and Monte Carlo approaches failed to locate the global optimum. In the motor design problem, the method reduced cogging torque by 94.75% with only 6644 finite element evaluations, confirming its computational efficiency for high-dimensional, strongly nonlinear engineering problems.",

It replaces each vertex $i$ of $K$ with a finite number $n_i$ of its copies, and each simplex $\\{i_0,\\ldots,i_k\\}$ with $n_{i_0}n_{i_1}\\cdots n_{i_k}$ many copies so that the collection of vertex-copies is spanned by a simplex in the inflation if and only if their originals were spanned by a simplex in the original complex. The celebrated poset fiber theorem of Bj\u00f6rner, Wachs, and Welker describes the homotopy type of such inflation in terms of homotopy types of $K$ and its links. In the current paper, we introduce more general inflations over simplicial posets: we replace each simplex with an arbitrary finite set of copies. The way how these sets patch together is specified by a commutative diagram, or, equivalently, a sheaf on the corresponding finite topology. The generalized inflation can be understood as \u00e9tale space of such sheaf. We prove that, whenever this inflation sheaf is flabby, the poset fiber theorem still applies. We prove all results similar to those known for vertex inflations. We also cover the previous result of the first author about homotopy types of clique complexes of multigraphs.",

In the first lecture we introduce tropical polynomials, ideals, congruences, and how the connection with tropical geometry is made via congruences of bend relations. Tropical geometry and matroid theory are telling us that we should focus attention on a narrow slice of the world of tropical algebra, and this leads to the theory of tropical ideals (as developed by Maclagan and Rinc\u00f3n) and an abundance of interesting open questions. In the second lecture we examine the relationship between Berkovich analytification and tropicalization from the perspective of bend relations, giving a refinement of Payne's influential limit theorem. In the third lecture we set aside geometry and focus on tropicalization via bend relations as a construction in commutative and non-commutative algebra. Constructions such as symmetric algebras, exterior algebras, matrix algebras, and Clifford algebras can be tropicalized. In the case of exterior algebras, the resulting tropical notion beautifully completes the picture of the Pl\u00fccker embedding and gives a new perspective on the tropical Pl\u00fccker relations. For matrix algebras and Clifford algebras, Morita theory becomes an interesting topic.",

Quasiperiodic functions are the restriction of higher dimensional periodic functions along a certain (irrational) direction. In classical settings, for real-valued frequencies, this equation is generally not well-posed: existence of solutions in L 2 is not guaranteed and uniqueness in L $\\infty$ may fail. This is a well-known difficulty of Helmholtz equations, but it has never been addressed in the quasiperiodic case. We tackle this issue by using the limiting absorption principle, which consists in adding some imaginary part (also called absorption) to the frequency in order to make the equation well-posed in L 2 , and then defining the physically relevant solution by making the absorption tend to zero. In previous work, we introduced a definition of the solution of the equation with absorption based on Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) boundary conditions. This approach offers two key advantages: it facilitates the limiting process and has a direct numerical counterpart. In this work, we first explain why the DtN boundary conditions have to be replaced by Robin-to-Robin boundary conditions to make the absorption go to zero. We then prove, under technical assumptions on the frequency, that the limiting absorption principle holds and we propose a numerical method to compute the physical solution.",

To date, only the property of forward-flatness - a special case of difference-flatness - can be checked in a computationally efficient manner. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach for testing backward-flatness, which is another special case of difference-flatness, and for deriving a corresponding backward-flat output. Additionally, we discuss the relationship between the Jacobian matrices associated with the flat parameterization of backward- and forward-flat systems and illustrate our results by an academic example.",

Analytical expressions for the neural network derivatives with respect to the input variables are derived, enabling accurate and efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix required by LM. The proposed approach is tested on several benchmark problems, including the Burgers, Schr\u00f6dinger, Allen-Cahn, and three-dimensional Bratu equations. Numerical results demonstrate that LM significantly outperforms BFGS in terms of convergence speed, accuracy, and final loss values, even when using shallow network architectures with only two hidden layers.

This work proves that finite Prony series representation holds if and only if the arithmetic pole lattices of Gamma factors in the Mellin transform of the complex modulus align exactly with those of a trial kernel, with residues satisfying decoupled first-order recurrences along aligned sublattices. This maximal criterion classifies classical models (Maxwell, standard linear solid) as finitely representable and fractional models (power-law, Cole--Cole, Zener, Gaussian) as transcendentally representable via infinite Prony ladders, yielding a complete analytical pole-lattice taxonomy of viscoelastic material models.",

Specifically, the storage demand is reduced from O(MN) to O(MN_exp), and the computational complexity is lowered from O(MN^2) to O(MN N_exp), where M and N denote the numbers of spatial and temporal grid points, respectively, and N_exp is the number of exponential terms used in the SOE approximation. The unique solvability, stability and accuracy of the resulting scheme are rigorously analyzed. Several numerical results are presented to confirm the sharpness of the error analysis and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.",

Our main result shows that a normal matrix is unitarily diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial completely splits over the ring and the associated spectral projections have entries in the ring. Building on this characterization, we develop an algorithm for deciding the unitary diagonalizability of matrices over regular local rings of algebraic varieties. A central ingredient of the algorithm is a decision procedure for determining whether a polynomial splits over a formal power series ring; we establish this using techniques from prime decomposition and the relative smoothness of integral closures in ramification theory.",

However, the absence of periodicity in these systems poses significant challenges for obtaining the spectral information. In this paper, by embedding the system into higher dimensions together with introducing a regularization technique, we prove that the spectrum of the Schr\u00f6dinger operator for the incommensurate system can be approximated by the spectra of a family of regularized Schr\u00f6dinger operators, which are elliptic, retain periodicity, and enjoy favorable analytic and spectral properties. We also show the existence of Bloch-type solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the incommensurate system, which can be well approximated by the Bloch solutions to the equations associated with the regularized operators. Our analysis provides a theoretical support for understanding and computing the incommensurate systems.",

This paper proposes a two-stage near-ML decoding framework that applies to any linear block code. In the first stage, we run a low-complexity decoder to produce a candidate codeword and a cyclic redundancy check. When this stage succeeds, we terminate immediately. When it fails, we invoke a second-stage decoder, termed multipoint code-weight sphere decoding (MP-WSD). The central idea behind {MP-WSD} is to concentrate the ML search where it matters. We pre-compute a set of low-weight codewords and use them to generate structured local perturbations of the current estimate. Starting from the first-stage output, MP-WSD iteratively explores a small Euclidean sphere of candidate codewords formed by adding selected low-weight codewords, tightening the search region as better candidates are found. This design keeps the average complexity low: at high signal-to-noise ratio, the first stage succeeds with high probability and the second stage is rarely activated; when it is activated, the search remains localized. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder attains near-ML performance for short-blocklength, low-rate codes while maintaining low decoding latency.",

In a surprising discovery, we show that the $\\leq_{\\mathrm{LT}}$-order is in fact tightly controlled by the combinatorics of filters on $\u03c9$, raising deep questions about how combinatorial and computable complexity interact, both within this order and beyond it.\n  To make the connection precise, we introduce a game-theoretic (''gamified'') variant of the Kat\u011btov order on filters over $\u03c9$, which turns out to exhibit a striking mix of coarseness and subtlety. For one, it is strictly coarser than the classical Rudin-Keisler order and, when viewed dually on ideals, collapses all MAD families to a single equivalence class. On the other hand, the order also supports a rich internal structure, including an infinite strictly ascending chain of ideal classes, which we identify by way of a new separation technique.\n  From the computability-theoretic perspective, we show that a computable (and extended) variant of the gamified Kat\u011btov order is isomorphic to the original $\\leq_{\\mathrm{LT}}$-order. Moreover, our work brings into focus a new degree-spectrum invariant for filters $\\mathcal{F}$, $$\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\mathcal{F}):=\\{\\,[f\\colon\u03c9\\to\u03c9] \\mid f\\leq_{\\mathrm{LT}} \\mathcal{F} \\},$$\n  which is shown to always determine a proper initial segment of the Turing degrees. Extending this, given any $\u0394^1_1$ filter $\\mathcal{F}$, we show that $\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{T}}(\\mathcal{F})$ is precisely the class of hyperarithmetic degrees. This significantly generalises previous results obtained by van Oosten \\cite{vO14} and Kihara \\cite{Kih23}.\n  The proofs draw on ideas from general topology, descriptive set theory, and computability theory.",

We aim to see whether this equivalence should hold when $q$ is a root of unity. We begin by asking if there is a natural bijection between the sets of irreducible objects. In this note we make an observation that suggests this should be the case: we show that there is a natural bijection between irreducible objects in the Gaiotto category and in the category of representations of a supergroup $GL(M|N)$ in positive characteristic. The proof is based on the version of the Serganova's algorithm formulated by J. Brundan and J. Kujawa in arXiv:math/0210108.",

Exploiting prescribed zero patterns (including block-triangularity and sparse decompositions, conveniently encoded by a directed sparsity graph), we obtain explicit, computable bounds and, in favorable cases, formulas for $\u03b3_1$ by combining deterministic triangular controls with a suitable refinement of the Furstenberg--Kifer lemma for block-triangular products. The estimates apply both to tempered (possibly deterministic) sequences and to stationary ergodic random cocycles under standard integrability.

    "abstract": "We review the memoir \\emph{heorie der Parallellinien} by Johann Heinrich Lambert, written in 1766. Lambert, a victim of the prejudices of his time, conceived this memoir as an attempt to prove the so-called parallel postulate of Euclid's \\emph{Elements}, and consequently, the non-existence of the geometry that we now call hyperbolic geometry. In fact, by developing the foundations of a geometry obtained by replacing the parallel postulate with its negation while keeping Euclid's other postulates unchanged, Lambert was hoping to arrive at a contradiction. Of course, he failed in his endeavor, but these attempts at proving the parallel postulate implicitly contain, without Lambert having foreseen it, fundamental results of hyperbolic geometry, the discovery of which, by Lobachevsky, Bolyai and Gauss, was not to take place until the following century. Thus, Lambert's memoir (which he did not intend to publish but which was eventually published in 1895) constitutes one of the founding texts of non-Euclidean geometry. Spherical geometry is one of the three geometries of constant curvature, the other two being Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry. In this sense, along with hyperbolic geometry, spherical geometry constitutes one of the two non-Euclidean geometries. In fact, Lambert, like Lobachevsky and others after him, understood the deep relationships between the three geometries: Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic, in particular the formal and the more profound analogies between the trigonometric formulae, the properties of birectangular isosceles quadrilaterals and of trirectangular quadrilaterals, the monotonicity properties (which can be formulated in terms of convexity properties) which hold in opposite senses in spherical and hyperbolic geometry which at some points he calls a sphere of imaginary radius. It is for these reasons that we decided to include in this volume, dedicated to spherical geometry, a chapter on this important memoir by Lambert, trying to highlight its most important ideas. This paper will appear as a chapter in the book ``Spherical Geometry in the Eighteenth Century I: Euler, Lagrange and Lambert'', ed. R. Caddeo and A. Papadopoulos, Springer Nature Switzerland, 2026.",

    "title": "Hierarchical Subcode Ensemble Decoding of Polar Codes",
    "abstract": "Subcode-ensemble decoders improve iterative decoding by running multiple decoders in parallel over carefully chosen subcodes, increasing the likelihood that at least one decoder avoids the dominant trapping structures. Achieving strong diversity gains, however, requires constructing many subcodes that satisfy a linear covering property-yet existing approaches lack a systematic way to scale the ensemble size while preserving this property. This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP. Simulations confirm that HSCED delivers significant block-error-rate improvements over standard BP and conventional subcode-ensemble decoding under the same decoding-latency constraint.",

There has been an effort to prove Roberson's conjecture as it is believed that minor-closed classes play a special role in the context of homomorphism indistinguishability.\n  We show that this special role, if so, must be shared, by proving an analogue of Roberson's conjecture holds for a rich family of non-minor-closed classes.

In this work decoupled implicit-explicit formulations based on the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methodology are considered and compared to existing schemes from the literature.\n  For the fluid flow a standard continuous Galerkin approach is applied. An adaptive conforming grid is utilized to further draw computational focus on the interface regions, while coarser meshes are utilized around pure phases.

    "title": "Almost sure null bankruptcy of testing-by-betting strategies",
    "abstract": "The bounded mean betting procedure serves as a crucial interface between the domains of (1) sequential, anytime-valid statistical inference, and (2) online learning and portfolio selection algorithms. While recent work in both domains has established the exponential wealth growth of numerous betting strategies under any alternative distribution, the tightness of the inverted confidence sets, and the pathwise minimax regret bounds, little has been studied regarding the asymptotics of these strategies under the null hypothesis. Under the null, a strategy induces a wealth martingale converging to some random variable that can be zero (bankrupt) or non-zero (non-bankrupt, e.g. when it eventually stops betting). In this paper, we show the conceptually intuitive but technically nontrivial fact that these strategies (universal portfolio, Krichevsky-Trofimov, GRAPA, hedging, etc.) all go bankrupt with probability one, under any non-degenerate null distribution. Part of our analysis is based on the subtle almost sure divergence of various sums of $\\sum O_p(n^{-1})$ type, a result of independent interest. We also demonstrate the necessity of null bankruptcy by showing that non-bankrupt strategies are all improvable in some sense. Our results significantly deepen our understanding of these betting strategies as they qualify their behavior on \"almost all paths\", whereas previous results are usually on \"all paths\" (e.g. regret bounds) or \"most paths\" (e.g. concentration inequalities and confidence sets).",

By formulating quantum state evolution intrinsically on the projective Hilbert space, we penalize covariant accelerations to generate smooth trajectories in the form of Riemannian cubics, while incorporating state-dependent constraints through potential functions. A structure-preserving variational discretization enables receding-horizon implementation, and a Lyapunov-type stability result is established for the closed-loop system. The approach is illustrated on the Bloch sphere for a two-level quantum system, providing a viable pathway toward predictive feedback control of constrained quantum dynamics.",

Can two sets be made arbitrarily far apart by adjusting the almost complex structure within an appropriate class of complete almost complex structures? We find rigidity phenomena when the excised set is a symplectic hypersurface. These arise from certain open Gromov-Witten invariants. We contrast this with flexibility that often occurs when the excised set is coisotropic. We also briefly touch on the opposite question of obstructions to existence of a complete symplectic structure compatible with a given complex structure. For the notion of completeness we first consider the traditional notion of geometric boundedness. We then introduce a broader notion of normalized completeness, related to the notion of intermittent boundedness of \\cite{GromanFloerOpen}, which depends on $C^0$ properties and is a contractible condition. Finally we speculate about the relation to a Fukaya-categorical notion of completeness.",

While the detailed analysis of the cross-correlation measure of such a family is a challenging problem and lies beyond the scope of the present paper, the structure of the construction suggests that sequences generated by different polynomials will remain nearly orthogonal. Indeed, since each sequence is built from distinct Legendre symbol sequences with proven low correlation, their combinations are expected to maintain the same level of independence.",

Along the way, among other things, we study the behavior of derived algebras along schematic quasi-affine morphisms in derived geometry, and for example, classify derived algebras on the source as precisely those derived algebras on the target which receive a map from the pushforward of the structure sheaf of the source. We also indicate how to extend some of our results to (formal) classifying stacks of diagonalizable group schemes.

By treating the state equation in weak form based on the concept of maximal parabolic regularity, one can then show that the reduced objective is continuously differentiable w.r.t.\\ the switching points which allows to use gradient-based method like the proximal gradient method for its minimization. In order to apply the known convergence results of this method, the gradient of the reduced objective must be Lipschitz continuous, which requires additional assumptions on the data. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings, but also illustrate that such a method will in general not be able to solve the problem up to global optimality due to the non-convex nature of the switching-point-to-control map.",

For small m we show the classical but poorly understood Good-Toulmin estimator to be minimax optimal to within a factor 2 and resolve the open problem of constructing principled prediction intervals for it. For intermediate m we propose a new estimator which achieves the minimax error for linear estimators up to an explicit multiplicative constant. Our estimator vastly outperforms the standard Smoothed Good-Toulmin estimator in the worst case and performs substantially better on several real data sets, namely those with many rare species. For large m we show that a previously mentioned estimator which did not have known rate guarantees actually achieves a marginally better rate than subsequent work. We find that this marginal rate improvement translates to meaningfully better performance in practice. We show in all three regimes that the same methods also achieve the same rate on incidence data, without further independence assumptions, provided that the sets are of bounded size. We establish, by means of bounded size biased couplings, concentration for some natural functionals of sequences of i.i.d. discrete-set-valued random variables which may be of independent interest.",

In this approach, regimes are identified using a density--radius bifiltration combined with persistent homology, a well-established tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). This topological perspective provides a unifying view of regimes and, unlike traditional methods, does not require the number of regimes to be specified in advance.

In this formulation, vertices represent candidate codewords and edges connect pairs whose longest common subsequence (LCS) distance guarantees correction of up to $d$ deletions. A valid codebook corresponds to a clique in the resulting graph, and finding the largest codebook is equivalent to identifying a maximum clique. While MCP-based formulations for deletion-correcting codes have previously been explored, we demonstrate that applying Penalty-Guided Clique Search (PGCS), a lightweight stochastic clique-search heuristic inspired by Dynamic Local Search (DLS), consistently yields larger codebooks than existing graph-based heuristics, including minimum-degree and coloring methods, for block lengths $n = 8,9,\\dots,14$ and deletion parameters $d = 1,2,3$. In several finite-length regimes, the resulting codebooks match known optimal sizes and outperform classical constructions such as Helberg codes. For decoding under segmented reception, where codeword boundaries are known, we propose an optimized LCS-based decoder that exploits symbol-count filtering and early termination to substantially reduce the number of LCS evaluations while preserving exact decoding guarantees.

Assuming $p>1$, $s\\in(0,1)$, and $sp'>1$, solutions belong to $W^{1,q}_{\\mathrm{loc}}(\u03a9)$ for the optimal exponent $q=q(n,p,s,r)$. We obtain quantitative local gradient estimates involving nonlocal tail terms. The optimality of $q$ is confirmed by a counterexample.",

In particular, given a non-minimizing but stationary 0-homogeneous harmonic map $u_0$ to a closed hemisphere, we construct infinitely many different weak solutions to harmonic map flow starting from $u_0$, all of which satisfy the parabolic monotonicity formula. This answers a question of Struwe.",

    "abstract": "We consider a Stokes flow coupled with advective-diffusive transport in an evolving domain with boundary conditions allowing for inflow and outflow. The evolution of the domain is induced by the transport process, leading to a fully coupled problem. Our aim is to model the thermal control of blood flow in human skin. To this end, the model takes into account the temperature-dependent production of biochemical substances, the subsequent dilation and constriction of blood vessels, and the resulting changes in convective heat transfer. We prove existence and uniqueness of weak solutions using a fixed point method that allows us to treat the nonlinear coupling.",

    "title": "Convergence Analysis for the Recovery of the Friction Threshold in a Scalar Tresca Model",
    "abstract": "We consider a scalar valued elliptic partial differential equation on a sufficiently smooth domain $\u03a9$, subject to a regularized Tresca friction-type boundary condition on a subset $\u0393$ of $\\partial \u03a9$. The friction threshold, a positive function appearing in this boundary condition, is assumed to be unknown and serves as the coefficient to be recovered in our inverse problem. Assuming that (i) the friction threshold lies in a finite dimensional space with known basis functions, (ii) the right hand sides of the partial differential equation are known, and (iii) the solution to the partial differential equation on some small open subset $\u03c9\\subset \u03a9$ is available, we develop an iterative computational method for the recovery of the friction threshold. This algorithm is simple to implement and is based on piecewise linear finite elements. We show that the proposed algorithm converges in second order to a function $a_h$ and, moreover, that $a_h$ converges in second order in the finite element's mesh size $h$ to the true (unknown) friction threshold. We highlight our theoretical results by simulations that confirm our rates numerically.",

We next extend the Koszul duality between linear $\\infty$-operads and linear $\\infty$-cooperads from our previous paper (arXiv:2105.11943) to their categories of algebras and coalgebras. This duality theorem specialises to the known duality in the case of algebras over classical (non-infinity) operads, but our proof is different. In fact, it is based on a much more general duality between presheaves and copresheaves on a category of trees. The latter duality is a priori independent of the (co)algebra structures, but we show that it can be lifted to (co)presheaves supporting such a structure. Based on this duality, we define the homology of an algebra over an $\\infty$-operad, and prove that it can be described in terms of the homology of the same category of trees with coefficients in a presheaf.",
