    "abstract": "We consider an elliptic partial differential equation in non-divergence form with a random diffusion matrix and random forcing term. To address this, we propose a mixed-type continuous finite element discretization in the physical domain, combined with a collocation discretization in the stochastic domain. For the mixed formulation, we first introduce a stochastic cost functional at the continuous level. This formulation is then enhanced to incorporate the vanishing tangential trace constraint directly into a mesh-dependent cost functional, rather than enforcing it in the solution's function space. In this context, we define a mesh-dependent norm and provide an error analysis based on this norm. We employ the collocation method by collocating the stochastic equation at the zeros of suitable tensor product orthogonal polynomials. This approach leads to a system of uncoupled deterministic problems, simplifying computation. Furthermore, we establish an a poriori error bound for the fully discrete approximation, detailing the convergence rates with respect to the discretization parameters. Finally, numerical results are presented to confirm and validate the theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "Multi-stage decision problems under uncertainty can be efficiently solved with the Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP) algorithm. However, traditional implementations require all stage problems to be feasible. Feasibility is usually enforced by adding slack variables and penalizing them in the objective function, a process that depends on case-specific calibration and often distorts the economic interpretation of results. This paper proposes the Penalty-Free SDDP, an extension that introduces a Future Feasibility Function alongside the traditional Future Cost Function. The new recursion handles infeasibilities automatically, distinguishing between temporary and truly infeasible cases, and propagates feasibility information across stages through dedicated feasibility cuts. The approach was validated in a large-scale deterministic case inspired by the Brazilian hydrothermal system, achieving equivalent feasibility to the benchmark solution while eliminating miscalibrated artificial penalties. Results confirm its robustness and practicality as a foundation for future stochastic, multi-stage applications.",

We formulate this learning task as a convex optimization problem using decision-focused learning techniques and solve it by differentiating through the higher and the lower level problems in our architecture. To ensure robustness, we derive out-of-sample performance guarantees using conformal prediction. Numerical experiments in facility location, knapsack problems, and vehicle routing problems demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces computation time while maintaining feasibility and high solution quality compared to state-of-the-art solvers.",

By applying the matrix maximum principle, a set of decentralized feedback strategies is constructed.

    "title": "Market share maximizing strategies of CAV fleet operators may cause chaos in our cities",
    "abstract": "We study the dynamics and equilibria of a new kind of routing games, where players - drivers of future autonomous vehicles - may switch between individual (HDV) and collective (CAV) routing. In individual routing, just like today, drivers select routes minimizing expected travel costs, whereas in collective routing an operator centrally assigns vehicles to routes. The utility is then the average experienced travel time discounted with individually perceived attractiveness of automated driving. The market share maximising strategy amounts to offering utility greater than for individual routing to as many drivers as possible. Our theoretical contribution consists in developing a rigorous mathematical framework of individualized collective routing and studying algorithms which fleets of CAVs may use for their market-share optimization. We also define bi-level CAV - HDV equilibria and derive conditions which link the potential marketing behaviour of CAVs to the behavioural profile of the human population. Practically, we find that the fleet operator may often be able to equilibrate at full market share by simply mimicking the choices HDVs would make. In more realistic heterogenous human population settings, however, we discover that the market-share maximizing fleet controller should use highly variable mixed strategies as a means to attract or retain customers. The reason is that in mixed routing the powerful group player can control which vehicles are routed via congested and uncongested alternatives. The congestion pattern generated by CAVs is, however, not known to HDVs before departure and so HDVs cannot select faster routes and face huge uncertainty whichever alternative they choose. Consequently, mixed market-share maximising fleet strategies resulting in unpredictable day-to-day driving conditions may, alarmingly, become pervasive in our future cities.",

This adaptive approach facilitates the conveyance of extra bits to the receiver, which means it needs less cost of radio-frequency chains at transmitter while improving SE. Besides, the proposed schemes offer an inherent PLS security advantage, as the eavesdropper is unable to completely detect signals reflected from the RIS. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of the proposed RASM and RASSK schemes, this paper presents a detailed analytical performance of their spectral efficiency, detection complexity, bit error rate, and secrecy rate, which are accompanied by insightful findings and conclusions. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed schemes, showcasing their improved error performance and robustness against wiretapping, while also highlighting the potential of the RASM and RASSK schemes for future wireless applications.",

The proposed integrator is compared with the implicit midpoint variational integrator on two examples of systems with inseparable Hamiltonians. First, the example of the nonlinear double pendulum illustrates how the method can be applied to multibody systems. The analytical solution of the Lagrange top is then used as a reference to analyze accuracy, convergence, and precision of the numerical method.

    "abstract": "The distribution of prime constellations, such as Twin Primes ($p, p+2$), is traditionally analyzed via probabilistic models or analytic sieve theory. While heuristic predictions are accurate, rigorous proofs are obstructed by the \"Parity Barrier\", which prevents classical sieves from distinguishing primes from semi-primes in the asymptotic limit. In this work, we present a structural proof of existence based on deterministic signal processing. We treat the sequence of integers as a signal generated by a rigid Diophantine basis ($N=2n+3m$) and define a fundamental certification window $\\mathcal{W} = [P, m_0^2)$ derived from the basis limit $m_0$. We demonstrate that the non-existence of constellations (the \"Null Hypothesis\") constitutes a low-entropy signal state, a \"Prime Desert\", that requires infinite spectral resolution to maintain over a quadratic window. Since the sieving basis is finite ($p \\le m_0$), the system is band-limited and structurally incapable of synthesizing the destructive interference required to sustain a zero count. By invoking the Chinese Remainder Theorem and analyzing the detailed correlation structure of residue classes, we prove that positive and negative correlations between sieved positions cancel at leading order, constraining the variance of the signal to scale linearly with the mean ($O(\u03bc)$) rather than the quadratic scaling ($\u03a9(\u03bc^2)$) required to support a Prime Desert. This Variance Gap implies that the signal must strictly oscillate around its mean, rendering the existence of prime constellations a mandatory consequence of the system's finite spectral bandwidth.",

    "abstract": "Electron devices based on graphene have lately received a considerable interest; in fact, they could represent the ultimate miniaturization, since the active area is only one atom tick. However, the gapless dispersion relation of graphene at the Dirac points limits the possibility of using pristine graphene instead of traditional semiconductors in Field Effect Transistors (FET). For such a reason very accurate simulations are needed.\n  In Nastasi & Romano, IEEE TED (2021) a graphene field effect transistor (GFET) has been proposed and simulated adopting a drift-diffusion model. Here, electron devices whose active area is made of monolayer graphene are simulated adopting as mathematical model the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equations (BTEs) in the bipolar case, coupled with the Poisson equation for the electric field. The system is solved by means of a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach (see Cockburn & Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (1998); Hesthaven & Warburton, 2008) with linear elements in the spatial coordinate and constant approximation for the wave-vector space, discretized with a polar mesh. The correct physical range for the distribution function is preserved with the maximum-principle-satisfying scheme introduced in Zhang & Shu, J. Comp. Phys. (2010).\n  The adopted method reveals very robust and possesses a good degree of accuracy, making it particularly well suited for capturing the complex charge transport dynamics inherent to graphene-based devices. The results for suspended monolayer graphene and GFET constitute benchmark solutions for a rigorous assessment of the validity of macroscopic models, such as drift-diffusion and hydrodynamic ones.",

We establish a Generalized Inflation Theorem, demonstrating that for central polynomials, the root set forms a homogeneous space $G/H$, where $G$ is the automorphism group of the algebra ($SO(3)$ for $\\mathbb{H}$, $G_2$ for $\\mathbb{O}$). This mechanism generates continuous geometry from non-commutativity. We analyze the dynamics under central modulation (breathing modes), classifying topological bifurcations ($\u0394=0$). We then analyze the topological collapse induced by non-central perturbations, governed by symmetry reduction. We utilize the Localization Theorem (Gordon-Motzkin) to explain the alignment of roots with coefficient subalgebras. We formalize the dynamics of collapse using gradient flow on the potential landscape $\\mathcal{V}(x) = \\|P(x)\\|^2$, characterizing it as a deformation retract and proving that the collapse timescale exhibits critical slowing down with quadratic scaling ($T_{\\rm collapse} \\propto \u03b5^{-2}$).

    "abstract": "The Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) is essential for initial access and synchronization in both 5G and future 6G networks; however, its detection is highly sensitive to impairments such as high user density, large carrier frequency offset (CFO), and fast fading. Although prior studies have examined PRACH detection, they are often restricted to specific scenarios or lack a comprehensive analytical characterization of performance. We introduce a unified analytical framework that characterizes the statistical distribution of the received power delay profile (PDP) under flat Rayleigh fading and supports both coherent combining (CC) and power combining (PC) repetition strategies. For each strategy, we derive optimal threshold expressions and closed-form detection probabilities. Furthermore, we analyze two key cases depending on the coherence time: identical and independent channel realizations per repetition. Secondly, we exploit the correlation induced by CFO across cyclic shifts to design a novel low-complexity detector that exploits PDP dependencies. Numerical results indicate that PC outperforms CC when repetitions experience independent channels, while CC can be preferable under identical realizations in limited settings. On the other hand, the proposed CFO-aware detector delivers improved robustness under severe CFO conditions.",

In 2021, Glock, K\u00fchn, and Osthus proposed a generalization of this result. Namely they conjectured a hypergraph version of Nash-Williams' Conjecture positing that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ on $n$ vertices has minimum $(r-1)$-degree (denoted $\u03b4(G)$ hereafter) at least $\\left(1-\u0398_r\\left(\\frac{1}{q^{r-1}}\\right)\\right) \\cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition.\n  The best known progress on this conjecture dates to the second proof of the Existence Conjecture by Glock, K\u00fchn, Lo, and Osthus wherein they showed that $\u03b4(G)\\ge \\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{2r}}\\right)\\cdot n$ suffices for large enough $n$, where $c$ is a constant depending on $r$ but not $q$. As for the fractional relaxation, the best known bound is due to Delcourt, Lesgourgues, and the second author, who proved that $\u03b4(G)\\ge \\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\\right)\\cdot n$ guarantees a $K_q^r$-fractional decomposition.\n  We prove that for every integer $r\\ge 2$, there exists a real $c>0$ such that if a $K_q^r$-divisible $r$-graph $G$ satisfies $\u03b4(G)\\ge \\max\\left\\{ \u03b4_{K_q^r}^* + \\varepsilon,~~1 -\\frac{c}{\\binom{q}{r-1}} \\right\\} \\cdot n$, then $G$ admits a $K_q^r$-decomposition for all large enough $n$, where $\u03b4_{K_q^r}^*$ denotes the fractional $K_q^r$-decomposition threshold. Combined with the fractional result above, this proves that $\\left(1-\\frac{c}{q^{r-1 + o(1)}}\\right)\\cdot n$ suffices for the Hypergraph Nash-Williams' Conjecture, approximately confirming the correct order of $q$. Our proof uses the newly developed method of refined absorption; we also develop a non-uniform Tur\u00e1n theory to prove the existence of many embeddings of absorbers which may be of independent interest.",

The unbounded lower-order terms are allowed to lie in mixed time-space Lebesgue or even Lorentz spaces. Our notion of weak solutions is formulated under minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution, which coincides with the associated evolution family for the homogeneous problem (i.e., with zero source term) and provides a representation formula for all weak solutions. We also establish $L^2$ off-diagonal estimates for the fundamental solution and derive Gaussian upper bounds under the weak assumption of Moser's $L^2$-$L^\\infty$ estimates for weak solutions. Our approach is purely variational and avoids any a priori regularity assumptions on weak solutions or regularization via smooth approximations. Two key ingredients are norm inequalities for fractional powers of the degenerate Laplacian, and a set of embeddings that ensure time continuity of weak solutions, extending the classical Lions regularity theorem and accommodating a wide class of source terms.",

The developed optimal control problem simultaneously minimizes three elements. First, the control effort is reduced to avoid aggressive inputs and second, the network induced error caused by time delays and packet dropouts. Third, the topology-induced error, as the distributed graph restricts agents access to global information. This error is inherent to the communication graph and cannot be addressed through offline learning. To overcome this, the study also introduces the incremental Expectation Maximization EM algorithm, enabling online learning of the SCHMM.

    "abstract": "In this paper we study the arithmetic invariants of Euclidean lattice in the context of Arakelov geometry. We regard a Euclidean lattice as a hermitian vector bundle $\\bar E$ on ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$ and consider two typical arithmetic analogues of the dimension of the space of global sections of a vector bundle on an algebraic curve. One is $$h^0_{\\rm Ar}(\\bar E):=\\log \\vert E\\cap B_1 \\vert$$ where $B_1$ is the unit ball, and the other is $$h^0_\u03b8(\\bar{E}):=\\log\\sum_{v\\in E}e^{-\u03c0\\Vert v\\Vert^2}$$ where $\\sum_{v\\in E}e^{-\u03c0\\Vert v\\Vert^2}$ is the theta function of $\\bar E$. In this paper, we shall prove the following three statements: (i) the fact that one can not reach an absolute Riemann-Roch theorem for $h^0_{\\rm Ar}(\\bar E)$ is an instance of the Heissenberg uncertainty principle; (ii) the finiteness of equivalence classes in the genus of a positive quadratic form defined over $\\mathbb{Z}$ is equivalent to the finiteness of certain isometry classes of hermitian vector bundles on ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$, and it can be deduced from a finiteness theorem in Arakelov theory of ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$; (iii) for any smooth function $f$ on $\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ such that $f>0$ and that $f\\circ {\\rm exp}$ is a Schwartz function on $\\mathbb{R}$, the Mellin transform of $f$ can be written as an integral over the Arakelov divisor class group of ${\\rm Spec}(\\mathbb{Z})$.",

The SIPF-PIC method integrates Lagrangian particle dynamics with spectral field solvers, by leveraging localized particle-grid interpolations and fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques. For $P$ particles and $H$ Fourier modes per spatial dimension, the SIPF-PIC method achieves a computational complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(P + H^3 \\log H)$ per time step, a significant improvement over the original SIPF method (proposed in \\cite{SIPF1}), which has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(PH^3)$, while preserving numerical accuracy. Moreover, we establish a rigorous error analysis, proving that the discretization errors are of order $\\mathcal{O}(H^{-16/13}+P^{-1/2}H^{4/13})$. Finally, we present numerical experiments to validate the theoretical convergence rates and demonstrate the computational efficiency of our new method. Notably, these experiments also show that the method captures complex blowup dynamics beyond single-point collapse, including ring-type singularities, where mass dynamically concentrates into evolving annular structures.",

    "abstract": "Restriction categories provide a categorical framework for partiality. In this paper, we introduce three new categorical theories for partiality: local categories, partial categories, and inclusion categories. The objects of a local category are partially accessible resources, and morphisms are processes between these resources. In a partial category, partiality is addressed via two operators, restriction and contraction, which control the domain of definition of a morphism. Finally, an inclusion category is a category equipped with a family of monics which axiomatize the inclusions between sets. The main result of this paper shows that restriction categories are $2$-equivalent to local categories, that partial categories are $2$-equivalent to inclusion categories, and that both restriction/local categories are $2$-equivalent to bounded partial/inclusion categories. Our result offers four equivalent ways to describe partiality: on morphisms, via restriction categories; on objects, with local categories; operationally, with partial categories; and via inclusions, with inclusion categories. We also translate several key concepts from restriction category theory to the local category context, which allows us to show that various special kinds of restriction categories, such as inverse categories, are $2$-equivalent to their analogous kind of local categories. In particular, the equivalence between inverse (restriction) categories and inverse local categories is a generalization of the celebrated Ehresmann-Schein-Nambooripad theorem for inverse semigroups.",

    "abstract": "In large-scale AI training, Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (s-MoE) layers enable scaling by activating only a small subset of experts per token. An operational challenge in this design is load balancing: routing tokens to minimize the number of idle experts, which is important for the efficient utilization of (costly) GPUs. We provide a theoretical framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) procedure -- proposed by DeepSeek's Wang et al. (2024) -- by casting it as a one-step-per-iteration primal-dual method for an assignment problem. First, in a stylized deterministic setting, our framework yields several insightful structural properties: (i) a monotonic improvement of a Lagrangian objective, (ii) a preference rule that moves tokens from overloaded to underloaded experts, and (iii) an approximate-balancing guarantee. Then, we incorporate the stochastic and dynamic nature of AI training using a generalized online optimization formulation. In the online setting, we derive a strong convexity property of the objective that leads to a logarithmic expected regret bound under certain step-size choices. Additionally, we present real experiments on 1B-parameter DeepSeekMoE models to complement our theoretical findings. Together, these results build a principled framework for analyzing the Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing of s-MoE in AI models.",

    "abstract": "We propose a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for a broad class of unconstrained controlled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and establish its mean-square exponential stability in the infinite-horizon limit. At each prediction step of the MPC iteration, the nonlinear controlled SDE is approximated by its linearization at the origin, with the sampled state of the nonlinear system as initial condition, yielding a finite-horizon stochastic linear-quadratic (SLQ) optimal control problem. The resulting optimal control is then applied to the original nonlinear stochastic dynamics until the next sampling instant. This construction leads to a delayed SMPC scheme whose closed-loop behavior is governed by a coupled time-delay SDE system, a setting that has not been analyzed before. We prove global mean-square exponential stability for linear and mildly nonlinear SDEs by exploiting the exponential convergence of the Riccati equation to the algebraic Riccati equation (ARE). For strongly nonlinear SDEs, we establish local mean-square exponential stability by combining exponential Riccati convergence with stopping-time techniques and Gr\u00f6nwall-type estimates. It is observed that, to ensure the desired local stability properties, the nonlinearities of the SDE are allowed to have polynomial growth but not exponential growth, distinguishing SMPC from its deterministic counterpart.\n  These results provide the first rigorous mean-square stability guarantees for SMPC of SDE systems with delayed state information, thereby advancing the theoretical foundations of stochastic predictive control.",

We show that 100\\% of polynomials (in an $L^k$ sense for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$) satisfy the Bateman--Horn Conjecture, and that that 100\\% of polynomials (in an $L^2$ sense) satisfy an appropriate polynomial analogue of the Hardy--Littlewood Prime Tuples Conjecture. We use the latter to prove that 100\\% of polynomials satisfy the appropriate analogue of the Poisson Tail Conjecture, in the sense that the distribution of the gaps between consecutive prime values around the average spacing is Poisson.\n  We also study the frequencies of sign patterns of the Liouville function evaluated at the consecutive outputs of $f$; viewing $f$ as a random variable, we establish the limiting distribution for every sign pattern. The Chowla problem along random polynomials is a special case. A key input behind all of our arguments is Leng's recent quantitative work on the higher-order Fourier uniformity of the von Mangoldt and M\u00f6bius functions (in turn relying on Leng, Sah, and Sawhney's quantitative inverse theorem for the Gowers norms).",

In particular, we assume an information source observing a discrete-time finite-state Markov chain (DTMC) and employing push-based transmissions of status update packets towards the monitor which is tasked with remote estimation of the source. The source-to-monitor channel delay is assumed to have a general discrete-time phase-type (DPH) distribution, whereas the zero-delay reverse channel ensures that the source has perfect information on AoII and the remote estimate. A multi-threshold transmission policy is employed where packet transmissions are initiated when the AoII process exceeds a threshold which may be different for each estimation value. In this general setting, our goal is to minimize the weighted sum of time average of an arbitrary function of AoII and estimation, and transmission costs, by suitable choice of the thresholds. We formulate the problem as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) with the same state-space as the original DTMC to obtain the optimum multi-threshold policy whereas the parameters of the SMDP are obtained by using a novel stochastic tool called dual-regime absorbing Markov chain (DR-AMC), and its corresponding absorption time distribution named as dual-regime DPH (DR-DPH).",

This decomposition enables both the forward application and the backward inversion to be accomplished with quasi-linear complexity.

    "abstract": "Inverse imaging problems rely on limited and indirect measurements, making reconstruction highly dependent on both regularization and sample locations. We introduce a novel greedy framework for the optimal selection of indirect measurements in the operator codomain, specifically tailored to inverse problems. Our approach employs a two-step scheme combining kernel-based interpolation and extrapolation. Within this framework, greedy schemes can be residual-based, where points are selected according to the current approximation error for a specific target function, or error-based, where points are chosen using a priori error indicators independent of the residual. For the latter, we derive explicit error bounds that quantify the propagation of approximation errors through both interpolation and extrapolation. Numerical applications to solar hard X-ray imaging demonstrate that the proposed greedy sampling strategy achieves high-quality reconstructions using only a few available measurements.",

A long-standing question in the theory of Markov numbers is Frobenius's unicity conjecture, concerning whether every Markov number is the maximum in a unique solution triple.

    "abstract": "We establish a right-exactness theorem for the cross-effects of bifunctors, and consequently for cosmash products, in Janelidze-M\u00e1rki-Tholen semi-abelian categories. This result motivates an intrinsic definition of a bilinear product, a tensor-like operation on objects of a category, constructed in terms of limits and colimits. Given two objects in the category, their bilinear product is the abelian object obtained as the cosmash product in the category of two-nilpotent objects of the reflections of these objects. In many concrete cases, this operation, applied to a pair of abelian objects, captures a classical tensor product. We explain this by proving a recognition theorem, which states that any symmetric, bi-cocontinuous bifunctor on an abelian variety of algebras can be recovered as the bilinear product within a suitable semi-abelian variety, namely of algebras over a certain two-nilpotent operad. In other words, the extra structure carried by such a bifunctor on the abelian variety (for instance, a tensor product, known in the literature) is encoded by means of a surrounding semi-abelian variety whose abelian core is the original variety.\n  We illustrate the construction with several examples, develop its basic properties, and compare it to the semi-abelian analogue of the Brown-Loday non-abelian tensor product. As an application, we present a categorical version of Ganea's six-term exact homology sequence. Finally, we characterise abelian extensions via internal action cores, yielding explicit descriptions of cosmash products and bilinear products in certain categories of representations.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale problems in data science are often modeled with optimization, and the optimization model is usually solved with first-order methods that may converge at a sublinear rate. Therefore, it is of interest to terminate the optimization algorithm as soon as the underlying data science task is accomplished. We consider FISTA for solving two binary classification problems: the ellipsoid separation problem (ESP), and the soft-margin support-vector machine (SVM). For the ESP, we cast the dual second-order cone program into a form amenable to FISTA and show that the FISTA residual converges to the infimal displacement vector of the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm, that directly encodes a separating hyperplane. We further derive a data-dependent iteration upper bound scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(1/\u03b4_{\\mathcal{A}}^2)$, where $\u03b4_{\\mathcal{A}}$ is the minimal perturbation that destroys separability. For the SVM, we propose a strongly-concave perturbed dual that admits efficient FISTA updates under a linear time projection scheme, and with our parameter choices, the objective has small condition number, enabling rapid convergence. We prove that, under a reasonable data model, early-stopped iterates identify well-classified points and yield a hyperplane that exactly separates them, where the accuracy required of the dual iterate is governed by geometric properties of the data. In particular, the proposed early-stopping criteria diminish the need for hard-to-select tolerance-based stopping conditions. Our numerical experiments on ESP instances derived from MNIST data and on soft-margin SVM benchmarks indicate competitive runtimes and substantial speedups from stopping early.",

By applying the Lyapunov method, we establish the existence of spatially inhomogeneous steady states when a parameter approaches the principal eigenvalue of a non-self-adjoint elliptic operator. A detailed analysis of the characteristic equation further confirms the existence of Hopf bifurcations originating from these steady states. Subsequently, by applying center manifold reduction and normal form theory, we ascertain the direction of these Hopf bifurcations and the stability of the resulting periodic orbits. Finally, the proposed general theoretical results are successfully applied to a \"food-limited\" population model and a weak Allee effect-driven population model, each of which incorporates diffusion, time delay, and advection, thus confirming the validity of our approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes a semi-implicit arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method for the solution of the unified Godunov-Peshkov-Romenski (GPR) model of continuum mechanics. To handle the curl free involutions arising in the solid limit of the model, the original system is augmented by adopting a thermodynamically compatible generalized Lagrangian multiplier (GLM) approach. Next, an operator splitting strategy decouples the computation of fast pressure waves from the bulk velocity of the medium yielding a transport subsystem, containing convective terms and non-conservative products, and a Poisson-type subsystem, for the pressure. A second splitting yields an ODE subsystem comprising only the potentially stiff source terms, responsible for the relaxation of the model between its fluid and solid limits.\n  The mesh motion can be driven by two sources: the local fluid velocity and a prescribed boundary displacement. For the spatial discretization, we employ unstructured staggered grids, with the pressure defined on the primal mesh and all remaining variables on the dual grid. The transport subsystem is advanced via an explicit finite volume method, in which integration over closed space-time control volumes ensures verification of the geometric conservation law (GCL). On the other hand, implicit continuous finite elements are used for the discretization of the pressure subsystem and an implicit DIRK scheme is employed to solve the ODE subsystem. Consequently, the proposed approach is well suited to address all Mach number flows. A comprehensive set of benchmarks is employed to assess the accuracy and robustness of the proposed methodology in tackling both fluid and solid mechanics problems.",

Each producer optimally adjusts both output and capacity over time in response to endogenous price signals, while investment decisions are irreversible. Market clearing holds continuously, with prices evolving endogenously to balance aggregate supply and demand through a constant-elasticity demand function driven by a stochastic base component. The model admits a mean-field interpretation, as each producer's decisions both influence and are influenced by the aggregate behaviour of all others. We show that the equilibrium price process can be expressed as a nonlinear functional of the exogenous base demand, leading to a three-dimensional singular stochastic control problem for each producer. We derive an explicit solution to the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, including a closed-form characterisation of the free-boundary surface separating investment and waiting regions.",

This presents an efficient large deformation, elasto-plastic Material Point Method-based soil-structure interaction predictive tool for the estimation of anchor penetration based on Cone Penetration Test (CPT) site investigation data. The tool builds on earlier work by the authors supplemented by three developments: modelling assemblies of rigid bodies (necessary for articulated anchors), a partitioned domain approach to enable accurate and efficient modelling of long anchor pulls and an improved means of modelling rotational inertia. The tool is validated against scaled physical tests conducted in a geotechnical centrifuge on sands with a range of relative densities with good agreement across the tested conditions. Numerical simulations identify key issues with the UK Cable Burial Risk Assessment (CBRA) approach for estimating anchor penetration and reveal the potentially non-conservatism of the CBRA framework for sandy seabeds. The numerical model enables site-specific anchor-penetration assessment along cable routes and can be used to evaluate the performance of different anchor designs and sizes in varied soil conditions.",

By deriving first-order sensitivity relations of second-order cone programming solutions with respect to problem data, exact gradients of trajectory performance metrics with respect to arbitrary parameters are obtained and propagated through iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through three representative applications: optimal terminal-time prediction for powered landing, trust-region penalty optimization in subproblems, and surface-to-mass ratio optimization for hypersonic gliding vehicles. Simulation results show that the proposed framework enables reliable gradient-based parameter learning and significantly improves numerical performance, convergence behavior, and design efficiency.

This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves.",

    "abstract": "We investigate quantum Markov semigroups on bosonic Fock space and identify a broad class of infinite-dimensional dissipative evolutions that exhibit instantaneous Sobolev-regularization. Motivated by stability problems in quantum computation, we show that for certain Lindblad operators that are polynomials of creation and annihilation operators, the resulting dynamics immediately transform any initial state into one with finite expectation in all powers of the number operator. A key application is in the bosonic cat code, where we obtain explicit estimates in the trace norm for the speed of convergence. These estimates sharpen existing perturbative bounds at both short and long times, offering new analytic tools for assessing stability and error suppression in bosonic quantum information processing. For example, we improve the strong exponential convergence of the (shifted) $2$-photon dissipation to its fixed point to the uniform topology.",

In this paper, we provide a stochastic analytic proof of the formula for the invariant measures. Our approach starts from the Gaussian invariant measure for the case of homogeneous boundary conditions. We approximate the inhomogeneous problem by a homogeneous one with a singular boundary potential. Using tools including change of measure, time reversal for Markov processes, and It\u00f4's formula, we then reduce the problem to analyzing the KPZ nonlinearity in a thin boundary layer. Finally, using the theory of regularity structures, we establish a central limit theorem for the time-integrated nonlinearity near the boundary, which completes the proof of the invariance. Although it is known that different boundary parameters give rise to distinct physical regimes for the invariant measures, our method is robust and does not rely on any particular choice of boundary parameters.",

Derived from the finite volume method, the transmissibility matrices rather than permeability is adopted as the inputs of surrogates to enhance the prediction accuracy further. To increase sampling efficiency, a generative latent space adaptive sampling method is developed employing the Gaussian mixture model for density estimation of generalization error. Validation is conducted on test cases of 2D/3D single- and two-phase Darcy flow field prediction. Results reveal consistent enhancement in prediction accuracy given limited training set.",

We describe vertical collision orbits and families emerging from its pitchfork, period-doubling, and period-tripling bifurcations in the limiting Hill's problem, including the halo and butterfly families. We continue these into the CR3BP using a perturbative framework via a symplectic scaling, and construct bifurcation graphs for representative systems (Saturn-Enceladus, Earth-Moon, Copenhagen) to identify common dynamical features.

    "abstract": "As a key circular economy strategy, remanufacturing allows original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to reduce waste by restoring used products to ``as-new'' conditions. This paper investigates an OEM's optimal remanufacturing business model by incorporating consumer perceptions into price and production quantity decisions. We analyze three alternative models: no remanufacturing, OEM in-house remanufacturing, and third-party remanufacturer (TPR) authorized remanufacturing. We extend the authorization with a two-part tariff contract and consider a stochastic market size. Through a numerical approach, we optimize price and quantity decisions based on consumer perceptions and develop a hierarchical decision roadmap to guide model selection. Our findings show that when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is high, OEM in-house remanufacturing is most profitable and reduces environmental impacts, but generally leads to a market dominated by remanufactured products. In contrast, when consumer's perceived value of remanufactured products is moderate and TPR remanufacturing significantly increases the perceived value of new products, the TPR-authorized remanufacturing is most profitable. It typically boosts total market sales, but accordingly increases environmental impacts. In addition, sensitivity analysis indicates that two-part authorization contracts are more advanced in meeting stringent environmental requirements than one-part contracts. Incorporating market size stochasticity enhances system profitability while keeping environmental impacts within a limited scope.",

While existing optimal control methods for these systems focus on minimizing average performance, this risk-neutral perspective may allow rare but highly undesirable system behaviors. To account for such events, we instead minimize the cost within a coherent risk measure. Our approach reformulates the coupled dynamics as a stochastic PDE, approximates it by a finite-dimensional SDE system, and applies a gradient-based method to compute a riskaverse feedback controller. Numerical simulations show that the proposed controller substantially reduces the tail of the cost distribution, improving reliability with only a minor reduction in average performance.",

The system has a capacity of one packet, i.e., no waiting buffer, and is modeled as a multi-source M/G/1/1 queueing system. We introduce a probabilistically preemptive packet management policy, under which an existing packet from the same source in the system is replaced by an arriving packet with a fixed probability.

This paper investigates finite generation of the skew subfield $M^G$ of $G$-invariants in $M$, and relations between the generators. The first main result shows that $M^G$ is finitely generated. Stronger conclusions hold when $M$ is a free skew field, i.e., the universal skew field of fractions of a free algebra. The second main result is the solution of the free Noether problem for non-modular linear group actions: if $G$ acts linearly on the free skew field $M$ on $m$ generators and the characteristic of $k$ does not divide $|G|$, then $M^G$ is the free skew field on $|G|(m-1)+1$ generators. In contrast, a nonlinear action of $Z_2$ on the free skew field $M$ on two generators is presented such that $M^{Z_2}$ is not a free skew field, resolving the free L\u00fcroth problem. This action also exposes a non-scalar element of $M$ whose centralizer is not a rational field, refuting a conjecture of P. M. Cohn from 1978.",

    "abstract": "An insider is defined as a team member who covertly deviates from the team's optimal collaborative control strategy in pursuit of a private objective, while maintaining an outward appearance of cooperation. Such insider threats can severely undermine cooperative systems: subtle deviations may degrade collective performance, jeopardize mission success, and compromise operational safety. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating insider threats in cooperative control settings. We introduce an insider-aware, game-theoretic formulation in which the insider's hidden intention is parameterized, allowing the threat identification task to be reformulated as a parameter estimation problem. To address this challenge, we employ an online indirect dual adaptive control approach that simultaneously infers the insider's control strategy and counteracts its negative influence. By injecting properly designed probing signals, the resulting mitigation policy asymptotically recovers the nominal optimal control law - one that would be achieved under full knowledge of the insider's objective. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed identification-mitigation framework and illustrate its capability to preserve team performance even in the presence of covert adversarial behavior.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive three-dimensional third-medium contact framework for modeling complex contact interactions in hyperelastic solids and pneumatically actuated systems. The proposed third-medium formulation embeds a fictitious medium (or third medium) between potentially interacting bodies, enabling a unified and robust treatment of hyperelastic contact and self-contact without the need for discretization of the contact interface. Unlike the widely studied two-dimensional problem, this paper extends the new regularization term given in Reference \\cite{TMCWriggers2} to three-dimensional problems and ensures element quality in a third medium. Due to the need for higher-order elements for the regularization term, this paper details the linearization process of this problem within the finite element framework. In addition, pneumatically actuated systems are considered by introducing a pneumatic term to represent pneumatic loading (pressure or suction) and inducing contact caused by internal inflation. This approach is suitable for complex hyperelastic contact and self-contact, and has potential applications in the fields of soft robotics and flexible mechanisms. The framework is developed in a fully three-dimensional setting, making it also suitable for isogeometric methods and meshless methods. Several benchmark and application-level simulations demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and versatility of the proposed approach. The results highlight the capability of the three-dimensional third-medium model to handle challenging nonlinear contact scenarios relevant to soft materials, soft actuators, and emerging multifunctional structures.",

Our hypertopology provides an analogue of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance on proper metric spaces, and in fact, convergence in the latter implies convergence in the former. Moreover, when restricted to the class of quantum compact metric spaces, our new topology is compatible with the topology of the Gromov-Hausdorff propinquity. We include new examples of noncompact, noncommutative pointed proper quantum metric spaces which are limits, for our new topology, of finite dimensional quantum compact metric spaces. This article thus provides a first answer to the challenging question of how to extend noncommutative metric geometry to the locally compact quantum space realm.",

    "abstract": "Integrating demand-responsive mobility services with transit systems is recognized as a practical and effective strategy to mitigate their impact on traffic congestion and the environment. This study develops an efficient hybrid metaheuristic to solve the integrated dial-a-ride problem by utilizing electric vehicles to minimize operational costs and customer travel time. Customer transfer inconvenience is restricted by a maximum intermodal transfer time to synchronize demand-responsive buses' arrival and transit departures. The proposed metaheuristic addresses the challenges of integrating demand-responsive vehicle routing and charging operations with fixed-route transit systems with capacitated charging stations and partial recharge. We benchmarked our algorithm against a state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming solver on instances with 10-50 customers and two transit lines. Our approach achieves solutions that are, on average, 23.8% better in solution quality within around 2 minutes, outperforming those obtained by the solver using an 8-hour computational time limit. We evaluate the impact of various system parameters to bridge the gap between theory and practice. The results suggest that, from the operator's perspective, while the integrated dial-a-ride service reduces vehicle kilometers traveled, the used fleet size may not necessarily be reduced when ensuring high-quality service for passengers. Moreover, operating the integrated systems is more beneficial in areas with dense transit networks, compared with increases in transit frequency. The findings provide valuable insights for developing integrated dial-a-ride services in practice.",

We prove that light rays in three-dimensional Euclidean space correspond to Reeb orbits in a five-dimensional contact manifold, which are then projected onto a four-dimensional symplectic manifold via symplectic reduction. Leveraging the advantages of phase space, we provide a rigorous definition of caustic surfaces as singularities of the Lagrangian submanifold projection and derive explicit expressions for caustic surfaces in convex lens systems. Furthermore, based on singularity theory, we present a complete classification of stable caustic surfaces and establish a correspondence with classical Seidel aberration theory. Building upon this theory, we propose a method of \\emph{topological optical correction} that overcomes the limitations of traditional optimization algorithms in dealing with complex caustic structures.

    "abstract": "This paper considers a bilevel program. To solve this bilevel program, it is generally necessary to transform it into some single-level optimization problem. One approach is to replace the lower-level program by its KKT conditions to transform the bilevel program as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints (MPCC). Another approach is to apply the lower-level Wolfe/Mond-Weir/extended Mond-Weir duality to transform the bilevel program into some duality-based single-level reformulations, called WDP, MDP, and eMDP respectively in the literature. In this paper, inspired by a conjecture from a recent publication that the tighter feasible region of a reformulation, the better its numerical performance, we present three new duality-based single-level reformulations, called TWDP/TMDP/eTMDP, with tighter feasible regions. Our main goal is to compare all above-mentioned reformulations by designing some direct and relaxation algorithms with projection and implementing these algorithms on 450 test examples generated randomly. Our numerical experiments show that, whether overall comparison or pairwise comparison, at least in our tests, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations were always better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations were always the worst ones among six duality-based reformulations, which indicates that the above conjecture is incorrect. In particular, for the relaxation algorithms, the WDP/MDP/TWDP/TMDP reformulations performed 3-5 times better than the MPCC reformulation, while the eMDP/eTMDP reformulations performed 2 times better than the MPCC reformulation.",

    "title": "Pairs of eventually constant maps and nilpotent pairs",
    "abstract": "Tom Leinster gave a bijective correspondence between the set of operators on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ and the set of pairs consisting of a nilpotent operator and a vector in $V$. Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph.",

    "abstract": "Cohomology theories with values in LCA (locally compact abelian) groups suffer from the problem that the latter do not form an abelian category. However, the category LCA has a canonical abelian category envelope, the heart of a suitable t-structure. It adds formal cokernel objects. We show the surprising result that these abstract cokernels can also be interpreted as Hausdorff topological abelian groups, at least up to lattice isogenies. These need not be locally compact.",

    "title": "Generalized Orthogonal Approximate Message-Passing for Sublinear Sparsity",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses the reconstruction of sparse signals from generalized linear measurements. Signal sparsity is assumed to be sublinear in the signal dimension while it was proportional to the signal dimension in conventional research. Approximate message-passing (AMP) has poor convergence properties for sensing matrices beyond standard Gaussian matrices. To solve this convergence issue, generalized orthogonal AMP (GOAMP) is proposed for signals with sublinear sparsity. The main feature of GOAMP is the so-called Onsager correction to realize asymptotic Gaussianity of estimation errors. The Onsager correction in GOAMP is designed via state evolution for orthogonally invariant sensing matrices in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity and measurement dimension tend to infinity at sublinear speed in the signal dimension. When the support of non-zero signals does not contain a neighborhood of the origin, GOAMP using Bayesian denoisers is proved to achieve error-free signal reconstruction for linear measurements if and only if the measurement dimension is larger than a threshold, which is equal to that of AMP for standard Gaussian sensing matrices. Numerical simulations are also presented for linear measurements and 1-bit compressed sensing. When ill-conditioned sensing matrices are used, GOAMP for sublinear sparsity is shown to outperform existing reconstruction algorithms, including generalized AMP for sublinear sparsity.",

    "title": "When does Gaussian equivalence fail and how to fix it: Non-universal behavior of random features with quadratic scaling",
    "abstract": "A major effort in modern high-dimensional statistics has been devoted to the analysis of linear predictors trained on nonlinear feature embeddings via empirical risk minimization (ERM). Gaussian equivalence theory (GET) has emerged as a powerful universality principle in this context: it states that the behavior of high-dimensional, complex features can be captured by Gaussian surrogates, which are more amenable to analysis. Despite its remarkable successes, numerical experiments show that this equivalence can fail even for simple embeddings -- such as polynomial maps -- under general scaling regimes.\n  We investigate this breakdown in the setting of random feature (RF) models in the quadratic scaling regime, where both the number of features and the sample size grow quadratically with the data dimension. We show that when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the data, such as generalized linear models, GET yields incorrect predictions. To capture the correct asymptotics, we introduce a Conditional Gaussian Equivalent (CGE) model, which can be viewed as appending a low-dimensional non-Gaussian component to an otherwise high-dimensional Gaussian model. This hybrid model retains the tractability of the Gaussian framework and accurately describes RF models in the quadratic scaling regime. We derive sharp asymptotics for the training and test errors in this setting, which continue to agree with numerical simulations even when GET fails.\n  Our analysis combines general results on CLT for Wiener chaos expansions and a careful two-phase Lindeberg swapping argument. Beyond RF models and quadratic scaling, our work hints at a rich landscape of universality phenomena in high-dimensional ERM.",

    "title": "Permutation Flows I: Triangulations of Flow Polytopes (Research Announcement)",
    "abstract": "We introduce a new broadly unifying family of combinatorial objects, which we call permutation flows, associated to an acyclic directed graph $G$ together with a framing $F$. This new family is combinatorially rich and contains as special cases various families of combinatorial objects that are frequently studied in the literature, as is the case of permutations, circular permutations, multipermutations, Stirling permutations, Catalan objects and their generalizations. When permutation flows are decorated with compatible shuffles, they also include the combinatorics of parking functions and their generalizations.\n  This model is geometrically rich. We show that permutation flow shuffles define a family of unimodular triangulations of the flow polytope $F_G(a)$ on $G$ with an integer balanced netflow vector a where only the last entry is negative. As an application we provide a new proof of the Lidskii volume formula of Baldoni and Vergne for this family of polytopes and a reformulation of the same formula where every term is explained by the nature of the combinatorial objects involved. Permutation flow triangulations extend the Danilov, Karzanov, and Koshevoy triangulations that were defined for the case where a=e_0-e_n. We provide a formula for the h^*-polynomial of the flow polytope as the descent enumerating polynomial of permutation flows.\n  The model comes with an order structure induced by intuitive operators on permutation flows which we call the weak order. This order includes as special cases the weak order on permutations, the Tamari lattice, order ideals in Young's lattice, and their generalizations, among others. It was conjectured in 2020 by the three authors, together with Benedetti, Harris, and Morales, that this poset is in general a lattice. This conjecture has been recently established with independent proofs by Bell and Ceballos, and by Berggren and Serhiyenko.",
