    "title": "Exact Recovery in the Geometric Hidden Community Model",
    "abstract": "Hidden community problems, such as community detection in the Stochastic Block Model (SBM), submatrix localization, and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ synchronization, have received considerable attention in the probability, statistics, and information-theory literature. Motivated by transitive behavior in social networks, which tend to exhibit high triangle density, recent works have considered hidden community models in spatially-embedded networks. In particular, Baccelli and Sankararaman proposed the Geometric SBM, a spatially-embedded analogue of the standard SBM with dramatically more triangles. In this paper, we consider the problem of exact recovery for the Geometric Hidden Community Model (GHCM) of Gaudio, Guan, Niu, and Wei, which generalizes the Geometric SBM to allow for arbitrary pairwise observation distributions. Under mild technical assumptions, we find the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery in the ``distance-dependent'' GHCM, which allows the pairwise distributions to depend on distance as well as community labels, thus completing the picture of exact recovery in spatially-embedded hidden community models.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a systematic analysis and extension of the sparse radial basis function network (SparseRBFnet) previously introduced for solving nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Based on its adaptive-width shallow kernel network formulation, we further investigate its function-space characterization, operator evaluation, and computational algorithm. We provide a unified description of the solution space for a broad class of radial basis functions (RBFs). Under mild assumptions, this space admits a characterization as a Besov space, independent of the specific kernel choice. We further demonstrate how the explicit kernel-based structure enables quasi-analytical evaluation of both differential and nonlocal operators, including fractional Laplacians. On the computational end, we study the adaptive-width network and related three-phase training strategy through a comparison with variants concerning the modeling and algorithmic details. In particular, we assess the roles of second-order optimization, inner-weight training, network adaptivity, and anisotropic kernel parameterizations. Numerical experiments on high-order, fractional, and anisotropic PDE benchmarks illustrate the empirical insensitivity to kernel choice, as well as the resulting trade-offs between accuracy, sparsity, and computational cost. Collectively, these results consolidate and generalize the theoretical and computational framework of SparseRBFnet, supporting accurate sparse representations with efficient operator evaluation and offering theory-grounded guidance for algorithmic and modeling choices.",

We present simple necessary conditions for the first player to have a winning strategy, and establish an equivalence between winning sets that guarantee a win for the first player and maximal prefix codes. Using this equivalence, we derive a necessary algebraic condition for winning, and exhibit a family of games for which this algebraic condition is in fact equivalent to winning.

We further extend this correspondence to a geometric relationship between radial sectors of the Lam\u00e9 curve and arc lengths of the spiral, providing a physical interpretation where keplerian motion on the Lam\u00e9 curve corresponds to uniform motion on the spiral. Additionally, we derive an explicit central force law for keplerian motion along the Lam\u00e9 curve.

On the other hand, modular polynomials for other invariants of higher level structures have also been studied. For example, the modular polynomials for the Legendre $\u03bb$-invariant and the Weber functions are well-known. In this paper, we give another approach to construct modular polynomials of higher level purely algebraically. In particular, we show the existence of modular polynomials for invariants directly related to models of elliptic curves, such as the coefficients of Montgomery and Hessian curves.

The nodal deficiency, defined as the difference between the eigenvalue index and the nodal domain count, is known by the Courant nodal domain theorem to be nonnegative. We show that, for small neck widths, the nodal deficiencies of the dumbbell eigenfunctions are no smaller than the nodal deficiencies of the limiting eigenfunctions in the ends, and we provide conditions under which equality is achieved.

Bounds on the lengths of potential non-trivial cycles are derived and analyzed, and two algorithms are presented for computing lower bounds on cycle lengths. Finally, experimental tests are given to illustrate our approach.",

This paper introduces a new family of directional Spearman's footrule coefficients for multivariate data, defined within the copula framework to clearly separate marginal behavior from dependence structure. We establish their main theoretical properties, showing full consistency with the classical footrule, including behavior under independence and extreme dependence, as well as symmetry and reflection properties. Nonparametric rank-based estimators are proposed and their asymptotic consistency is discussed. Explicit expressions for several known families of copulas illustrate the ability of the proposed coefficients to detect directional dependence patterns undetected by classical measures.",

Herein we consider arbitrary mean zero Martingales and their extended-valued stopping times, proving two fundamental theorems and a general corollary. Examples, counter-examples and discussion are also included.\n  The first theorem establishes conditions under which a stopped martingale's expected value can be characterized by a finite real number, also yielding a new expectation limit. Two corollaries and an application provide information on the rate of decay of the tail probability of the stopping time.\n  The second theorem provides sufficient conditions to ensure that an extended-valued stopping time is finite with probability one. We demonstrate these results through various examples and explore their implications for different families of martingales. Our findings extend classical results in martingale theory and provide new insights into the behavior of stopped martingales, especially when the expected values are the stopped Martingale on the set where the extended-valued stopping time $T$ is finite is different from the expected value of the Martingale at time 1.",

Independently, we give a construction of genus-$2$ curves with split Jacobian and rank $2$, producing a subfamily of logarithmic density at least $ 2/21$.

We formulate the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE) for a given fronthaul capacity. We develop an SE expression for this scenario based on the hardening bound. We compute the expression in closed form for maximum ratio transmission, which reveals the relative impact of the two types of quantization distortion. We then formulate a bit split optimization problem and propose an algorithm that exactly solves it.\n  Numerical results demonstrate how the relative importance of assigning bits to CSI and precoding varies depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.",

Our results quantify the impact of ensemble size, dimension, and observation noise, and provide explicit bounds on the propagation of stochastic errors over long time horizons. The analysis relies on a detailed study of stochastic Riccati difference equations driven by matrix-valued noncentral Wishart fluctuations.

We prove that the coefficients of the equivariant inverse $Z$-polynomials are honest representations and that these polynomials are palindromic. Explicit formulas are obtained for uniform matroids equipped with the symmetric group. The corresponding formulas for $q$-niform matroids are derived using the Comparison Theorem for unipotent representations. For arbitrary equivariant paving matroids, explicit expressions are obtained by relating the polynomials of a matroid to those of its relaxation. We show that these polynomials are equivariantly unimodal and strongly inductively log-concave for both uniform and $q$-niform matroids.

However, in this article we propose an axiomatic framework for such diffusions on a finite time horizon. We isolate admissibility conditions and additional regularity hypotheses on a general driving family under which the associated diffusion, constructed as a Doob transform of point-interaction Schr\u00f6dinger semigroup kernels, exhibits the same point interaction structure. In particular, for the ground-state driving family, we obtain a heuristic alternative construction of the skew-product diffusion based on Kolmogorov continuity arguments. We also consider formal applications of this framework to some driving families generated by measures, including the Lebesgue-driven diffusion, which is the exponentially tilted planar Brownian motion.",

    "abstract": "Multimarginal optimal transport (MOT) has gained increasing attention in recent years, notably due to its relevance in machine learning and statistics, where one seeks to jointly compare and align multiple probability distributions. This paper presents a unified and complete Kantorovich duality theory for MOT problem on general Polish product spaces with bounded continuous cost function. For marginal compact spaces, the duality identity is derived through a convex-analytic reformulation, that identifies the dual problem as a Fenchel-Rockafellar conjugate. We obtain dual attainment and show that optimal potentials may always be chosen in the class of $c$-conjugate families, thereby extending classical two-marginal conjugacy principle into a genuinely multimarginal setting. In non-compact setting, where direct compactness arguments are unavailable, we recover duality via a truncation-tightness procedure based on weak compactness of multimarginal transference plans and boundedness of the cost. We prove that the dual value is preserved under restriction to compact subsets and that admissible dual families can be regularized into uniformly bounded $c$-conjugate potentials. The argument relies on a refined use of $c$-splitting sets and their equivalence with multimarginal $c$-cyclical monotonicity. We then obtain dual attainment and exact primal-dual equality for MOT on arbitrary Polish spaces, together with a canonical representation of optimal dual potentials by $c$-conjugacy. These results provide a structural foundation for further developments in probabilistic and statistical analysis of MOT, including stability, differentiability, and asymptotic theory under marginal perturbations.",

We consider a self-gravitating, barotropic fluid and obtain the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 equations of the system by Lagrangian reduction. Using the decomposition of general relativity into 3 + 1 dimensions, with a direction of time defined, the gauge invariance of the action over spacetime diffeomorphisms permits a 3-dimensional description of the fluid diffeomorphism by gauge fixing. The configuration space thus mirrors the Newtonian case, and by employing the Euler-Poincar\u00e9 theorem, we derive the Eulerian equations of motion, in the same form as the PDEs from Newtonian fluid dynamics. The equations of motion are then derived, where the fluid variables are measured in a separate frame of reference from the variables involving gravity. Furthermore, the general relativistic barotropic fluid exhibits a Kelvin-Noether circulation conservation, which we derive in both the inertial and moving frames of reference. Finally, potential applications to Numerical Relativity are discussed.",

They are normally utilized at the start of the process to move the angular dependence within plane waves and Coulomb potentials, and the like, into a sum over Spherical Harmonics that allows the angular integration to be carried out. These have historically been ``two-range'' addition theorems, characterized by the two-fold notation $r_{>}=Max[r_{1},r_{2}]$ and $r_{<}=Min[r_{1},r_{2}]$ and comprising a single infinite series. More recently, ``one-range'' addition theorems have been created that have no such piecewise notation, but at the cost of a second infinite series. We use a very different approach to derive an infinite set of addition theorems for Slater orbitals and its derivatives that retain the one-range variable dependence but have, at worst, a finite second series rather than an infinite one. Also unlike previous addition theorems, they are applicable to more than one coordinate system. One of these addition theorem may also be used for Yukawa-like functions that may appear late in the reduction of amplitude integrals and we show its utility for an integral that has stubbornly defied reduction to analytic form for nearly sixty years.",

We formulate the approach as a sieve M-estimator and establish weak consistency. Computationally, the problem reduces to a Poisson regression, allowing implementation via standard gradient boosting software. A key theoretical advantage is that the method avoids the temporal inconsistencies that arise in landmark Cox models.

    "abstract": "This paper develops an invariant--geometric interpretation of the canonization problem for simple undirected weighted graphs based on the {discrete moving frame method} for finite groups. We consider the action of the {pair group} $S_n^{(2)}$ on the space of edge weights of a graph. It is emphasized that the classical algebraic approach aimed at describing the ring of polynomial invariants of this action quickly becomes computationally impractical due to the explosive growth in the number and degrees of generators. The main result is a formalization of a canonical labeling of a graph as a {discrete moving frame} in the sense of Olver: a discrete orbit cross-section is fixed, in particular by a lexicographic rule, and for each configuration of edge weights one defines a permutation in $S_n^{(2)}$ that maps it to its canonical representative. The coordinates of the canonical representative are interpreted as a {complete system of invariants} for the action of $S_n^{(2)}$ that separates orbits, i.e., isomorphism classes of graphs. It is shown that the invariants obtained via such orbit canonization are of a non-algebraic nature and belong to the class of {semi-algebraic functions}. We do not propose a new computational algorithm; instead, we provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for the very concept of canonization by viewing it as a process of constructing a discrete moving frame and the corresponding system of semi-algebraic invariants.",

We show that the classical Hall completion $G\\otimes_{\\mathcal{H}} R$ embeds as an abstract group (the embedding is not an $R$-homomorphism) into $G \\otimes_{\\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R$, such that $G\\otimes_{\\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R \\simeq (G \\otimes_{\\mathcal{H}} R) \\times D$, where $D$ is an $R$-module and the direct product is a product of abstract groups (not $R$-groups!).

Moreover, in addition to the algebraic structure, we describe precisely how raising to an $R$-exponent works in the group $G \\otimes_{\\mathcal{N}_{2,R}} R$. To do this, we introduce a new type of commutators, the so-called c-commutators, which are interesting in their own right. These results answer an old question of Remeslennikov about the algebraic structure of free 2-nilpotent R-groups in the quasivariety $\\mathcal{N}_{2,R}$. Indeed, it was shown in \\cite{AMN} that if $G$ is a free 2-nilpotent group with basis $X$ (in the variety of abstract 2-nilpotent groups), then $G \\otimes_{\\mathbb{N}_{2,R}} R$ is a free 2-nilpotent R-group in $\\mathcal{N}_{2,R}$ with basis $X$.

    "abstract": "Classical spectral theory gives a complete description of a single normal operator, but it fails for noncommuting operators, where no canonical joint spectrum or simultaneous diagonalization exists. Existing approaches provide only partial solutions: joint spectra apply mainly to commuting families, noncommutative geometry emphasizes global invariants that obscure local structure, and topos-theoretic methods capture contextuality while losing higher coherence information. This paper proposes a geometric and higher-categorical reformulation of the spectral problem for noncommuting operators. Local classical spectra associated with commutative subalgebras are organized into a stack-valued object, called a spectral stack, which retains automorphism and unitary equivalence data between contexts. Noncommutativity is thereby interpreted as nontrivial descent data rather than a breakdown of spectral theory. Using homotopical and derived constructions, we define functorial invariants that measure obstructions to global spectral assembly and extend classical index-theoretic ideas. The resulting framework views noncommutative operator algebras as geometric objects equipped with a spectral atlas, providing a concise bridge between operator theory, homotopy theory, and higher geometry.",

We then examine a planar extension of this process which moves along orthogonal directions. A process with velocity depending on the direction is also examined, and its mean conditional on the initial direction and the number of direction changes is given in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions. We conjecture that, in the hydrodynamic limit, this process is absorbed at a point in an arbitrarily small time. We finally study a motion with time-dependent velocity.

In this setting, geometric curves are obtained as projections of generator trajectories, and branching is implemented as a primitive operation through exact inheritance of generator state.\n  At every finite depth, the resulting structure is a finite union of analytic curve segments that is smooth across branch events. Two structural results relate this generator-driven construction to classical discrete models of tree-based fractals. First, a combinatorial universality theorem shows that any discrete tree specification, including those arising from iterated function systems and L-systems, can be compiled into an analytic generator tree whose induced discrete scaffold is isomorphic at every finite depth. Second, under standard contractive assumptions, a canopy set equivalence theorem establishes that the accumulation set of analytic branch endpoints coincides with the attractor of the corresponding discrete construction.\n  These results separate local geometric regularity from global fractal complexity, showing that fractality is determined by recursive branching and scaling rather than by local non-smoothness. The framework provides a smooth representation of tree-based fractals that preserves both their finite combinatorial structure and their asymptotic limit geometry.",

A diagonal similarity transforms $A_n(a,b,c)$ into a symmetric Toeplitz matrix, yielding explicit eigenpairs, a Chebyshev determinant/characteristic polynomial formula, and a closed Green kernel for the inverse. As an application we give sharp extremal eigenvalue and conditioning formulae in the natural weighted Hilbert space induced by this similarity. Specialising to the classical repunit matrix $A_n(d,d+1,1)$, we show that $\\det(A_n(d,d+1,1))=1+d+\\cdots+d^{n}$ and obtain a finite cosine product factorisation of this repunit polynomial, together with quantitative bounds and an explicit inverse in terms of repunits.",

    "title": "High-Rate Quantized Matrix Multiplication: Theory and Practice",
    "abstract": "This work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (MatMul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\u03a3_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\u03a3_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\\frac{2\u03c0e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\u03a3_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).",

Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the substantial reduction in computational cost achieved by the proposed method.

Domain decomposition technology treats the general domain as the union of some star-shaped subdomains, which can be handled using the direct-line method. The direct-line method demonstrates rapid convergence of the semi-discrete eigenvalues towards the exact eigenvalues of the elliptic operator, thereby naturally capturing the singularities. We also establish optimal error estimates for the proposed method. Especially, our method can handle multiple singular point problems in general regions, which are difficult to deal with by most methods. On the other hand, the inverse elasticity problem is constructed as a energy functional minimization problem with total variational regularization, we use the aforementioned method as a forward solver to reconstruct the lam\u00e9 coefficient of multiple singular points in general regions. Our method can simultaneously deduce heterogeneous $\u03bc$ and $\u03bb$ between different materials.

    "abstract": "This work presents new results and understanding of the Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for inverse problems. In particular, using a Lagrangian dual perspective we show that EnKF can be derived from the sample average approximation (SAA) of the Lagrangian dual function. The beauty of this new duality perspective is that it facilitates us to prove and numerically verify a novel non-asymptotic convergence result for the EnKF. Motivated by the new perspective, we also present a new convergence improvement strategy for the Ensemble Kalman Inversion Algorithm (EnKI), which is an iterative version of the EnKF for inverse problems. In particular, we propose an adaptive multiplicative correction to the sample covariance matrix at each iteration and we call this new algorithm as EnKI-MC (I). Based on the new duality perspective, we derive an expression for the optimal correction factor at each iteration of the EnKI algorithm to accelerate the convergence. In addition, we also consider an ensemble specific multiplicative covariance correction strategy (EnKI-MC (II)) where a different correction is employed for each ensemble. By viewing EnKI through the lens of fixed-point iteration, we also provide theoretical results that guarantees the convergence of EnKI-MC (I) algorithm. Numerical investigations for the deconvolution problem, initial condition inversion in advection-convection problem, initial condition inversion in a Lorenz 96 model, and inverse problem constrained by elliptic partial differential equation are conducted to verify the non-asymptotic results for EnKF and to assess the performance of convergence improvement strategies for EnKI. The numerical results suggest that the proposed strategies for EnKI not only led to faster convergence in comparison to the currently employed techniques but also better quality solutions at termination of the algorithm.",

    "title": "The stability priority of spatial-temporal coupled compact element methods over decoupled compact element methods",
    "abstract": "With the increasing industrial demands, two families of high-order numerical schemes are widely used within the computational fluid dynamics community. One is the method of line, which relies on Runge-Kutta (RK) time-stepping applied to a semi-discrete, spatio-temporally decoupled formulation. The other is the family of Lax-Wendroff (LW) type method, which are inherently spatial-temporal coupled and are constructed within a multi-stage multi-derivative (MSMD) framework. This paper, for the first time, conducted a comparative Fourier stability analysis of RK and LW method to distinguish the dispersion and dissipation effects of numerical schemes respectively. Through rigorous theoretical derivation and consistent numerical validation, we draw the following conclusions: While explicit RK line methods are straightforward like Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method and flux reconstruction (FR) method, they employ from a decoupling of spatial and temporal accuracy, thus discarding flow field evolution information and requiring small time steps. In contrast, spatial-temporal coupled compact methods, such as the gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) and the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver, utilize initial-value information from space far more effectively for time evolution. Even with just one additional order of spatial-temporal coupled information, they show better stability compared to RK methods. This provides new insights for CFD algorithm design, emphasizing the need for consistency between the dependence in the physical domain and that in numerical domain.",

In this paper, for an ensemble of block-structured matrices where entries in a block take the same value, we numerically study the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent. It is observed that also for this ensemble the ratio is strongly concentrated around some value depending only on a few key parameters of the ensemble.

Our main theorem establishes that this property does descend under proper morphisms between smooth affine surfaces of logarithmic Kodaira dimension at most zero. The proof relies essentially on the recent classification of smooth complex affine surfaces of log non-general type characterized by these two properties. As a further application, we classify smooth affine surfaces properly dominated by the complex algebraic 2-torus, thereby clarifying an earlier remark of M. Furushima.",

Classical double point formulas express the fundamental class of the closure of the double point locus of $F$ in terms of global invariants of source and target spaces, as well as $F$. In this paper we extend these results by computing a one-parameter cohomological deformation of the double point formula given by the SSM class. We compute the SSM class of the double point locus in a large cohomological degree range. The leading term in our new formulas recovers the classical double point formula of Fulton and Laksov, while higher-degree terms provide explicit universal corrections. Our approach uses interpolation techniques for SSM-Thom polynomials of multisingularities, recently developed by Koncki, Nekarda, Ohmoto and Rim\u00e1nyi. We also compute SSM-Thom polynomials for the singularities $A_0$ and $A_1$ in the same range. As an application, we show how the deformed formulas yield refined geometric information about those singularity loci through a theorem of Aluffi and Ohmoto, including constraints on when such loci can arise as complete intersections.",

The proposed approach is applied to two- (i.e., planar) and three-dimensional heliocentric phases of spacecraft flight from Earth to Mars under the restricted two-body dynamics.

In order to find the desired treatment plan, a decision maker must balance these objectives as well as the level of robustness towards uncertainty against each other. This paper showcases a quantitative approach to do so, which combines the theoretical model with the ability to deal with practical challenges. To this end, the uncertainty, which can be expressed via the so-called dose-influence matrix, is modelled using interval matrices. We use inverse robustness to introduce an additional objective, which aims to maximize the volume of the uncertainty set. A multi-criteria approach allows to handle the uncertainty while keeping appropriate values of the other objective functions. We solve the resulting quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problem (QCQP) by first relaxing it to a convex semidefinite problem (SDP) and then reconstructing optimal solutions of the QCQP from solutions of the SDP.",

This paper establishes new extremal results in spectral graph theory by investigating the signless Laplacian spectral radius ($Q$-index) of graphs with forbidden subgraphs. We present a $Q$-spectral analog of classical Nosal-type theorems, providing sharp conditions that guarantee the existence of either a $4$-cycle or a large star $K_{1,m-k}$ in a graph. The main theorem states that for integers $k \\geq 0$ and graphs $G$ with size $m \\geq \\max\\{7k+31, k^2+8(k+1)\\}$, if $q(G) \\geq q(S^+_{m,k+1})$, then $G$ must contain a $4$-cycle or $K_{1,m-k}$, unless $G$ is isomorphic to the extremal graph $S^+_{m,k+1}$ formed by adding $k+1$ independent edges to the star $K_{1,m-k-1}$. This result refines previous work on star embeddings by Wang and Guo [Journal of Algebraic Combinatorics, 59 (2024) 213--224], and completes the $Q$-spectral counterpart to Wang's adjacency spectral theorem for $4$-cycle containment [Discrete Math., 345 (2022) 112973].

Our method allows also to prove Lipschitz continuity in spatial variables for such solutions into a wide class of CAT$(0)$ spaces, answering a long-standing open problem in the field. Our approach is based on an elliptic regularization of the gradient flow of the Dirichlet energy and even in the case of smooth Riemannian targets provides a novel viewpoint, together with a new Dynamical Variational Principle and a new proof of the celebrated Eells-Sampson theorem. The spatial Lipschitz regularity for such weak solutions is achieved by fully exploiting the variational structure of the problem at the regularized level and introducing a parabolic frequency function of Almgren-Poon type. Our contribution is the first instance of the use of monotonicity methods for parabolic deformations of maps into singular targets.",

    "abstract": "Fractional evolution equations with memory terms are widely used to model anomalous diffusion, viscoelastic response, and hereditary dynamics in physics, biology, and engineering. Among the recently introduced operators, the Atangana--Baleanu (AB) derivatives have attracted considerable attention due to their non-singular Mittag--Leffler kernels. However, their analytic treatment remains limited, as the AB kernel does not fall within the classical Volterra or Bernstein-function frameworks.\n  This paper develops a unified resolvent approach for AB-type evolution equations in Banach spaces. Using a Laplace-domain formulation inspired by Hille--Phillips theory, we introduce a fractional resolvent associated with the AB kernel and establish optimal bounds on sectorial contours. Under the natural condition $\u03b2<1+\u03b1$, we construct an AB--Mittag--Leffler resolvent family and obtain a complete representation of mild solutions to the AB Cauchy problem. Sharp stability and regularity estimates of Mittag--Leffler type are derived, including fractional-domain bounds.\n  Numerical illustrations confirm the predicted decay, and connections with non-autonomous operators, maximal $L^p$-regularity, and weighted AB kernels are outlined. The results place AB-type equations within a functional-analytic framework comparable to the classical theory for Caputo and Volterra models.",

In prior work, we have developed techniques based on Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm (TMOP) to adapt a given high-order mesh to the geometry and solution of the partial differential equation (PDE). Here, we extend this framework to address two key gaps in the literature for high-order mesh r-adaptivity. First, we introduce tangential relaxation on curved surfaces using solely the discrete mesh representation, eliminating the need for access to underlying geometry (e.g., CAD model). Second, we ensure a continuously positive Jacobian determinant throughout the domain. This determinant positivity is essential for using the high-order mesh resulting from r-adaptivity with arbitrary quadrature schemes in simulations. The proposed approach is demonstrated to be robust using a variety of numerical experiments.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates density driven flow in porous media, focusing on the roles of viscosity contrast, density contrast, and linear adsorption. In this setup, the fluid on top is heavier and more viscous than the fluid below. Under the effect of gravity, this system becomes unstable, and finger-like structures appear. The phenomenon is described mathematically by coupling Darcy's law with a convection-diffusion reaction equation. The nonlinearity in this model arises mainly from the concentration dependence of viscosity and the convective transport term. The existence of a unique pair of weak solutions is shown in both two and three dimensions using the Galerkin approximation method and truncation technique. Moreover, an application of the maximum principle shows non-negativity of the concentration. Additionally, we analyze the long-time behavior of the solution and prove that the concentration converges exponentially to zero in the $L^p$-norm for all $1 \\le p \\le \\infty$ as $t \\to \\infty.$ To complement the theoretical analysis, we perform numerical simulations based on a pressure formulation. By tracking total kinetic energy and mixing measures over time, we discuss the instability and the mixing efficiency, respectively. The present study reveals that although increasing the density contrast amplifies the total kinetic energy, the marginal impact diminishes with successive increments of density contrast. Similarly, while adsorption acts to suppress mixing, its efficiency in doing so tends to saturate with further increases. These non-linear sensitivities are predicted by our theoretical estimates and confirmed by the numerical simulations.",

The deep integration of communication and sensing is widely recognized as a core 6G vision, underscoring the importance of comprehensive environment awareness. Accurate channel modeling forms the foundation of 6G system design and optimization, and channel sounders provide the essential empirical basis. However, existing channel sounders, although supporting wide bandwidth and large antenna arrays in selected bands, generally lack cross-band capability, struggle in dynamic scenarios, and provide limited environmental awareness. The absence of detailed environmental information restricts the development of environment-aware channel models. To address this gap, we propose a multi-modal sensing and channel sounding fusion platform that enables temporally and spatially synchronized acquisition of images, point clouds, geolocation information, and multi-band multi-antenna channel data. The modular architecture facilitates rapid deployment in diverse dynamic environments. The platform supports Sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands with up to 1 GHz bandwidth and 1 ns delay resolution, enabling multi-antenna measurements with a channel switching rate of 8 ms. Moreover, it achieves centimeter-level and 360\u00b0 environmental sensing accuracy and meter-level positioning accuracy. Key performance metrics of the platform, including dynamic range, phase stability, delay resolution, and multimodal data synchronization, are validated through vehicle-to-infrastructure measurement campaign. The established platform supports environment-channel joint modeling, enabling analysis and optimization of channel models in dynamic 6G scenarios.",

Our main focus are graphs sharing a common node set on which edge weights within certain clusters grow to infinity. As intra-cluster connectivity increases, we show that the corresponding graph Laplacians converge -- in the resolvent sense -- to an effective graph Laplacian. This effective limit Laplacian is defined on a coarsened graph, where each highly connected cluster is collapsed into a single node. In the undirected setting, the effective Laplacian arises naturally from agregating over tightly connected clusters. In the directed case, the limiting graph structure depends on the precise manner in which connectivity increases; with the corresponding effects mediated by the left and right kernel structure of the Laplacian restricted to high-connectivity clusters. Our results shed light on the emergence of coarse-grained dynamics in large-scale networks and contribute to spectral graph theory of directed graphs.",

Crucially, we focus on the setting where neither $A$ nor $B$ can be assumed to be positive- (or negative-) semi-definite. We are hence outside the classical form-theoretic framework, where results based on on Kato's monotone convergence theorem would be applicable. Thus, instead of form methods, our approach builds on classical resolvent identities to study convergence of the family $\\{A_\u03b2\\}_\u03b2$. Our findings are that: (i) Strong resolvent convergence holds (without further spectral assumptions) if $A + \u03b2B$ is self-adjoint and the compression of $A$ onto $\\ker(B)$ is well behaved. (ii) Under the more detailed assumption that $0 \\in \u03c3(B)$ is isolated, norm resolvent convergence can be established even if $A+\u03b2B$ is merely closed, provided the quasi-nilpotent part of $B$ at zero vanishes and certain conditions on the interplay of $A$ and $B$ are met. Importantly, if $B$ is not self-adjoint we find that the limit operator not only depends on $\\ker(B)$ as a Hilbert space, but crucially also on the precise form of the Riesz projector at $0 \\in \u03c3(B)$ onto $\\ker(B)$.",

    "abstract": "Classical existence theorems and solution methods for quadratic programming traditionally rely on the analytical properties of real numbers, specifically compactness and completeness. These tools are unavailable in general linearly ordered fields, such as the field of rational numbers or non-Archimedean structures, rendering standard analytical proofs insufficient in these general algebraic settings. In this paper, we establish a unified algebraic framework for the decidability of indefinite quadratic programming subject to linear constraints over general linearly ordered fields. We prove a generalized Eaves' theorem, demonstrating that if a quadratic function -- encompassing convex, non-convex, or degenerate (linear) cases -- is bounded from below on a polyhedron, the minimum is attained within the field itself, regardless of topological completeness. Our approach replaces classical analytical arguments with algebraic induction on dimension and polyhedral decomposition. Based on this foundation, we propose an exact, deterministic algorithm within the Blum--Shub--Smale model of computation that decides boundedness and computes a global minimizer using only field operations. We show that the problem is solvable in finite time via a recursive search over orthant-restricted facets. Finally, we note that linearly constrained quadratic programming represents the maximal class of polynomial optimization problems where exact solutions are structurally guaranteed within the original field, thereby demarcating the algebraic boundary of exact optimization over ordered structures.",

    "abstract": "The mutual shadow area of pairs of surface regions is used for guiding the study of the spectral components and rank of their wave interaction, as captured by the corresponding moment matrix blocks. It is demonstrated that the mutual shadow area provides an asymptotically accurate predictor of the location of the singular value curve knee. This predicted knee index is shown to partition the interacting parts of the range and domain of blocks into two subspaces that can be associated with different wave phenomena: an \"aperture\" subspace of dimension that scales with the subdomains area (or length in 2-D) and a remainder \"diffraction\" subspace of dimension that scales much slower with the electrical length, depending on the geometric configuration. For interactions between open surface domains typical for the common hierarchical partitioning in most fast solvers, the latter can be attributed to the domain edges visible by its interacting counterpart. For interactions in 3-D with a small aspect angles between the source and observers, the diffraction subspace dimension is dominant in determining the rank until fairly large electrical lengths are reached. This explains the delayed asymptotic scaling of ranks and impressive fast solver performance observed in recent literature for seemingly arbitrary scatterers with no special geometric characteristics. In the extreme cases of \"endfire\" reduced dimensionality interactions, where the shadow area vanishes, the diffraction governs also the asymptotic rank, which translates to superior asymptotic solver performance.",

    "abstract": "Due to the fundamental connection between next-symbol prediction and compression, modern predictive models, such as large language models (LLMs), can be combined with entropy coding to achieve compression rates that surpass those of standard compression algorithms. However, this approach relies on the assumption that the predictive model produces identical output distributions at both the encoder and decoder, since even small mismatches can cause the decoding to fail. This assumption often fails with complex predictive models, particularly those based on neural networks, a phenomenon referred to as non-determinism.\n  In this work, we propose a new compression algorithm based on next-token prediction that is robust to arbitrarily large, but structured, prediction mismatches. We prove the correctness of the proposed scheme under a formal mismatch certification, characterize its theoretical performance, and validate it experimentally on real datasets. Our results demonstrate reliable operation within the certified mismatch regime while achieving compression ratios that exceed those of commonly used compression methods.",

Many well-known nonlocal operators enter into our framework, and in addition one may introduce many other, new nonlocal operators that have not yet been considered in the literature. We use the abstract theory of (nonlinear) semigroups generated by subgradients of proper, lower semicontinuous and convex functionals on Hilbert spaces to build a rigorous and applicable framework that works for many classical elliptic operators but also nonlocal or sometimes fractional operators. After recalling the notion of a nonlinear semigroup generated by subgradients and $j$-subgradients of the associated energy functions, we introduce a general class of (nonlinear) nonlocal elliptic type operators and define rigorously subgradients and $j$-subgradients of such functionals that generate (nonlinear) submarkovian semigroups and hence, the abstract Cauchy problem associated with these subgradients and/or $j$-subgradients is wellposed. The existence and the qualitative properties of solutions to these Cauchy problems and the corresponding semigroups are investigated. More precisely, we show some comparison and maximum principles, submarkovian, domination, ultracontractivity properties, and some H\u00f6lder type estimates for these semigroups of operators. These results are usually useful in several branches of pure and applied partial differential equations. We finish the paper by giving several examples of nonlocal operators in Euclidean spaces, graphs, metric random walk spaces, fractional Brownian motions, and L\u00e9vy flights, that fit in our general framework.",

In this note, we introduce and analyze an algorithm for CDA for the two- and three-dimensional stochastic convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations (CBFEs) driven by either additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise. The model is believed to provide an accurate description when the flow velocity exceeds the regime of validity of Darcy's law and the porosity remains moderately large. We derive sufficient conditions on the nudging parameter and the spatial resolution of observations that ensure convergence of the assimilated solution to the true stochastic flow. We demonstrate convergence in the mean-square sense, and additionally establish pathwise convergence in the presence of additive noise. The CBFEs, also known as Navier-Stokes equations with damping, exhibit enhanced stability properties due to the presence of nonlinear damping term. In particular, we show that nonlinear damping not only enables the implementation of CDA in three dimensions but also yields improved convergence results in two dimensions when compared to the classical Navier-Stokes equations.",

For $p$ sufficiently close to $m$, the maximizers are smooth, whereas for $p<m$ no bubbling occurs. A key tool in our analysis is the application of techniques from the theory of topological tensor products, which appear to be well suited for studying eigenvalue-related optimization problems.",

We establish contraction rates for the posterior distribution and the variational approximation in the regime of low-regularity parameters. The main novelty of the study lies in relaxing the condition that the ground truth parameter must lie in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the Gaussian process prior, which is commonly imposed in existing studies on posterior contraction rate analysis [14,40,44]. The analysis relies on a delicate approximation argument that suitably balances various error sources. We illustrate the general theory on three nonlinear inverse problems for PDEs.",

The key contributions are twofold. First, we construct a novel model for the PGIEP, where the optimization variables are located on the product of a Stiefel manifold and a Euclidean manifold. This model enables the application of optimization algorithms on the Stiefel manifold, a capability that is not achievable with existing models. Additionally, the gradient Lipschitz continuity of the objective function is proved. Second, a parameterized Stiefel multilayer perceptron (P-SMLP) that incorporates orthogonality constraints is proposed. Through hard constraints, P-SMLP enables end-to-end training without the need of alternating training between the two manifolds, providing a robust computational framework for generic PGIEPs. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

For this reason, we introduce a bootstrap iteration approach for elliptic equation on RN. The iteration is self-contained and can be regarded as a generalization of Agmon-Douglis-Nirenberg theorem. The proof characterizes iteration steps independent of the choice of the parameter, which are indeed manipulated by intrinsic natures of potentials and nonlinear terms, and furthermore presents precise estimates for asymptotically linear functions or continuous nonlinear terms restricted on a bounded domain in RN. Additionally, a comparison theorem for the spectrum of Schrodinger operator is also established in this paper. With above preparations, we can get a nontrivial solution without mountain pass geometry, and more importantly make an explicit description of nondegeneracy of solutions with monotonicity hypothesis.",

The proposed framework is flexible and efficient, allowing for the use of nonpolynomial approximating functions. The generalized weak differential operators are defined as an element-level correction of the classical differential operators accounting for boundary discontinuities. This construction reduces computational cost and provides greater flexibility than standard weak Galerkin formulations. The gWG framework naturally accommodates arbitrary finite-dimensional approximation spaces, including nonpolynomial activation-based spaces with randomly selected parameters. Error equations and error estimates are established for the proposed method. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the method is locking-free, robust with respect to mesh geometry, and effective on general polygonal and polyhedral partitions. In particular, activation-based interior approximation spaces exhibit convergence behavior comparable to that of classical polynomial spaces.",

Under the physically relevant condition on initial data $0 \\leq c_0 \\leq 1$, a maximum principle for the concentration is proved, yielding global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in two and three space dimensions. For higher regular initial data, we obtain the existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence of strong solutions. In this regime, the concentration decays exponentially to zero in $L^p$-norm for all $1 \\leq p \\leq \\infty$ with a uniform decay rate. In contrast, if $c_0 > 1$, we demonstrate the occurrence of finite-time blow-up of solutions and derive an explicit upper bound for the blow-up time.

We show that solutions initially close to a soliton converge, up to translation, weakly in $H^1(\\R)$ as time tends to infinity to a (possibly different) soliton. The analysis is based on a Liouville-type rigidity theorem characterizing solutions that remain localized near a soliton trajectory.\n  A central feature of the proof is a complete spectral resolution of the linearized CH operator around a soliton. This linear theory is obtained via the bi-Hamiltonian and integrable structure of the CH equation, through the recursion operator and the completeness of the associated squared eigenfunctions. It provides a substitute for the classical spectral framework used in KdV and gKdV equations, which is unavailable in the nonlocal and variable-coefficient setting of CH.\n  The spectral resolution yields sharp decay estimates for the linearized flow in exponentially weighted spaces, which in turn lead to the nonlinear rigidity result and the asymptotic stability of a single soliton. Combined with known orbital stability results, this approach extends to well-ordered trains of solitons and to the explicit multi-soliton solutions generated by the inverse scattering method. As an additional application, we revisit the linearized problems associated with other integrable dispersive equations, including the KdV and mKdV equations, from the perspective of squared-eigenfunction expansions.",

In the balanced case the associated exponential generating function satisfies a Pearson-type PDE, and solving by characteristics yields closed expressions in all drift regimes.

Locally this gives a Gaussian central window for the terminal-height distribution, while globally we identify an explicit limit cumulant generating function and prove an $n$-speed large-deviation principle. For finite $n$, Daniels' lattice saddlepoint approximation provides a single formula that is accurate across the full range of $k$; in all quadratic regimes it achieves a uniform interior relative error of order $n^{-1}$. The results link Pearson geometry with uniform saddlepoint methods and extend naturally to other weighted path models and tridiagonal recurrences.",

This set of data-driven basis consists of generalizations of prolate spheroidal wave functions to three dimensions (3D PSWFs), the main ingredients to explore a low-rank approximation of the inverse solution. We first establish the fundamentals of the inverse scattering analysis, including regularity in a customized Sobolev space and new a priori estimate. This is followed by a computational framework showcasing computing the 3D PSWFs and the low-rank approximation of the inverse solution. These results rely heavily on the fact that the 3D PSWFs are eigenfunctions of both a restricted Fourier integral operator and a Sturm-Liouville differential operator. Furthermore we propose a Tikhonov regularization method with a customized penalty norm and a localized imaging technique to image a targeting object despite the possible presence of its surroundings. Finally various numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the potential of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of extremal structures in mathematics requires navigating vast and nonconvex landscapes where analytical methods offer little guidance and brute-force search becomes intractable. We introduce FlowBoost, a closed-loop generative framework that learns to discover rare and extremal geometric structures by combining three components: (i) a geometry-aware conditional flow-matching model that learns to sample high-quality configurations, (ii) reward-guided policy optimization with action exploration that directly optimizes the generation process toward the objective while maintaining diversity, and (iii) stochastic local search for both training-data generation and final refinement. Unlike prior open-loop approaches, such as PatternBoost that retrains on filtered discrete samples, or AlphaEvolve which relies on frozen Large Language Models (LLMs) as evolutionary mutation operators, FlowBoost enforces geometric feasibility during sampling, and propagates reward signal directly into the generative model, closing the optimization loop and requiring much smaller training sets and shorter training times, and reducing the required outer-loop iterations by orders of magnitude, while eliminating dependence on LLMs. We demonstrate the framework on four geometric optimization problems: sphere packing in hypercubes, circle packing maximizing sum of radii, the Heilbronn triangle problem, and star discrepancy minimization. In several cases, FlowBoost discovers configurations that match or exceed the best known results. For circle packings, we improve the best known lower bounds, surpassing the LLM-based system AlphaEvolve while using substantially fewer computational resources.",

We formulate the problem as the Chebyshev approximation of matrices on the logarithmic scale by a common consistent matrix (a symmetrically reciprocal matrix of unit rank). We rearrange the approximation problem as a multi-objective optimization problem of finding a vector that determines the consistent matrix and hence yields a vector of ratings in question. The problem is then transformed into a series of optimization problems in the framework of tropical algebra, which focuses on the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. To solve the optimization problems, we apply methods and results of tropical optimization, which yield analytical solutions in a form ready for further analysis and straightforward computation. To illustrate the technique implemented, we give a numerical example of solving a known problem, and compare the obtained solution with results provided by classical methods of analytic hierarchy process and weighted geometrical means.",

Given the subsystems dynamics, the sets of admissible continuous and discrete control, the initial state and the time horizon, we present a new algorithm that, under certain conditions on the subsystems dynamics and the admissible control, designs maximum hands-off hybrid control sequences for the resulting switched system.

We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one bit of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one bit to all other users, (ii) hold at least one bit of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key bits. Our result establishes the fundamental performance limits of DSA and offers insights into the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols for distributed learning systems.",

The elliptic holonomy on $L^2X$ is defined by $\u03c4$-deformed equivariant twisted parallel transport on $LX$.

This paper studies PASS-enabled FL, where a radiating pinching antenna (PA) can be activated at an arbitrary position along a dielectric waveguide to reshape uplink latencies. We consider a joint optimization of PA placement and client participation to minimize the expected time-to-accuracy, coupling the exact expected maximum round latency via order statistics with a heterogeneity-aware convergence factor. We derive first-order optimality conditions that reveal an explicit tail-latency premium in the KKT recursion, quantifying how latency gaps are amplified by maximum-order-statistic synchronization. Under a latency-class structure, we obtain a within-class square-root sampling law and establish a two-class phase transition where slow-class participation collapses under an explicit heterogeneity-threshold condition as the per-round sample size grows. For PA placement, we prove a piecewise envelope-derivative characterization and provide an exact breakpoint-and-root candidate-enumeration procedure. Simulation results verify the theoretical findings and show that PASS enables more eligible participation, yielding higher wall-clock accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the exact controllability problem for multi-dimensional stochastic first-order symmetric hyperbolic systems with control inputs acting in two distinct ways: an internal control applied to the diffusion term and a boundary control applied to the drift term. By means of a classical duality argument, the controllability problem is reduced to an observability estimate for the corresponding backward stochastic system. The main technical contribution is the establishment of a new global Carleman estimate for such backward systems, combined with a weighted energy identity. This enables us to prove the desired observability inequality under a geometric structural condition (Condition \\ref{cond1}), which ensures that all characteristic rays propagate toward the boundary within a finite time. As a result, we obtain exact controllability provided the control time $T$ exceeds a sharp threshold $T_0$ given explicitly in terms of the system geometry. Furthermore, we complement the positive result with several negative controllability theorems, which demonstrate that both controls are necessary and must act in a distributed manner. Our analysis not only extends controllability theory from deterministic to stochastic multi-dimensional hyperbolic systems but also provides, as a byproduct, new results for deterministic systems under a structural hypothesis. Applications to stochastic traffic flow, epidemiological models, and shallow-water equations are discussed.",

We also provide a new multipartite generalization version and a $\u03a6$-mutual information analogue of the Zhang--Yeung inequality, which implies nontrivial points in the hypercontractivity ribbon and the $\u03a6$-ribbon respectively.

Although achieving high rates typically requires sufficiently large message sizes, smaller message sizes also desirable due to reduced implementation complexity and fewer constraints. By characterizing the capacity-achieving schemes, Tian, Sun, and Chen (2019) showed that the optimal message size for uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under no-collusion setting is $N-1$. However, comparable results are not yet available for more general collusion settings.\n  In this work, we present a complete characterization of the properties of capacity-achieving decomposable PIR schemes under arbitrary collusion patterns. Building on this characterization, we derive a general lower bound on the optimal message size for capacity-achieving uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\\mathcal{P}$, expressed in terms of the hitting number of a newly defined family of subsets of servers determined by the collusion pattern $\\mathcal{P}$. Finally, we specialize the lower bound to several important classes of collusion patterns, including $T$-collusion, disjoint collections of colluding sets, cyclically $T$-contiguous collusion, and disjoint collections of cyclically contiguous colluding sets. For the last two collusion patterns, we present matching achievable schemes that attain the corresponding bounds, thereby providing a complete characterization of the optimal message size.",

Algorithmically, the symplectic kernel predictor is combined with structure-preserving model order reduction, enabling efficient treatment of high-dimensional discretized PDEs. Numerical tests for a pendulum, a nonlinear spring--mass chain, and a semi-discrete wave equation show nearly algebraic greedy convergence and long-time trajectory errors reduce by two to three orders of magnitude compared to an implicit midpoint baseline at the same macro time step.",

To overcome this limitation, we introduce a refined analytical framework adapted to local couplings and derive explicit convergence estimates in terms of the exploitability and optimality gap. The key difficulty lies in establishing uniform bounds on the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman solutions; this is solved via the Cole--Hopf transformation under a standard quadratic Hamiltonian with a convection effect. We further provide numerical experiments demonstrating convergence behavior and confirming the theoretical rates. Additionally, the existence and uniqueness of smooth solutions to the MFG system with locally coupled interactions are established.",

The subject can be traced back to Viro's patchworking for constructing topological types of real algebraic curves. These two instances correspond to complex and real phases. Both fall into the category of what can be called \"abelian\" or classical tropicalization, referring to degenerations of varieties within an algebraic torus (or its compactification). In contrast, in \"non-abelian\" tropicalizations the ambient torus is replaced by a non-commutative group such as the special linear group. This is the beginning of a general theory valid for a wide array of coefficient systems and dimensions. As an application, the paper settles the question of phase tropicalization for the special linear group $\\mathrm{SL}_2$. It also gives an algebraic explanation and phase extension of the case of curves, previously studied in the purely geometric framework. To accomplish these tasks we introduce valuative tools that allow us to prove an affine version of Kapranov's theorem on tropical hypersurfaces and its generalization to arbitrary tropical varieties. Most notably, we show the functorial properties of the graded ring of a valuation and exhibit the polynomial structure of the graded ring of monomial valuations.",

The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\\infty} = \\prod_{n=1}^{\\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) \u03c3_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $\u03c3_p(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (\u03b6(2))^k/(\u0393(k) \u03b6(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions,\" and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.",

In this paper, we extend factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of non-negative-real-valued matrices that are based on running the sum-product algorithm (SPA) on standard normal factor graphs, to factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of complex-valued matrices that are based on running the SPA on double-edge normal factor graphs.\n  On the algorithmic side, we investigate the behavior of the SPA, in particular how the SPA fixed points change when transitioning from real-valued to complex-valued matrix ensembles. On the analytical side, we use graph covers to analyze the Bethe approximation of the permanent, i.e., the approximation of the permanent that is obtained with the help of the SPA.\n  This combined algorithmic and analytical perspective provides new insight into the structure of Bethe approximations in complex-valued problems and clarifies when such approximations remain meaningful beyond the non-negative-real-valued settings.",

We provide a sharp minimal time for the hyperbolic part (T > 2L) and a complete spectral characterization of exact controllability in weighted Hilbert spaces, whose definition depends explicitly on the coupling profile through a sequence of modal coefficients. In particular, internal couplings may generate nonstandard highly irregular controllability spaces and yield a generic (full measure) but non-robust controllability property. The analysis relies on Riesz basis decompositions and on an Ingham-M{\u00fc}ntz inequality. We also prove that the exact controllability space is not invariant along Hilbert Uniqueness Method trajectories: even if both endpoints belong to the controllability space, the associated minimal-energy trajectory may leave it at intermediate times. Finally, we compare with the reversed (heat-wave) cascade and discuss how reversing the direction of the coupling transfers the loss of regularity between the parabolic and hyperbolic components.",

We rigorously prove the equivalence between the OSC system and the original surface PDE on manifolds by embedding the latter into a narrow band domain. Using an intrinsic approach, we construct a time-continuous embedded PDE with push-forward operators in each chart of the atlas and establish its equivalence with the OSC system in the narrow band. Restricting the solution back to the manifold recovers the OSC system on manifolds, ensuring that the method introduces no operator splitting error.

Subsequently, a substantial line of work studied homomorphism indistinguishability over restricted graph classes. For example, homomorphism indistinguishability over minor-closed graph classes $\\mathcal{F}$ such as the class of planar graphs, the class of graphs of treewidth $\\leq k$, pathwidth $\\leq k$, or treedepth $\\leq k$, was shown to be equivalent to quantum isomorphism and equivalences with respect to counting logic fragments, respectively.\n  Via such characterisations, the distinguishing power of e.g. logical or quantum graph isomorphism relaxations can be studied with graph-theoretic means. In this vein, Roberson (2022) conjectured that homomorphism indistinguishability over every graph class excluding some minor is not the same as isomorphism. We prove this conjecture for all vortex-free graph classes. In particular, homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of bounded Euler genus is not the same as isomorphism. As a negative result, we show that Roberson's conjecture fails when generalised to graph classes excluding a topological minor.\n  Furthermore, we show homomorphism distinguishing closedness for several graph classes including all topological-minor-closed and union-closed classes of forests, and show that homomorphism indistinguishability over graphs of genus $\\leq g$ (and other parameters) forms a strict hierarchy.",

Peternell-Wi\u015bniewski and Hwang proved this conjecture up to dimension five in 1998, but Kanemitsu later disproved it in 2021. To address this gap in understanding, we present a method that aims to characterize the geometry associated with the maximal destabilizing sheaf of the tangent sheaf of a Fano variety. This approach utilizes modern advancements in the foliated minimal model program. In dimension two, our approach leads to a complete classification of $(-K)$-slope unstable weak del Pezzo surfaces with canonical singularities.

Our first main result shows how to `build' a Nash manifold with corners ${\\mathcal Q}\\subset{\\mathbb R}^n$ from a suitable Nash manifold $M\\subset{\\mathbb R}^n$ (of its same dimension), that contains ${\\mathcal Q}$ as a closed subset, by folding $M$ along the irreducible components of a normal-crossings divisor of $M$ (the smallest Nash subset of $M$ that contains the boundary $\\partial{\\mathcal Q}$ of ${\\mathcal Q}$). Our second main results shows that we can choose as the Nash manifold $M$ the Nash `double' $D({\\mathcal Q})$ of ${\\mathcal Q}$, which is the analogous to the Nash double of a Nash manifold with (smooth) boundary, but $D({\\mathcal Q})$ takes into account the peculiarities of the boundary of a Nash manifold with corners.\n  We propose several applications of the previous results: (1) Nash ramified coverings of closed semialgebraic sets, (2) Weak Nash uniformization of closed semialgebraic sets using Nash manifolds with (smooth) boundary, (3) Representation of compact semialgebraic sets connected by analytic paths as images under Nash maps of closed unit balls, (4) Explicit construction of Nash models for compact orientable smooth surfaces of genus $g\\geq0$, and (5) Nash approximation of continuous semialgebraic maps whose target spaces are Nash manifolds with corners.",

Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation and splitting its velocity as the MRI-observed one (considered a datum) plus an ``observation error'', a modified Navier-Stokes problem is derived. This procedure allows us to estimate the quality of the measured velocity fields, while also providing an alternative approach to pressure reconstruction, thereby avoiding invasive procedures. Since equal-order approximations have become a popular choice for problems linked to pressure recovery from MRI images, we design a stabilized finite element method allowing equal-order interpolations for velocity and pressure. In the linearized version of the resulting model, we prove stability and (optimal order) error estimates and test the method with a variety of numerical experiments testing both the linearized case and the more realistic nonlinear one.",

We provide a more compact characterization of these inequalities and show that each of them can be computed in linear time. Moreover, the proposed lifted inequalities, together with bound and GUB constraints, can completely characterize the convex hulls of the two sets, and can be separated using a combinatorial polynomial-time algorithm. Finally, computational results on probabilistic covering location and multiple probabilistic knapsack problems demonstrate the superiority of the proposed lifted inequalities over the EPIs within a branch-and-cut framework.",

A stratified discrete Morse function requires Forman's conditions on each stratum together with the requirement that closures of paired cells admit filtered collapses onto their shadows. We establish fundamental Morse lemmas: filtered collapses across regular intervals, and controlled attachments at critical values. For functions satisfying only the stratum-wise Forman condition, we construct an upper envelope on the barycentric subdivision whose local Morse data decomposes into horizontal and vertical components. This yields a simplicial analogue of the standard tangential-normal splitting of local Morse data in the sense of Goresky and MacPherson.",

    "abstract": "Given two graphs $H$ and $G$, an $H$-tiling is a family of vertex-disjoint copies of $H$ in $G$. A perfect $H$-tiling covers all vertices of $G$. The Corradi-Hajnal theorem (1963) states that an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree $\u03b4(G)\\ge 2n/3$ contains a perfect triangle-tiling. For an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with independence number $\u03b1(G)=o(n)$, Balogh, Molla and Sharifzadeh (Random Structures & Algorithms, 2016) showed that a minimum degree of $(\\frac12+o(1))n$ forces a perfect triangle-tiling. In a 2-edge-colored graph, Balogh, Freschi, Treglown (European J. Combin. 2026) determined the (asymptotic) minimum degree threshold for forcing a strong or weak monochromatic triangle-tiling covering a prescribed proportion of the vertices: a strong tiling requires all triangles to be in the same color class, while a weak tiling only requires each triangle to be monochromatic. In this paper, we combine the conditions from these two lines of work and prove that every $2$-edge-colored $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\u03b1(G)=o(n)$ contains a weak monochromatic triangle-tiling $\u0393$ of size \\[ |\u0393|\\ge \\begin{cases} 2\u03b4(G)-n-o(n), & \\text{if }\\frac12 n\\le \u03b4(G)\\le \\frac35 n,\\\\[2mm] \u03b4(G)/3-o(n), & \\text{if }\u03b4(G)>\\frac35 n. \\end{cases} \\] Both bounds are asymptotically optimal.

The ANM problem with MOV can be reformulated as a semidefinite program thanks to a Carath\u00e9odory--Fej\u00e9r-type decomposition for output covariance matrices of the G-filter. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the standard ANM and the G-filter version of ANM with a single output vector in recovering the correct number of frequency components when the frequencies fall within the band(s) selected by the G-filter, particularly in the low SNR regime.",

    "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are eminently suitable for wireless resource management, thanks to their scalability, but they still face computational challenges in large-scale, dense networks in classical computers. The integration of quantum computing with GNNs offers a promising pathway for enhancing computational efficiency because they reduce the model complexity. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum advantages of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), while retaining the expressive power of GNNs. However, existing pure quantum message passing models remain constrained by the limited number of qubits, hence limiting the scalability of their application to the wireless systems. As a remedy, we conceive a Scalable Quantum Message Passing Graph Neural Network (SQM-GNN) relying on a quantum message passing architecture. To address the aforementioned scalability issue, we decompose the graph into subgraphs and apply a shared PQC to each local subgraph. Importantly, the model incorporates both node and edge features, facilitating the full representation of the underlying wireless graph structure. We demonstrate the efficiency of SQM GNN on a device-to-device (D2D) power control task, where it outperforms both classical GNNs and heuristic baselines. These results highlight SQM-GNN as a promising direction for future wireless network optimization.",

    "abstract": "The stability of prepotential derivatives for Frobenius manifolds associated with A_N and D_N singularities has been utilized to construct (2+1)-dimensional dispersionless integrable hierarchies. Although the generalization of this construction to genus-zero Hurwitz-Frobenius manifolds was shown to yield the genus-zero Whitham hierarchy, a direct geometric explanation of this correspondence has been lacking. In this note, we provide a direct proof of this identification within the framework of infinite-dimensional Frobenius manifolds. We demonstrate that the stability of prepotentials is an intrinsic property of the tau-structure of the Whitham hierarchy. Furthermore, we extend this identification to the hierarchies arising from the stability of solutions to the open WDVV equations with the extensions of the Whitham hierarchy.",

Explicit bias and variance expansions are derived on compact subsets of the interior, yielding sharp mean squared error characterizations and optimal smoothing rates. The analysis shows that the proposed Poisson smoothing yields a non-negligible variance reduction relative to the empirical distribution function, leading to asymptotic efficiency gains that can be quantified through local and global deficiency measures. The behavior of the estimator near the boundary of its support is examined separately. Under a boundary-layer scaling that preserves nondegenerate Poisson smoothing as the evaluation point approaches the boundary of $[0,\\infty)^d$, bias and variance expansions are obtained that differ fundamentally from those in the interior region. In particular, the variance reduction mechanism disappears at leading order, implying that no asymptotically optimal smoothing parameter exists in the boundary regime. Central limit theorems and almost sure uniform consistency are also established. Together, these results provide a unified asymptotic theory for multivariate Sz\u00e1sz-Mirakyan distribution estimation and clarify the distinct roles of smoothing in the interior and boundary regions.",

We prove first that the solutions of an initial boundary value problem for the approximation recover the limiting NSCH system for vanishing relaxation parameters. To cope with the singular limit we exploit the fact that the approximate solutions dissipate an almost quadratic energy, and employ the relative entropy-framework. In the second part of the work we provide numerical evidence for the analytical results, even in flow regimes not covered by the assumptions needed for the theoretical results.

Existing convergence analysis largely focuses on Euler-Maruyama (EM)-like methods and does not extend to higher-order schemes, which are naturally expected to provide improved discretization accuracy. In this paper, we establish asymptotic 2-Wasserstein convergence results for SDE-based discretization methods employed in sampling for GDMs. We provide an all-at-once error bound analysis of the EM method that accounts for all error sources and establish convergence under all prevalent score-matching error assumptions in the literature, assuming a strongly log-concave data distribution. Moreover, we present the first error bound result for arbitrary higher-order SDE-discretization methods with known strong L_2 convergence in dependence on the discretization grid and the score-matching error. Finally, we complement our theoretical findings with an extensive numerical study, providing comprehensive experimental evidence and showing that, contrary to popular believe, higher order discretization methods can in fact retain their theoretical advantage over EM for sampling GDMs.",

    "abstract": "This work extends the application of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods to higher-order cell-centred finite-volume formulations for solid mechanics. While conventional schemes are typically limited to second-order accuracy, we present third- and fourth-order formulations employing local least-squares reconstructions for gradient evaluation and Gaussian quadrature at cell faces. These schemes enable accurate resolution of complex stress and deformation fields in linear and nonlinear solids while retaining the flexibility of finite-volume methods. A key contribution is a JFNK solution strategy for these higher-order schemes, eliminating the need to assemble complex Jacobian matrices. A compact-stencil approximate Jacobian is used as a preconditioner, providing efficiency gains similar to second-order frameworks. To enhance robustness on irregular meshes, an alpha-stabilisation scheme is incorporated, damping high-frequency error modes without compromising formal accuracy. The proposed methodology is benchmarked across a suite of two- and three-dimensional test problems involving elastic and nonlinear materials, where key performance metrics, including accuracy, computational cost, memory usage, and robustness, are systematically evaluated. Results confirm that the higher-order formulations deliver substantial accuracy improvements over second-order schemes, while the JFNK approach achieves strong performance with only minimal modifications to existing segregated frameworks. These findings underscore the potential of combining higher-order finite-volume methods with JFNK solvers to advance the state of the art in computational solid mechanics. The implementations are openly released in the solids4foam toolbox for OpenFOAM, supporting further exploration and adoption by the community.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation between satellite and terrestrial wireless networks promises great potential in meeting fast-growing demands for ubiquitous communications coverage. To tackle spectrum scarcity, spectrum sharing is studied for a hybrid satellite-terrestrial network where satellite links share the same group of time-slotted sub-carriers with terrestrial links opportunistically. In particular, with coarse network-wide time synchronization, a time-scale-adaptable spectrum sharing framework is proposed based on a satellite-terrestrial cooperation time scale that can be flexibly adjusted according to practical requirements. For generality, it is assumed that both full and partial frequency reuse could be adopted among the base stations (BSs) and satellite selection is supported when multiple satellites are available. Relying on only statistical channel state information (CSI), joint link scheduling and power control are explored to maximize the average sum rate of the network while ensuring quality of service (QoS) for users. To solve the complicated mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, a low-complexity spectrum sharing scheme is presented based on link-feature-sketching-aided hierarchical link clustering and Monte-Carlo-and-successive-approximation-aided transmit power optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that by link feature sketching, diversity of the links brought by the spatial distribution of the users could be well utilized. The proposed scheme promises a significant performance gain even under strict inter-link interference constraints.",

This set arises as a substructure in many mixed-integer nonlinear optimization models and encompasses, as special cases, several previously investigated mixed-integer sets, namely the submodular maximization set, the mixed-integer knapsack set, and the mixed-integer polyhedral conic set. We present the first comprehensive polyhedral study of conv($X$). In particular, we derive a class of seed inequalities for a two-dimensional restriction of $X$, obtained by fixing all but one of the $x$ variables to their bounds in $X$, and develop two lifting procedures to obtain strong valid inequalities for conv($X$). In the first lifting procedure, we derive a subadditive approximation for the exact lifting function of the seed inequalities, and lift all fixed variables in a single phase. In the second lifting procedure, we first lift variables fixed at their lower bounds before those at their upper bounds (and vice versa), using subadditive exact and approximation lifting functions, respectively. The derived single- and two-phase lifted inequalities are shown to be facet-defining for conv($X$) under mild conditions. Moreover, for the aforementioned special cases of conv($X$), we show that the proposed lifted inequalities can either unify existing strong valid inequalities or yield new facet-defining inequalities. Finally, extensive computational experiments on expected utility maximization and weapon-target assignment problems demonstrate that the proposed lifted inequalities can substantially strengthen the continuous relaxations and significantly improve the overall computational performance of branch-and-cut algorithms.",

Our approach combines two complementary TT-based strategies: the algebraic TTOpt method, which utilizes maximum volume sampling, and the probabilistic PROTES method, which employs generative sampling. A key innovation is the development of physically-constrained encoding schemes that incorporate molecular constraints directly into the discretization process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method by identifying global minima of Lennard-Jones clusters containing up to 45 atoms. Furthermore, we establish its practical applicability to real-world systems by optimizing 20-atom carbon clusters using a machine-learned Moment Tensor Potential, achieving geometries consistent with quantum-accurate simulations.

    "title": "Improvement of the Gilbert-Varshamov Bound for Linear Codes and Quantum Codes",
    "abstract": "The Gilbert--Varshamov (GV) bound is a central benchmark in coding theory, establishing existential guarantees for error-correcting codes and serving as a baseline for both Hamming and quantum fault-tolerant information processing. Despite decades of effort, improving the GV bound is notoriously difficult, and known improvements often rely on technically heavy arguments and do not extend naturally to the quantum setting due to additional self-orthogonality constraints.\n  In this work we develop a concise probabilistic method that yields an improvement over the classical GV bound for $q$-ary linear codes. For relative distance $\u03b4=d/n<1-1/q$, we show that an $[n,k,d]_q$ linear code exists whenever $\\frac{q^{k}-1}{q-1}\\;<\\;\\frac{c_\u03b4\\sqrt{n}\\, q^{n}}{\\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)}$, for positive constant $c_\u03b4$ depending only on $\u03b4$, where $\\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)$ denotes the volume of a $q$-ary Hamming ball.\n  We further adapt this approach to the quantum setting by analyzing symplectic self-orthogonal structures. For $\u03b4<1-1/q^2$, we obtain an improved quantum GV bound: there exists a $q$-ary quantum code $[[n,\\,n-k,\\,d]]$ provided that $\\frac{q^{2n-k}-1}{q-1}<\\frac{c_\u03b4\\sqrt{n}\\cdot q^{2n}}{\\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\\binom{n}{i}(q^2-1)^i}$. In particular, our result improves the standard quantum GV bound by an $\u03a9(\\sqrt{n})$ multiplicative factor.",

    "abstract": "Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit sharp gradients or local singularities is computationally demanding, as traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often suffer from inefficient point allocation that wastes resources on regions already well-resolved. This paper presents an adaptive sampling framework for PINNs aimed at efficiently solving time-dependent partial differential equations with pronounced local singularities. The method employs a residual-driven strategy, where the spatial-temporal distribution of training points is iteratively updated according to the error field from the previous iteration. This targeted allocation enables the network to concentrate computational effort on regions with significant residuals, achieving higher accuracy with fewer sampling points compared to uniform sampling. Numerical experiments on representative PDE benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach improves solution quality.",

While martingale estimators are easier to analyze, they are far from optimal, especially in pull-based update systems, where maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are known to be optimal, but are analytically challenging. In this work, we introduce a new class of estimators called $p$-MAP estimators, which enable us to model the MAP estimator as a piecewise constant function with finitely many stages, bringing us closer to a full characterization of the MAP estimators when modeling information freshness.",

A new variational formulation is derived involving solely the velocity, pressure, and phase field, together with corresponding a priori energy estimates. The spatial discretization is based on the coupling divergence-free and $C^1$-conforming elements of high-order, while the time discretization employs a classical backward Euler scheme. By introducing a novel skew-symmetric trilinear form to discretize the convective term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation, we propose discrete schemes that satisfy mass conservation and energy bounds. Moreover, optimal error estimates are provided for both formulations. Finally, two numerical experiments are presented to support our theoretical findings and to illustrate the good performance of the proposed schemes for different polynomial degrees and polygonal meshes.",

Our technique consists of obtaining an approximating Laurent polynomial $L$ to $F$ by interpolation in the Hermite sense in a collection of these points that mimic the zeros of a para-orthogonal polynomial with respect to $\u03bc$, and to use the values of $F$ at the remaining nodes to improve the accuracy of the approximation by a process of simultaneous complex regression.

    "abstract": "Dynamic Low Rank (DLR) methods are a promising way to reduce the computational cost and memory footprint of the high-dimensional thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations. The TRT equations are a system of nonlinear PDEs that model the energy exhchange between the material temperature and the radiation energy density; due to their high dimensionality, solving the TRT equations is often bottleneck in multi-physics simulations. DLR methods represent the solution in terms of time-evolving SVD-like factors of angle and space. Although previous work has explored DLR methods for TRT, most of the methods have limitations that make them impractical for realistic scenarios and uncompetitive with current non-DLR production codes.\n  Here we develop new PN-like and SN-like Dynamic Low Rank (DLR) methods for TRT. In the SN-like DLR method, we use the time-evolving angular basis functions to select time-evolving angles; this DLR formulation enables us to use the highly optimized SN transport sweep as our main computational kernel, and results in a practical way of leveraging low-rank methods in production TRT codes. In contrast, our PN-like DLR method uses an even-parity formulation and results in positive-definite linear systems to solve for each time step.\n  We demonstrate the methods on several challenging, highly heterogenous problems in two spatial dimensions $(4$D) that these DLR schemes can give significant reduction in angular artifacts (``ray effects'') with the same cost as gold-standard SN methods.",

Specifically, given observations $Y_i\\sim f(\\cdot; \u03b8_i)$ with latent parameters $\u03b8_i\\sim \u03c0$, the goal is to estimate $\\mathbb{E}_\u03c0[\\ell(\u03b8)|X = x]$. This task lies between classical deconvolution (recovering the full prior $\u03c0$), and standard empirical Bayes mean estimation. While the minimax risk for estimating $\u03c0$ in the Wasserstein distance is known to decay only logarithmically, we show that estimating certain smooth functions admits dramatically faster rates. In particular, for polynomial functions of degree $k$ in the Poisson model, we establish a tight bound of $\u0398(\\frac{1}{n}(\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n})^{k+1})$ and $\u0398(\\frac{1}{n}(\\log n)^{2k+1})$ for bounded and subexponential priors, respectively, attainable by estimators mimicking those that achieve optimal regret for the mean estimation problem (Robbins, mininum distance, ERM). Our analysis identifies the approximation-theoretic origin of this improvement: smooth functions can be well-approximated by low-degree polynomials, whereas Lipschitz functions require dense polynomial approximations, incurring a $\\frac{1}{k}$ loss for degree $k$ polynomial approximation. The results reveal a sharp hierarchy in the difficulty of empirical Bayes problems: ranging from slow, logarithmic deconvolution to near-parametric convergence for smooth posterior functionals, and establish new connections between nonparametric empirical Bayes theory, polynomial approximation, and statistical inverse problems. Finally, we complement our analysis with a lower bound of $\u03a9(\\frac 1n (\\frac{\\log n}{\\log \\log n})^{k+1})$ (bounded priors) and $\u03a9(\\frac 1n (\\log n)^{k + 1})$ (subgaussian priors) for the normal means model.",

Shapiro described log-canonical coordinates on this symplectic groupoid via the $\\mathcal{A}_n$-quiver. In this paper, we introduce a birational Weyl group action on the symplectic groupoid. It is generated by cluster transformations associated with certain cycles of the quiver. We prove that every matrix entry of $\\mathcal{A}_n$ is invariant under this action. Conversely, we prove that matrix entries generate the Poisson subalgebra of Weyl group invariants in the ring of regular functions on the cluster variety $\\mathcal X_{|\\mathcal A_n|}$.\n  V.

The solution set of the rank condition has distinct irreducible components, so the reduction might be component-dependent. However, we show that the Weyl group acts transitively on these components. This implies that the Hamiltonian reductions are conjugate; thus, it suffices to determine the reduction on a single component.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the longest element of the Weyl group corresponds to a cluster DT-transformation on the $\\mathcal{A}_{2k}$-quiver.

In particular, we provide practically verifiable conditions for several linear models, including Rao's mixed-effects model, a seemingly unrelated regression model, first-order spatial autoregressive and spatial moving average models, and serial correlation models.

This is equivalent to the problem of counting multivariate polynomials over a finite field with prescribed degree, coefficients, and number of zeroes. We provide a solution to this problem using the character sum method, which offers a new unified framework applicable to a broad class of polynomial enumeration problems over finite fields that involve prescribed evaluation vectors.\n  This work effectively makes the first systematic attempt to study the coset weight distribution problem for Reed-Muller codes of fixed degree over large finite fields, which was proposed in MacWilliams and Sloane's 1977 textbook \\emph{The Theory of Error Correcting Codes}.",

    "title": "Balancing Privacy and Robustness in Coded Computing Under Profiled Workers",
    "abstract": "In distributed computing with untrusted workers, the assignment of evaluation indices plays a critical role in determining both privacy and robustness. In this work, we study how the placement of unreliable workers within the Numerically Stable Lagrange Coded Computing (NS-LCC) framework influences privacy and the ability to localize Byzantine errors. We derive analytical bounds that quantify how different evaluation-index assignments affect privacy against colluding curious workers and robustness against Byzantine corruption under finite-precision arithmetic. Using these bounds, we formulate optimization problems that identify privacy-optimal and robustness-optimal index placements and show that the resulting assignments are fundamentally different. This exposes that index choices that maximizes privacy degrade error-localization, and vice versa. To jointly navigate this trade-off, we propose a low-complexity greedy assignment strategy that closely approximates the optimal balance between privacy and robustness.",

    "abstract": "For fixed natural numbers $r$ and $s$, where $2\\leq s \\leq r$, we consider a representation of numbers from the interval $[0;\\frac{r}{s-1}]$ obtained by encoding numbers by means of the alphabet $A=\\{0,1,...,r\\}$ via the expansion $x=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}s^{-n}\u03b1_n=\u0394^{r_s}_{\u03b1_1\u03b1_2...\u03b1_n...}.$ The algorithm for expanding a number into such a series is justified in the paper. The geometry of this representation is studied, including the geometric meaning of digits, properties of cylinder sets -- particularly the specificity of their overlaps -- and metric relations, as well as the connection between the representation and partial sums of the corresponding series.\n  The paper also presents results on the study of a function $f$ defined by $f(x=\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{\u03b1_n}{(r+1)^n})=\u0394^{r_s}_{\u03b1_1\u03b1_2...\u03b1_n...}, \u03b1_n\\in A.$ It is proved that the function $f$ is continuous at every point that has a unique representation in the classical numeration system with base $r+1$, and discontinuous at points having two representations. The function has unbounded variation and a self-affine graph. For $r<2s-1$, the function possesses singleton, finite, countable, and continuum level sets, including fractal ones; for $r>2s-2$, every level set is a continuum, and moreover it is fractal or anomalously fractal.",

The existence and uniqueness of such cones is proved by solving a nonlinear free boundary equation parametrized by the contact angle and obtaining monotonicity properties for the solutions. The constructed cones are minimizing in ambient dimension $8$ or higher, for appropriate contact angles, demonstrating that the regularity theory for minimizing capillary hypersurfaces can have singularities in codimension $7$ and completing the capillary regularity theory for contact angles near $\u03c0/2$. We further develop the connection between capillary hypersurfaces and solutions of the one-phase problem, consequently producing new examples of singular minimizing free boundaries for the Alt-Caffarelli functional.",

This is known to be the case for palettes of only two colours, or when $H$ is only a single edge. We answer the above question in full, finding an $H$-factor which is at most $C_{r,k}$ edges away from being balanced, where $C_{r,k}$ depends only on $r$ and $k$. In fact, we work in the more general setting wherein our palette of colours is a subset of $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, and find an $H$-factor where the sum of the colours of all edges has bounded Euclidean norm.",

Among other results, we prove that proper PAC learning from positive information is equivalent to the limit operation on Baire space, whereas improper PAC learning from positive information is closely related to Weak K\u0151nig's Lemma and even equivalent to it, when we have some negative information about the admissible hypotheses. If arbitrary hypotheses are allowed, then improper PAC learning from positive information is still in a finitary DNC range, which implies that it is non-deterministically computable, but does not allow for probabilistic algorithms. These results can also be seen as a classification of the degree of constructivity of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning. All the aforementioned results hold if an upper bound of the VC dimension is provided as an additional input information. We also study the question of how these results are affected if the VC dimension is not given, but only promised to be finite or if concept classes are represented by negative or full information. Finally, we also classify the complexity of the VC dimension operation itself, which is a problem that is of independent interest. For positive or full information it turns out to be equivalent to the binary sorting problem, for negative information it is equivalent to the jump of sorting. This classification allows also conclusions regarding the Borel complexity of PAC learnability.",

Consecutive temporal modes are coupled by a passive orthogonal rotation that redistributes the displacement amplitude between slots, yielding a diversity order of two under independent fading and joint maximum-likelihood detection. Analytical expressions for the symbol-error rate performance, along with asymptotic results for the diversity and coding gains, are derived. The optimal rotation angle and energy allocation between displacement and squeezing are obtained in closed form. Furthermore, we show that when both the displacement amplitude and the squeezing strength scale with the total photon number, an effective diversity order of four is achieved. Numerical results validate the analysis and demonstrate the super-diversity behaviour of the proposed QRD scheme.",
