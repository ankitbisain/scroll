The approach proceeds in three stages: first, existing neural network models are employed to compute an approximate Ricci-flat metric on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Second, using this metric and the explicit construction of a $\\mathrm{G}_2$-structure on the associated 7-dimensional Calabi-Yau link in the 9-sphere, numerical approximations of the 3-form are generated on a large set of sampled points. Finally, a dedicated neural architecture is trained to learn the 3-form and its induced Riemannian metric directly from data, validating the learned structure and its torsion via a numerical implementation of the exterior derivative, which may be of independent interest.",

Within the framework of splitting Gibbs measures, we derive the exact boundary-law compatibility equations and characterize translation-invariant splitting Gibbs measures (TISGMs) via a finite system of algebraic relations. In the ferromagnetic regime $J>0$, writing $\u03b8=\\exp(\u03b2J/2)$, we further reduce the translation-invariant problem to a one-dimensional scalar fixed-point equation $x=f(x,\u03b8,k)$ for a rational map $f$. We show that $f$ is strictly increasing and obtain an explicit sufficient condition for phase coexistence: if $s_k(\u03b8)=f'(1,\u03b8,k)-1>0$, then $x=f(x,\u03b8,k)$ admits at least three distinct positive solutions, yielding at least three distinct TISGMs and hence a phase transition driven by the periodic inhomogeneity of the spin structure.\n  For the binary tree $k=2$ we exploit attractiveness to construct plus and minus Gibbs measures as weak limits with extremal boundary conditions, prove that they are TISGMs corresponding to the minimal and maximal fixed points of $f(\\cdot,\u03b8,2)$, and show that they are the minimal and maximal Gibbs measures in the natural stochastic order. Finally, we construct the tree-indexed Markov chain associated with a TISGM and apply the Kesten--Stigum criterion to the disordered TISGM, identifying nonempty parameter regions where this measure is non-extremal and reconstruction occurs.",

    "abstract": "In network epidemic models, controlling the spread of a disease often requires targeted interventions such as vaccinating high-risk individuals based on network structure. However, typical approaches assume complete knowledge of the underlying contact network, which is often unavailable. While network structure can be learned from observed epidemic dynamics, existing methods require long observation windows that may delay critical interventions.\n  In this work, we show that full network reconstruction may not be necessary: control-relevant features, such as high-degree vertices (super-spreaders), can be learned far more efficiently than the complete structure. Specifically, we develop an algorithm to identify such vertices from the dynamics of a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) process. We prove that in an $n$-vertex graph, vertices of degree at least $n^\u03b1$ can be identified over an observation window of size $\u03a9(1/\u03b1)$, for any $\u03b1\\in (0,1)$. In contrast, existing methods for exact network reconstruction requires an observation window that grows linearly with $n$. Simulations demonstrate that our approach accurately identifies super-spreaders and enables effective epidemic control.",

To our knowledge, this is the first instance-dependent sample complexity bound for finding an NE estimate with $\\varepsilon$ bias in general-dimension matrix games with noisy feedback and potentially non-unique equilibria. Our algorithm builds on recent advances in online resource allocation and operates in two stages: (1) identifying the support set of an NE, and (2) computing the unique NE restricted to this support. Both stages rely on a careful analysis of LP solutions derived from noisy samples.",

First, we consider the optimal control problem that each agent aims to solve when the evolution of the population is given and we establish some properties as: the existence of an optimal trajectory for any starting point $(x,t)$, the closed graph property for the multivalued map which associates to each point $(x,t)$ the set of optimal trajectories starting from that point, endowed with a suitable notion of convergence, the continuity of the value function. The main issue to overcome is due to the local interplay at boundary points between the set of state constraints and the degenerate dynamics. To this end, we shall point out two different sets of assumptions which are both sufficient for these properties. Afterwards, we tackle the mean field games; taking advantage of the aforementioned properties, we prove the existence of a relaxed equilibrium (which describes the evolution of the game in terms of a probability on the set of admissible trajectories) and derive the existence of a mild solution (which is a couple formed by the value function for the generic player and a family of time dependent measures on the state).",

We first present the underlying mathematical model, which is based on a recently derived formulation involving, in particular, only first order in time derivatives. We then propose a spacetime discontinuous Galerkin discretization of this model, combining a symmetric Friedrichs systems discretization for symmetric hyperbolic systems with an interior penalty discretization for damping terms. The resulting nonlinear system is solved using Newton's method. Next, we present a well-posedness analysis of the discrete problem. The analysis begins with a linearized system, for which stability is shown. Using a fixed point argument, these results are extended to the fully discrete nonlinear system, yielding a priori error estimates in a natural discontinuous Galerkin norm. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the parallel solvability of the spacetime formulation and the effectiveness of p-adaptivity. The results confirm the theoretical convergence rates and show that adaptive refinement can reduce the number of degrees of freedom required to accurately approximate selected goal functionals. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that the model reproduces characteristic phenomena of nonlinear acoustics, such as harmonic generation, thereby validating the proposed model.",

We find solutions to this zero-mass problem in a Coulomb-Sobolev space using a new scaling based approach in critical point theory, by which we classify the possibly different behaviour of the nonlinearity $f$ at zero and at infinity in terms of the scaling properties of the left hand side of the equation. This is accomplished identifying a scaling invariant PDE which can be interpreted as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem, for which a sequence of eigenvalues $\\{\u03bb_k\\}$ is conveniently defined via the ${\\mathbb{Z}}_2$-cohomological index of Fadell and Rabinowitz. This index allows us to use new critical group estimates (and scaling-based linking sets) which might not be possible via the classical genus. Within a fairly broad set of parameters $N,\u03b1, p$ and class of assumptions on the local nonlinearity $f,$ we establish compactness results for an associated action functional and find multiple solutions as critical points, whose existence and number is sensitive to the ''resonance'' of $f$ with the sequence of eigenvalues for the scaling invariant problem, a construction which is at places reminiscent, in the present nonlinear setting, of the classical Fredholm alternative.

This approach unifies and simplifies continuity proofs, because the group operations become coordinatewise and standard topological-group methods apply. We organize the theory in a standard ``definitions--characterizations--properties--examples'' format. In particular, we (i) record the induced topology and induced bitopology on soft elements of a soft set; (ii) characterize soft bitopological groups by continuity of the map $(a,b)\\mapsto a\\ast b^{-1}$ in each induced topology; (iii) show that translations and inversion are homeomorphisms in each induced topology; (iv) collect pairwise soft separation axioms and pairwise soft compactness results (including the finiteness principle for compactness when the parameter set is finite); and (v) define soft bitopological group homomorphisms and basic invariants.

This proposed scheme exhibits three fundamental characteristics: structure preservation, numerical stability, and first-order accuracy in time. In practical implementations, the scheme not only ensures stable computation and adheres to the norm constraint but also guarantees the uniqueness of the numerical solution, thereby providing substantial facilitation for the theoretical analysis of the normalizing step.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that square matrices with independent and identically distributed (iid) random entries are typically well conditioned. A natural question is whether this favorable behavior persists for random matrices whose entries obey additional structure, i.e., their position inside of the matrix. A prominent class of structured matrices is given by {\\it Toeplitz matrices}, characterized by constant diagonals. A particular tractable subclass is that of circulant matrices, whose additional characteristic (its entries {\\it circulate} row by row) allows one to express their conditioning in terms of the localization of the zeros of a associated polynomial. When the entries of a circulant matrix are iid, the matrix is well conditioned precisely when the corresponding random polynomial has no zeros on the unit circle. This connection is especially relevant because, as the degree of a random polynomial increases, its zeros tend to concentrate near the unit circle, making it a delicate problem to quantify how close the closest zeros lie to the unit circle. Another notable family within the Toeplitz class is that of {\\it banded Toeplitz matrices}, namely matrices for which only finitely many diagonals around the main diagonal may be nonzero. These matrices have been extensively studied in Operator Theory, nevertheless, despite their apparent simplicity, they raise subtle questions regarding the behavior of their condition numbers. In present work we show that the bandwidth asymmetry plays a decisive role: if the band contains $r$ diagonals below and $s$ diagonal above the main diagonal, then if $r=s$ the banded Toeplitz matriz is well conditioned with high probability, whereas if $r\\neq s$ it is typically ill conditioned. This highlights that structural constraints can have a impact on the numerical behavior of random matrices.",

We then review early rigorous milestones, including high-temperature results and stability identities, and describe the consolidation of interpolation and cavity methods through the work of Guerra and of Aizenman-Sims-Starr. The central event in this narrative is Talagrand's 2006 proof of the Parisi formula for the SK model and for a broad class of mixed $p$-spin models, and his subsequent analysis of Parisi measures. We also discuss Talagrand's later program constructing pure states under extended Ghirlanda-Guerra identities and an atom at the maximal overlap, together with the structural results that followed, notably Panchenko's ultrametricity theorem and extensions of the Parisi formula.

Such a limiter is inexpensive to evaluate, with a feature that the corresponding BP CFL conditions depend solely on the first-order sub-cell schemes. A mild CFL restriction is derived under which high-order spatial accuracy is retained. The proposed BP schemes are extend to two nonlinear systems, namely, the Euler equations and the five-equation transport model of two-medium flows.

For the case $J \\neq m_L$, where $m_L$ denotes the multiplicative order of $q$ modulo $L$, we show that the proposed MRD codes, in a family of settings, are different from any Gabidulin code and any twisted Gabidulin code. For the case $J = m_L$, we prove that every constructed $(J \\times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD code coincides with a $(J \\times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ Gabidulin code, yielding an equivalent circular-shift-based construction that operates directly over $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In addition, we prove that under some parameter settings, the constructed MRD codes are equivalent to a generalization of Gabidulin codes obtained by summing and concatenating several $(m_L \\times n, q^{m_Lk}, d)$ Gabidulin codes. When $q=2$, $L$ is prime and $n\\leq m_L$, it is analyzed that generating a codeword of the proposed $((L-1) \\times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ MRD codes requires $O(nkL)$ exclusive OR (XOR) operations, while generating a codeword of $((L-1) \\times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ Gabidulin codes, based on customary construction, requires $O(nkL^2)$ XOR operations.",

    "abstract": "Differential Privacy (DP) provides a rigorous framework for deriving privacy-preserving estimators by injecting calibrated noise to mask individual contributions while preserving population-level insights. Its central challenge lies in the privacy-utility trade-off: calibrating noise levels to ensure robust protection without compromising statistical performance. Standard DP methods struggle with a particular class of two-stage problems prevalent in individualized treatment rules (ITRs) and causal inference. In these settings, data-dependent weights are first computed to satisfy distributional constraints, such as covariate balance, before the final parameter of interest is estimated. Current DP approaches often privatize stages independently, which either degrades weight efficacy-leading to biased and inconsistent estimates-or introduces excessive noise to account for worst-case scenarios.\n  To address these challenges, we propose the Differentially Private Two-Stage Empirical Risk Minimization (DP-2ERM), a framework that injects a carefully calibrated noise only into the second stage while maintaining privacy for the entire pipeline and preserving the integrity of the first stage weights. Our theoretical contributions include deterministic bounds on weight perturbations across various widely used weighting methods, and probabilistic bounds on sensitivity for the final estimator. Simulations and real-world applications in ITR demonstrate that DP-2ERM significantly enhances utility over existing methods while providing rigorous privacy guarantees.",

    "abstract": "A widely used mathematical model for the bouncing motion of an ideally elastic ball -- referred to in previous work by the first two authors and collaborators as a {\\em no-slip billiard} system -- exhibits some notable dynamical behavior that is not well-understood. For example, under certain initial conditions, the axial component of the position of the center of the ball moving inside a vertical solid cylinder under constant gravitational force does not accelerate downward as might be expected but remains bounded. There is not as yet, as far as we know, any analytical study of the bouncing ball dynamics, under gravity, in general cylinders (not necessarily having a circular cross-section) in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. In this paper, we propose an approach by comparing the no-slip system with a smooth approximation of it that we call {\\em nonholonomic billiards}. It consists of a $4$-dimensional ball rolling on the solid $3$-dimensional cylinder.\n  We first review earlier work on no-slip billiards and their connection with nonholonomic (rolling) systems, explain how nonholonomic billiards approximate the no-slip kind (after work by the first two authors and B. Zhao), and illustrate the relationship with a few numerical case studies that demonstrate the utility of the soft (nonholonomic) system as a helpful tool for exploring the dynamics of no-slip billiard systems.",

    "abstract": "Channel State Information (CSI) provides a detailed description of the wireless channel and has been widely adopted for Wi-Fi sensing, particularly for high-precision indoor positioning. However, complete CSI is rarely available in real-world deployments due to hardware constraints and the high communication overhead required for feedback. Moreover, existing positioning models lack mechanisms to detect when users move outside their trained regions, leading to unreliable estimates in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions. Experimental results using standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi hardware show that FPNet achieves positioning accuracy above 97% with only 100 feedback bits, boosts net throughput by up to 22.92%, and attains AD accuracy over 99% with a false alarm rate below 1.5%. These results demonstrate FPNet's ability to deliver efficient, accurate, and reliable indoor positioning on commodity Wi-Fi devices.",

Simulating this system presents a fundamental challenge: while the outer boundary evolves via advection, the inner necrotic interface is defined by an obstacle problem and lacks an explicit advection structure, causing standard schemes to fail. To address this, we introduce a stabilized predictor-corrector strategy that iteratively resolves the bidirectional coupling between the nutrient-pressure fields and the domain geometry, ensuring robust time-stepping for both the advection-driven outer surface and the obstacle-defined necrotic core. We establish rigorous convergence theory for the single-interface case and demonstrate the method's robustness in capturing the topological transition of necrotic core nucleation and complex geometric evolution.",

We then derive formulae for the Laplace transform of the entire rank-4 linear system associated to such an immersed surface, obtaining explicit formulae for the rank-4 systems that define the Laplace transformed surfaces. We apply our results to study the geometry of surfaces defined by Appell's hypergeometric functions of rank-4, namely the functions $F_2$ and $F_4$. We show that the sequence of Laplace invariants for each is determined respectively by the Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation in the case of $F_2$, and Darboux's Harmonic equation in the case of $F_4$. Further, we show that for all parameter values of the hypergeometric functions, the natural line congruences generated by the Laplace transforms of the surfaces determined by either $F_2$ or $F_4$ constitute a $W$-congruence, an important example of line congruence.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes an efficient method for modeling and reconstructing the channel gain map (CGM) based on virtual scatterers. Specifically, we develop a virtual scatterer model to characterize the channel power gain distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space, by capturing the multi-path propagation environment structure and exploiting the angular-domain spatial correlation of scatterer response. In this model, the CGM is represented as a function over a set of tunable parameters for virtual scatterers, including their number, positions, and scatterer response coefficients (SRCs), which can be estimated from a limited number of channel power gain measurements at a given set of locations within the region of interest. This new representation offers a flexible and scalable modeling framework for efficient and accurate CGM reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a progressive estimation algorithm to acquire the scatterers' parameters. In this algorithm, we gradually increase the number of virtual scatterers to balance the computational complexity and estimation accuracy. In addition, by exploiting the spatial correlation of scatterer response, we propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based inference method to predict the SRCs that cannot be directly estimated. Finally, ray-tracing-based simulation results under realistic physical environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it achieves higher reconstruction accuracy compared to conventional CGM estimation approaches.",

We term this the \\emph{HOMFLYPT difference module}, which captures relations between the colored HOMFLYPT polynomials of different antisymmetric colorings.

This pattern for reduction to depth zero fits well with the conjectural (categorical) local Langlands correspondence.\n  When $G$ is tamely ramified and $p$ does not divide the order of its Weyl group, then the above Serre subcategories provide the block decomposition of the category of all smooth $\\overline{\\mathbb{Z}}[\\frac{1}{p}]$-representations of $G(F)$.

The Maxwell--Boltzmann distribution is exact only in the thermodynamic limit, where the system is composed of infinitely many particles as N approaches infinity. For an isolated system with a finite number of particles, the equilibrium velocity distribution is compact and markedly non-Gaussian, being restricted by the fixed total energy. Using Stein's method, we first obtain a differential operator that characterises the target density. Its eigenfunctions are symmetric Jacobi polynomials, whose orthogonality yields a simple, parameter-free statistic. Under the null hypothesis that the data follows the finite-N distribution, the statistic converges to a chi-squared law, so critical values are available in closed form. Large-scale Monte Carlo experiments confirm exact size control and give a clear picture of the power. These findings quantify how quickly a finite system approaches the classical limit and provide a practical tool for testing kinetic models in regimes where normality cannot be assumed.",

We assume that the sequencing channel is symmetric and choose the inner coding scheme to be composed by a linear block code and a zero-undetected-error decoder. As a byproduct, the resulting optimal maximum-likelihood decoder land itself for an amenable analysis, and we are able to derive an achievability bound for the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. As a result of independent interest, we prove that the average error probability of random linear block codes under zero-undetected-error decoding converges to zero exponentially fast with the block length, as long as its coding rate does not exceed some critical value, which is known to serve as a lower bound to the zero-undetected-error capacity.",

Second, for non-integer $\u03b1$ the cones $\\mathsf P_\u03b1$ fail stability under CP post-composition, highlighting a sharp structural transition away from the integer theory.

For completing this task, the role of one-dimensional generating spaces (a.k.a. singletons) is found to be useful. We are particularly interested in classifying bicovariant codifferential calculi, which we define over Hopf algebras. This, in turn, can be reduced to classifying Yetter-Drinfeld submodules.

If the matrix is positive/negative definite (i.e., the surface of integration is an ellipsoid) and $S$ is strictly convex, we prove that the singularities are folds. If the matrix is indefinite (i.e., the surface of integration is a hyperboloid-type quadric) and $S$ is either strictly convex or a cylinder, then cusp, fold, or blowdown singularities are present. We also study the case when the surface of integration is a paraboloid and show that the Bolker condition is satisfied.",

    "abstract": "Energy-based finite-element formulations provide a unified framework for describing complex physical systems in computational mechanics. In these energy-based methods, the governing equations can be obtained directly by considering the derivatives of a single global energy functional. While Automatic Differentiation (AD) can be used to automate the generation of these derivatives, current frameworks face a clear trade-off based primarily on the scale upon which the AD method is applied. Globally applied AD offers high expressivity but cannot currently be scaled to large problems. Locally applied AD scales well through traditional assembly methods, but the variety of physics and couplings that the framework can easily represent is more limited than the global approach. Here, we introduce an energy-centric framework tatva (https://github.com/smec-ethz/tatva) that defines the physics of a problem as a single global functional and applies AD globally to generate residual and tangent operators. By leveraging Jacobian-vector products for matrix-free solvers and coloring-based sparse differentiation for materializing sparse tangent stiffness matrices when needed, our flexible design scales linearly with the problem size on GPUs. We demonstrate that our framework can handle large problems (with millions of degrees of freedom) without memory exhaustion. Additionally, it offers a unified, fully differentiable methodology that can address a wide range of problems, including multi-point constraints, mixed-dimensional coupling, and the incorporation of neural networks, while maintaining high performance and scalability on modern GPU architectures.",

    "abstract": "Power system operators routinely perform N-1 contingency analysis, yet conventional tools provide limited guidance on which lines or transformers deserve heightened attention during fast post-fault transients. In particular, static screening does not reveal whether (1) the same faulted line repeatedly triggers severe downstream overloads, or (2) a specific transformer emerges as vulnerable across many distinct fault scenarios. This paper introduces a real-time dynamic N-1 screening framework that addresses this gap by estimating, for each counterfactual single-phase transmission fault, the probability of transient overcurrent on critical grid elements. The output is an operator-facing dashboard that ranks (a) faulted lines whose outages most frequently lead to dangerous transformer overloads, and (b) transformers that consistently overload across top-risk scenarios, both of which are actionable indicators for real-time situational awareness. The approach models post-fault electromechanical dynamics using a linear stochastic formulation of the swing equations with short-lived, fault-localized uncertainty, and combines analytic transient evaluation with cross-entropy based importance sampling to efficiently estimate rare but high-impact events. All N-1 contingencies are evaluated in parallel with linear computational complexity. The framework is demonstrated on the IEEE 118-bus system, where it reveals latent high-risk lines and transformers that remain invisible under deterministic dynamic or static N-1 analysis. Results show orders-of-magnitude computational speedup relative to brute-force Monte Carlo, enabling practical deployment within real-time operational cycles.",

A recently introduced feedforward network-based approach can simultaneously enhance a signal while steering a radiating beam in radio frequency communication systems. Furthermore, the approach is also model-independent, thus making it suitable for other applications. In this work, we aim to understand the effects of inhomogeneities in feedforward arrays, which are inevitable in real-world implementations. We investigate a collection of two-cell feedforward networks composed of pitch-fork cells and Stuart-Landau oscillators and quantify the effects of parameter inhomogeneities using system reduction, analytical and computational bifurcation analyses, and a singularity theory approach. Contrary to common intuition, inhomogeneity in the excitation parameter can be exploited to enhance the network output growth rate. While frequency inhomogeneity in Stuart-Landau networks primarily has an adverse effect on signal amplification, phase locking persists over a surprisingly broad range of inhomogeneity.",

    "abstract": "A flip of a graph is obtained by complementing the edge relation within a set of vertices. Flips are typically used to separate vertices in a graph, by increasing the distances between them. We show that in $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, every short sequence of flips can be simulated by a short sequence of vertex deletions that achieves a similar degree of separation: distances in the resulting graph are, up to a factor of three, at least as large as those obtained after the flips.\n  This result provides a simple and uniform explanation of an emerging pattern in structural graph theory and finite model theory: the $K_{t,t}$-free fragment of a tameness notion for dense graphs often coincides with a tameness notion for sparse graphs. As immediate applications, we recover the following known equivalences. In the $K_{t,t}$-free setting, the dense notions (1) bounded shrub-depth, (2) bounded clique-width, (3) bounded flip-width, (4) monadic dependence, respectively, coincide with the sparse notions (1) bounded tree-depth, (2) bounded tree-width, (3) bounded expansion, and (4) no-where dense-ness.\n  Furthermore, we reprove the result by Dreier and Toru\u0144czyk (STOC 2025) stating that $K_{t,t}$-free classes of bounded merge-width have bounded expansion. Our proof provides explicit bounds and is direct, as it shows how to construct strong coloring orders (witnesses of bounded expansion) from merge sequences (witnesses of bounded merge-width).\n  Along the way, we identify a new family of graph parameters, dubbed separation-width, that is sandwiched between the strong and weak coloring numbers, and is closely related to the merge-width parameters. We provide evidence that this family of graph parameters, apparently overlooked in the literature, may play a fundamental role in the study of sparse graphs.",

This paper proposes a novel approach, termed the Neural Evolutionary Kernel Method (NEKM), for solving a class of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) via deep neural network (DNN)-based kernel representations. By integrating boundary integral techniques with operator learning, prior mathematical information of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is embedded into the design of neural network architectures for predicting their solutions, enhancing both computational efficiency and solution accuracy. Numerical experiments on the heat, wave, and Schr\u00f6dinger equations demonstrate that the Neural Evolutionary Kernel Method (NEKM) achieves high accuracy and favorable computational efficiency. Furthermore, the operator learning framework inherently supports the simultaneous prediction of solutions to multiple PDEs with different coefficients, rendering its capability for solving random PDEs.",

We further classify, up to (global) diffeomorphism, these contact forms in terms of the periods of their closed Reeb orbits. We conclude by relating these periods to spectral invariants of the sub-Laplacian, confirming a conjecture of Y. Colin de Verdi\u00e8re in the irregular K-contact case.",

    "title": "Improved Regret Guarantees for Online Mirror Descent using a Portfolio of Mirror Maps",
    "abstract": "OMD and its variants give a flexible framework for OCO where the performance depends crucially on the choice of the mirror map. While the geometries underlying OPGD and OEG, both special cases of OMD, are well understood, it remains a challenging open question on how to construct an optimal mirror map for any given constrained set and a general family of loss functions, e.g., sparse losses. Motivated by parameterizing a near-optimal set of mirror maps, we consider a simpler question: is it even possible to obtain polynomial gains in regret by using mirror maps for geometries that interpolate between $L_1$ and $L_2$, which may not be possible by restricting to only OEG ($L_1$) or OPGD ($L_2$).\n  Our main result answers this question positively. We show that mirror maps based on block norms adapt better to the sparsity of loss functions, compared to previous $L_p$ (for $p \\in [1, 2]$) interpolations. In particular, we construct a family of online convex optimization instances in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where block norm-based mirror maps achieve a provable polynomial (in $d$) improvement in regret over OEG and OPGD for sparse loss functions. We then turn to the setting in which the sparsity level of the loss functions is unknown. In this case, the choice of geometry itself becomes an online decision problem. We first show that naively switching between OEG and OPGD can incur linear regret, highlighting the intrinsic difficulty of geometry selection. To overcome this issue, we propose a meta-algorithm based on multiplicative weights that dynamically selects among a family of uniform block norms. We show that this approach effectively tunes OMD to the sparsity of the losses, yielding adaptive regret guarantees. Overall, our results demonstrate that online mirror-map selection can significantly enhance the ability of OMD to exploit sparsity in online convex optimization.",

    "abstract": "Fast matrix multiplication algorithms are asymptotically faster than the classical cubic-time algorithm, but they are often slower in practice. One important obstacle is the use of complex coefficients, which increases arithmetic overhead and limits practical efficiency. This paper focuses on transforming complex-coefficient matrix multiplication schemes into equivalent real- or rational-coefficient ones. We present a systematic method that, given a complex-coefficient scheme, either constructs a family of equivalent rational algorithms or proves that no equivalent rational scheme exists. Our approach relies only on basic linear-algebraic properties of similarity transformations of complex matrices. This method recovers the previously known ad hoc results of Dumas, Pernet, and Sedoglavic (2025) and extends them to more general settings, including algorithms involving rational coefficients and square roots, with $i=\\sqrt{-1}$ as a special case.\n  Using this framework, we show that no rational scheme is equivalent to Smirnov's $\\langle4,4,9,104\\rangle$ $\\mathbb{Q}[\\sqrt{161}]$ algorithm (2022) and that no real scheme is equivalent to the $\\langle4,4,4,48\\rangle$ complex algorithm of Kaporin (2024).

We propose a hierarchical block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner implemented through the Teko package in Trilinos, which effectively addresses the challenges posed by tightly coupled physics, including charge transport, porous flow, and species diffusion. The preconditioner leverages scalable subblock solvers, including smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (SA-AMG) methods and domain-decomposition techniques, to achieve robust convergence and parallel scalability. Strong and weak scaling studies demonstrate the solver's ability to handle problem sizes up to 51.3 million degrees of freedom on 2048 processors, achieving near sub-second setup and solve times for the end-to-end electrochemical solve. These advancements significantly improve the computational efficiency and turnaround time of thermal battery simulations, paving the way for higher-resolution models and enabling the transition from 2D axisymmetric to full 3D simulations.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a comprehensive framework for capturing bifurcating phenomena and detecting bifurcation curves in nonlinear multiparametric partial differential equations, where the system exhibits multiple coexisting solutions for given values of the parameters. Traditional continuation methods for one-dimensional parameterizations employ the previously computed solution as the initial guess for the next parameter value. These are usually very inefficient, since small step sizes increase computational cost, while larger steps could jeopardize the method convergence jumping to a different solution branch or missing the bifurcation point. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines: (i) arclength continuation, adaptively selecting new parameter values in higher dimension, and (ii) the deflation technique, discovering multiple branches to construct complete bifurcation diagrams. In particular, the arclength continuation method is designed to handle multiparametric scenarios, where the parameter vector $\u03bb\\in \\mathbb{R}^p$ traces a curve $g(\u03bb)$ within a $p$-dimensional parameter space. In addition, we introduce a zigzag path-following strategy to robustly track the bifurcation curves and surfaces, respectively, for two- and three-dimensional parametric spaces. Finally, we demonstrate its performance on two benchmark problems: the Bratu equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.",

Computing exact annihilation probabilities has been difficult because collisions reduce the particle count, while determinantal methods require a fixed count throughout. The ghost particle method, introduced in a companion paper for coalescence, keeps destroyed particles walking as invisible ghosts that restore the missing dimension. We apply this method to annihilation: when two particles annihilate, both trajectories continue as invisible walkers, yielding an exact determinantal formula that specifies the number of annihilations, where survivors end up, and where ghosts end up. For complete annihilation (no survivors), the formula simplifies to a Pfaffian-an algebraic relative of the determinant built from pairwise quantities-connecting to Pfaffian point process theory. The annihilation formula also yields results about coalescence: pairwise coalescence can be reinterpreted as complete annihilation, producing a Pfaffian coalescence formula. These formulas are exact for any finite initial configuration and apply to discrete lattice paths, birth-death chains, and continuous diffusions including Brownian motion.",

We then extend the analysis to a reaction model in which the switching (or killing) rate also depends on the field.

Moreover, we demonstrate how solutions without the symmetry condition can also generate such bialgebras. This motivates the introduction of quasi-triangular and factorizable noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebras.In particular, we show that a solution of the NPP-YBE with an invariant skew-symmetric part yields a quasi-triangular noncommutative pre-Poisson bialgebra.Such solutions are further interpreted as relative Rota-Baxter operators with weights.

On the regular locus B_reg = B \\ D we assume an exponentially accurate semi-flat product approximation together with a uniform vertical spectral gap at the collapse scale. Using normalized lift and fiber-average maps, we show that for each fixed time tau > 0 the fiber-compressed heat operators converge strongly on L^2 to the heat semigroup of the base Laplacian. Equivalently, bilinear pairings of the total-space heat kernel against fiber-constant lifts of test functions converge on any precompact subset of B_reg.\n  The main additional issue occurs at the discriminant: although X_t is smooth, the limiting base geometry becomes conic near D, so test functions meeting D cannot be treated by purely interior arguments. In wedge charts around D we introduce a canonical conic-renormalized bilinear functional obtained by patching the base heat-kernel pairing away from D with the model heat kernel of the corresponding flat cone. A conic parametrix shows that this functional is well-defined and independent of auxiliary cutoffs, and that the total-space bilinear pairings converge to it for arbitrary smooth compactly supported test functions and every fixed tau > 0. When the supports avoid D, the renormalization is trivial and the limit reduces to the usual base heat-kernel pairing. Under exponentially small geometric errors we obtain an explicit exponential convergence rate, uniform for tau in compact subintervals of (0, infinity). The results extend to Neumann and nonnegatively weighted Robin boundary conditions and globalize by exhaustion of the regular locus.",

Comput. Sci., 2025). Secondly, we deepen the understanding of the role of the burning process in the context of graph spectral characterizations, whose goal is to understand which graph properties are encoded in the spectrum. While for several graph properties, including the zero forcing number, it is known that the spectrum does not encode them, this question remained open for the burning number.

To address these limitations, we introduce a novel localized version of the fundamental mean-square convergence theorem for SDEs with locally Lipschitz coefficients, which naturally arise in a wide range of applications. Specifically, we show that if a numerical scheme is locally consistent in the mean-square sense of order $q>1$, then it is locally mean-square convergent with rate $q-1$. Building on this result, we further prove that global mean-square convergence follows, provided that both the exact solution and its numerical approximation admit bounded $2p$th moments for some $p>1$.\n  These new convergence results are illustrated on a class of locally Lipschitz SDEs of Hodgkin-Huxley type, characterized by a conditionally linear drift structure. For these systems, we construct different Lie-Trotter and Strang splitting methods exploiting their conditional linearity. The proposed convergence framework is then applied to these schemes, requiring innovative proofs of local consistency and boundedness of moments. In addition, we establish key structure-preserving properties of the splitting methods, in particular state-space preservation and geometric ergodicity. Numerical experiments support the theoretical results and demonstrate that the proposed splitting schemes significantly outperform Euler-Maruyama type methods in preserving the qualitative features of the model.",

    "abstract": "While filtered back projection (FBP) is still the method of choice for fast tomographic reconstruction, its performance degrades noticeably in the presence of noise, incomplete sampling, or non-standard scan geometries. We propose a data-driven approach for learning FBP filters and projection weights directly from training data, with the goal of improving robustness without sacrificing computational efficiency. The resulting reconstructions adapt naturally to the noise level and acquisition geometry, while retaining the speed and simplicity of classical back-projection. The proposed method can be formulated as a regularized optimization problem for a linear inverse operator, which allows us to establish existence, uniqueness, and stability of the learned solution. From a spectral viewpoint, the learned filters act as data-adaptive gain functions that explicitly balance noise amplification and bias, in close analogy to a regularized pseudo-inverse. Experiments in both 2D and 3D show consistent improvements over conventional FBP and FDK in different case studies. Finally, we show that filters trained on synthetic laminography data generalize well to real-world measurements, delivering image quality comparable to advanced iterative methods without the high computational cost.",

    "title": "Multi-type random game dynamics: limits at discontinuities and cyclic limits",
    "abstract": "We consider (random) strategic interactions in a large population consisting of a variety of players. A rational player chooses actions that maximize certain utility functions, while a behavioral player chooses actions based on preferences such as avoid-the-crowd or follow-the-majority. We specifically study a turn-by-turn dynamic process in which players choose their actions sequentially and once; the utilities are realized either immediately or at the end of the game.\n  In the literature, such dynamical systems are often analyzed using an appropriate approximating ordinary differential equation (ODE). However, the ODEs approximating the dynamics with pure actions are typically discontinuous. We adopt a differential inclusion (DI) based stochastic-approximation framework to derive the limiting analysis. The limits of the dynamics are characterized through the internally chain transitive (ICT) sets. We identify the presence of non-classical zeros as potential limits of the dynamics, a phenomenon not observed in classical settings involving continuous ODEs. These new limits arise precisely at the points of discontinuity of the dynamics. We further provide the conditions under which cyclic outcomes may occur at the limit.\n  Finally, we study a queuing game with differential priority-based services and examine the impact of the proportions of avoid-the-crowd and two types of rational populations on the long-run outcomes of the strategic interactions. We identify potential point limits and establish the possibility of cyclic outcomes for certain parameter configurations.",

    "abstract": "Splines are central objects for the interpolation of discrete data via piecewise smooth paths. Their iterated-integral signature is an infinite collection of tensors which characterizes paths almost uniquely. We study truncations of this collection, which define algebraic maps from parameter space to tensor space. We prove that the images of these maps are given by orbits of a matrix-tensor action. Furthermore, taking the Zariski closure, we define and study varieties of spline signature tensors. We determine dimension and degree of these tensor varieties in a number of examples, relying on symbolic computations. With a view towards learning, constructing paths with a given signature tensor translates to studying the fibers of the signature map. We use computational methods to determine their cardinality, with a focus on its dependence on different classes of splines. We observe in explicit examples that reconstructing splines from a given signature tensor of a path yields close approximations of the original path.",

    "title": "Optimizing Initial Feature-Mapping Variables from Given Designs via Tracking",
    "abstract": "A feature-mapping framework for inverse reconstruction of density-based topology optimization results is proposed. Unlike SIMP, whose voxelized outputs are hard to interpret or reuse, the method represents designs with high-level geometric primitives mapped to a fixed analysis grid. Capsule-shaped bars (endpoints plus radius) are used, with closed-form signed distances and smooth transition functions providing derivatives up to second order. Differentiable pseudo-densities are aggregated with smooth operators, enabling gradient-based optimization with exact Hessians. Robustness is improved through asymmetric transition functions that propagate sensitivities into void regions, a reward-only objective for initialization, and geometric safeguards against degenerate configurations. Reconstruction is performed in stages (exploration, bridging, convergence) with optional refinement that can add, remove, or merge features based on residuals and geometric criteria. Experiments on canonical SIMP benchmarks, including five-bar and cantilever layouts, show high-fidelity reconstructions using a moderate number of features. p-norm and softmax aggregation yield sharp results; pruning removes redundant features and additive refinement restores coverage. Exact Hessians accelerate convergence and improve robustness compared to quasi-Newton updates, providing a bridge from voxel-based outputs to explicit parametric models.",

In this paper, we extend this definition to a class of vector-valued random elements, which we characterise as fixed points of a specific affine transformation involving a random matrix obtained from the matrix exponential of a uniformly distributed random variable. We prove that these new distributions possess the key properties of infinite divisibility and operator selfdecomposability.

    "abstract": "We consider parametric linear programming problems with multiple objective functions depending linearly on some parameter. Both parametric (single-objective) linear programming and (non-parametric) multi-objective linear programming are well-researched topics. However, literature on the combination of both, parametric linear programming with multiple objectives, is scarce. This research gap encourages our work in this field. Our main focus is on biobjective linear programs with a single parameter. We establish a connection of this problem to non-parametric multi-objective problems. Using the so-called weight set decomposition, we are able to explain the behavior of parametric biobjective linear programs when the parameter value is variated. We investigate two special cases of parametric biobjective linear programs: In the first, there is only one parametric objective and, in the second, the parametric dependency is the same for both objectives. We prove that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the solution of the parametric program and the solution of the triobjective program using the weighted sum scalarization. We provide structural insights to the solution of the parametric biobjective linear program with respect to extreme weights of the weight set of the triobjective linear program and develop solution strategies for the parametric program.",

    "abstract": "We propose two easy-to-implement fast algorithms based on moment-matching to compute the nonlocal potential $\\varphi(\\textbf{x})=(U\\ast \u03c1)(\\textbf{x})$ on bounded domain, where the kernel $U$ is singular at the origin and the density $\u03c1$ is a fast-decaying smooth function. Each method requires merely minor modifications to commonly-used existing methods, i.e., the sine spectral/Fourier quadrature method, and achieves a much better convergence rate. The key lies in the introduction of a smooth auxiliary function $\u03c1_1$ whose moments match those of the density up to an integer order $m$. Specifically, $\u03c1_1$ is constructed using Gaussian function in an explicit way and the associated potential can be calculated analytically. The moments of residual density vanish up to order $m$, and the corresponding residual potential $U \\ast (\u03c1-\u03c1_1)$ decays much faster than the original potential $\\varphi$ at the far field. As for the residual potential evaluation, for classical kernels (e.g., the Coulomb kernel), we solve a differential/pseudo-differential equation on a rectangular domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions via sine pseudospectral method, and achieve an arbitrary high convergence rate. While, for general kernels, the regularity of Fourier integrand increase by $m$ thanks to the moments-vanishing property, therefore, the standard trapezoidal rule/midpoint quadrature also converges much faster. To gain a better numerical performance, we utilize the domain expansion technique to obtain better accuracy, and improve the efficiency by simplifying the quadrature into one discrete convolution and applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a double-sized vector. Rigorous error estimates and extensive numerical investigations showcase the accuracy and efficiency for different nonlocal potentials.",
