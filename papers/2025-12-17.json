We use nonabelian Hodge theory and properties of Saito's mixed Hodge modules to show that the Leray-Serre spectral sequence for the projection to M_g degenerates at E_2. As an application, we prove that the rational cohomology of these varieties stabilizes as g goes to infinity and compute the stable limit. We also deduce similar results for the universal G-character variety over M_{g,1} whose fiber over a punctured curve is the variety of G-local systems with fixed central monodromy around the puncture, for G = GL_n or SL_n.",

    "abstract": "We refine upper bounds on the permanent saturation time of metric graphs using interval exchange transformations (IETs). Earlier results gave bounds under incommensurable edge lengths, we improve and generalize them by using the ergodic and minimal properties of IETs. By associating an IET to a metric graph, we show that the induced interval dynamics are ergodic and minimal, which ensures uniform coverage over time. Our main theorem gives a sharper upper bound for the saturation time in terms of edge lengths and structural constants of the graph. We also define the Lyapunov spectrum of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle for these maps and relate it to the system's dynamics. We validate our theoretical findings through simulations on specific graph configurations, such as the complete graph $K_4$ and star graphs, confirming the accuracy of our estimates. These results strengthen existing estimates and provide tools for studying connectivity at the interface of graph theory and dynamical systems.",

Two main results illustrate the analytic and geometric scope of the theory: a Lojasiewicz gradient inequality for perplex-analytic functions, providing quantitative control of critical behavior; and a Milnor-Le type fibration theorem for nondegenerate algebras, describing the local topology of singularities. The framework reveals a continuous transition between complex and hyperbolic geometries, with the dual boundary exhibiting new infinitesimal phenomena linked to zero divisors.

    "abstract": "Solving difficult mixed-integer nonlinear programs via spatial branch-and-bound requires effective convex outer-approximations of nonconvex sets. In this framework, complex problem formulations are decomposed into simpler library functions, whose relaxations are then composed to build relaxations of the overall problem. The trilinear monomial serves as one such fundamental library function, appearing frequently as a building block across diverse applications. By definition, its convex hull provides the tightest possible relaxation and thus serves as a benchmark for evaluating alternatives. Mixed volume techniques have yielded a parameterized volume formula for the convex hull of the graph of a trilinear monomial; however, existing results only address the case where all six bounds of the box domain are nonnegative. This restriction represents a notable gap in the literature, as variables with mixed-sign domains arise naturally in practice. In this work, we close the gap by extending to the general case via an exhaustive case analysis. We demonstrate that removing the nonnegative domain assumption alters the underlying structure of the convex hull polytope, leading to six distinct volume formulae that together characterize all possible parameter configurations.",

Reduced Order Models (ROMs) provide an efficient means of approximating the Full Order Model (FOM) solution. We propose a novel approach for constructing ROMs of the Sn radiation transport equation, Offline Maximizing Minimally Invasive (OMMI) Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD). POD uses snapshot data to build a reduced basis, which is then used to project the FOM. Minimally Invasive POD leverages the sweep infrastructure within deterministic Sn transport solvers to construct the reduced linear system, even though the FOM linear system is never directly assembled. OMMI-POD extends Minimally Invasive POD by performing transport sweeps offline, thereby maximizing the potential speedup. It achieves this by generating a library of reduced systems from a training set, which is then interpolated in the online stage to provide a rapid approximate solution to the Sn transport equation. The model's performance is evaluated on a multigroup 2-D test problem, demonstrating low error and a 1600-fold speedup over the full order model.",

    "abstract": "We consider four prototypes of variational problems and prove the existence of fractal minimizers through the direct method in the calculus of variations. By design these minimizers are H\u00f6lder curves or H\u00f6lder parametrizations of hypersurfaces whose images generally have a non-integer Hausdorff dimension. Although their origin is deterministic, their regularity properties are roughly similar to those of typical realizations of stochastic processes. As a key tool, we prove novel continuity and boundedness results for potentials of occupation measures of Gaussian random fields. These results complement well-known results for local times, but hold under much less restrictive assumptions. In an auxiliary section, we generalize earlier results on non-linear compositions of fractional Sobolev functions with $BV$-functions to higher dimensions.",

Our approach integrates online and offline stochastic minimax algorithms with various decentralized learning strategies, yielding a versatile framework with broader flexibility than existing methods. Our unification is threefold: (i) we propose a unified decentralized learning strategy for minimax optimization that subsumes existing bias-correction techniques, such as gradient tracking, while introducing new variants that achieve tighter network-dependent bounds; (ii) we introduce a probabilistic gradient estimator, GRACE (Gradient Acceleration Estimator), which unifies momentum-based methods and loopless variance-reduction techniques for constructing accelerated gradients within DAMA, and is broadly applicable to general stochastic optimization problems; and (iii) we develop a unified analytical framework that establishes a general performance bound for DAMA, achieving state-of-the-art results with the best-known sample complexity. To the best of our knowledge, DAMA is the first framework to achieve a multi-level unification of decentralized learning strategies and accelerated gradient techniques. This work focuses on algorithm development and the main results, while Part II provides the theoretical analysis that substantiates these results and presents empirical validation across diverse network topologies using synthetic and real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a Variational Multiscale Stabilization (VMS) formulation of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations that utilizes the Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC) framework. The FEEC framework preserves the geometric and topological structure of continuous spaces and PDEs in the discrete spaces and model, and helps build stable and convergent discretizations. For the Navier-Stokes equations, this structure is encoded in the de Rham complex. In this work, we consider the vorticity-velocity-pressure formulation discretized within the FEEC framework. We model the effect of the unresolved scales on the finite-dimensional solution by introducing appropriate fine-scale governing equations, which we also discretize using the FEEC approach. This preserves the structure of the continuous problem in both the coarse- and fine-scale solutions; for instance, both the coarse- and fine-scale velocities are pointwise incompressible. We demonstrate that the resulting formulation is residual-based, energetically stable, and optimally convergent. Moreover, our fine-scale model provides an efficient computational approach: by decoupling fine-scale problems across elements, they can be solved in parallel. In fact, the fine-scale equations can be eliminated during matrix assembly, leading to a VMS formulation in which the problem size is governed solely by the coarse-scale discretization. Finally, the proposed formulation applies to both the lowest regularity discretizations of the de Rham complex and high-regularity isogeometric discretizations. We validate our theoretical results through numerical experiments, simulating both steady-, unsteady-, viscous-, and inviscid-flow problems. These tests show that the stabilized solutions are qualitatively better than the unstabilized ones, converge at optimal rates, and, as the mesh is refined, the stabilization is asymptotically turned off.",

We also investigate a single-cluster scenario. All the derived expressions are validated through extensive particle-based simulations. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key parameters, such as the mean number of NMs per cluster, the density of the cluster, and the spatial spread, on the detection performance. Our results show that detection probability is greatly influenced by clustering, and different spatial arrangements produce varying performances.

Thus, once that profile and a scalar normalization are fixed, all admissible scalar values are determined by the underlying spectra, yielding a rigidity principle for evaluators in this setting. The second main result is a spectral growth taxonomy: we classify self-adjoint operators by counting-function asymptotics and show that the polynomial growth class is stable under the basic constructions of the calculus.

When Hill coefficients are non-integer values--ubiquitous in experimental fitting--these functions lose differentiability at low expression, creating singularities that compromise numerical stability and impede control applications. We present a systematic framework replacing Hill functions with logistic functions: increasing for activation, decreasing for repression. Logistic functions preserve sigmoidal characteristics while offering key advantages: infinite differentiability, closed-form derivatives simplifying Jacobians, invertible forms enabling feedback linearization, and built-in basal expression. We prove existence and uniqueness with explicit Lipschitz bounds, guaranteeing unique solutions and boundedness. Parameter estimation with biologically motivated thresholds demonstrated in case studies: genetic oscillators, positive autoregulation in E. coli, two-gene chaotic networks. Simulations with experimental parameters show: logistic models allow noise escape from low-expression traps via basal, while Hill models trap irreversibly--relevant to gal operon and bistables. Logistic functions respond to absolute concentrations rather than logarithmic fold changes, aligning with molecule count-based decisions. Control advantages: controllability at zero (missing in Hill), seamless MPC integration, superior stability. Logit extensions enable network inference from scRNA-seq data, using concavity for convergence and handling dropouts. Applications: immunology, hematopoiesis with delays, environmental systems.

After conformal rescaling, it becomes a flow of coclosed $G_2$-structures, related to Grigorian's modified $G_2$ coflow, which is coupled to a flow for a dilaton function. Our main results establish fundamental short-time existence and Shi-type smoothing properties of this flow, as well as a classification of its fixed points. By a classical rigidity result in the string theory literature, the fixed points on a compact manifold correspond to torsion-free $G_2$-structures, that is, to metrics with holonomy contained in $G_2$. Thus, we establish in the affirmative a folklore question in the special holonomy community, about the existence of a well-posed flow for coclosed $G_2$-structures with fixed points given by torsion-free $G_2$-structures. The flow also satisfies a monotonicity formula for the $G_2$-dilaton functional (volume scale in string theory), which allows us to strengthen the rigidity result with an alternative proof. The monotonicity of the $G_2$-dilaton functional, combined with the Shi-type estimates, leads to a general result on the convergence of nonsingular solutions.

We give an explicit example of an incidence theorem involving 13 points that is not an absolute incidence theorem, and therefore is not an instance of the master theorem.",

Motivated by the success of parallel preconditioners in the context of Krylov methods for large scale linear systems, we introduce a novel nonlinearly preconditioned Trust-Region method that makes use of an additive Schwarz correction at each minimization step, thereby accelerating convergence.\n  More precisely, we propose a variant of the Additively Preconditioned Trust-Region Strategy (APTS), which combines a right-preconditioned additive Schwarz framework with a classical Trust-Region algorithm. By decomposing the parameter space into sub-domains, APTS solves local non-linear sub-problems in parallel and assembles their corrections additively. The resulting method not only shows fast convergence; due to the underlying Trust-Region strategy, it furthermore largely obviates the need for hyperparameter tuning.",

    "abstract": "Erdos, Herzog and Piranian asked whether, for $n$ points in the plane with fixed diameter (maximum distance between points), an arrangement of a regular $n$-gon maximizes their product of all pairs of distances. Recently, it was discovered that, for every even $n \\geq 4$, a regular $n$-gon is not a maximizer. However, the discovered improvement turns out to be very small. Indeed, for a fixed diameter of $2$, let $\u0394$ be the square of the product of all pairs of distances (the \"square\" is here due to connections with polynomial discriminants). Then, for a regular $n$-gon, $\u0394= n^n$ for even $n$. The discovered arrangements have proven $\u0394= (1+o(1))n^n$ thus far, and it was not known whether one can have $\u0394\\geq C n^n$ for some $C > 1$ and all sufficiently large even $n$. In this note, we show that indeed $\\liminf_{n\\to\\infty} \u0394_{\\max}/n^n > 1.037$ for even $n$ which settles this conjecture. Other arrangements with higher conjectured $\u0394/n^n$ values are in fact known, but we have not been able to obtain proofs that they have large products of distances. Finally, no arrangements such that $\u0394/n^n \\to \\infty$ are known and we do not know whether they exist.",

    "abstract": "We develop mathematical models for shape design and topology optimization in structural contact problems involving friction between elastic and rigid bodies. The governing mechanical constraint is a nonlinear, non-smooth, and non-convex hemivariational inequality, which provides a more general and realistic description of frictional contact forces than standard variational inequalities, but is also more challenging due to its non-convexity. For energy-type shape functionals, the Eulerian derivative of the hemivariational inequality is derived through rigorous shape sensitivity analysis. The rationality of a regularization approach is justified by asymptotic analysis, and this method is further applied to handle the non-smoothness of general shape functionals in the sensitivity framework. Based on these theoretical results, a numerical boundary variational method is proposed for shape optimization. For topology optimization, three phase-field algorithms are developed: a gradient-flow phase-field method, a phase-field method with second-order regularization of the cost functional, and a phase-field method coupled with topological derivatives. To the best of our knowledge, these approaches are new for shape design in hemivariational inequalities. Various numerical experiments confirm the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed shape and topology optimization algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The notion of resistance distance, introduced by Klein and Randi\u0107, has become a fundamental concept in spectral graph theory and network analysis, as it captures both the structural and electrical properties of a graph. The associated resistance spectrum serves as a graph invariant and plays an important role in problems related to graph isomorphism. For an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, the resistance distance $R_G(u,v)$ between two distinct vertices $u$ and $v$ is defined as the effective resistance between them when each edge of $G$ is replaced by a $1\\,\u03a9$ resistor. The multiset of all resistance distances over unordered pairs of distinct vertices is called the \\emph{resistance spectrum} of $G$, denoted by $\\operatorname{RS}(G)$. A graph $G$ is said to be \\emph{determined by its resistance spectrum} if, for any graph $H$, the equality $\\operatorname{RS}(H)=\\operatorname{RS}(G)$ implies that $H$ is isomorphic to $G$. Complete bipartite graphs, denoted by $K_{m,n}$, are highly symmetric and constitute an important class of graphs in graph theory. In this paper, by exploiting properties of resistance distances, we prove that the complete bipartite graphs $K_{n,n}$, $K_{n,n+1}$, $K_{2,n}$, and $K_{m,n}$ with $m>3n+1$ are uniquely determined by their resistance spectra.",

The proposed formulation has three unknowns, one more than the number of unknowns for the ordinary formulation. However, we can construct efficient numerical solvers based on LU factorization by exploiting the sparse alignment of the boundary integral operators of the proposed formulation. Numerical examples demonstrate that the direct solver based on the proposed formulation is approximately 40% faster than the ordinary formulation when the LU-factorization-based solver is used. In addition, the proposed formulation is applied to a fast direct solver employing LU factorization in its algorithm. In the application to the fast direct solver, the proxy method with a weak admissibility low-rank approximation is developed. The speedup achieved using the proposed formulation is also shown to be effective in finding nonlinear eigenvalues, which are related to the uniqueness of the solution, in boundary value problems. Furthermore, the well-posedness of the proposed boundary integral equation is established for scatterers with boundaries of class $C^2$, using the mapping property of boundary integral operators in H\u00f6lder space.",

    "abstract": "Robust beamforming design under imperfect channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental challenge in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, particularly when the channel estimation error statistics are unknown. Conventional model-driven methods usually rely on prior knowledge of the error covariance matrix and data-driven deep learning approaches suffer from poor generalization capability to unseen channel conditions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid offline-online framework that achieves effective offline learning and rapid online adaptation. In the offline phase, we propose a shared (among users) deep neural network (DNN) that is able to learn the channel estimation error covariance from observed samples, thus enabling robust beamforming without statistical priors. Meanwhile, to facilitate real-time deployment, we propose a sparse augmented low-rank (SALR) method to reduce complexity while maintaining comparable performance. In the online phase, we show that the proposed network can be rapidly fine-tuned with minimal gradient steps. Furthermore, a multiple basis model-agnostic meta-learning (MB-MAML) strategy is further proposed to maintain multiple meta-initializations and by dynamically selecting the best one online, we can improve the adaptation and generalization capability of the proposed framework under unseen or non-stationary channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed offline-online framework exhibits strong robustness across diverse channel conditions and it is able to significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines.",

By modelling the three orthogonal dipole components at each location as a single coherent group, we demonstrate that depth bias and orientation bias can be effectively mitigated through the proposed regularization framework. On the theoretical front, we provide concise recovery guarantees for both single and multiple group sources. Our numerical experiments highlight that while theoretical bounds hold for a broad range of weight definitions, the practical reconstruction quality, for cases not covered by the theory, depends significantly on the specific weighting strategy employed. Specifically, employing a truncated Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse for the involved weighting matrix gives a small Dipole Localization Error (DLE). The proposed method offers a robust approach for inverse EEG problems, enabling improved spatial accuracy and a more physiologically realistic reconstruction of neural activity.",

    "title": "The Cost of Adaptation under Differential Privacy: Optimal Adaptive Federated Density Estimation",
    "abstract": "Privacy-preserving data analysis has become a central challenge in modern statistics. At the same time, a long-standing goal in statistics is the development of adaptive procedures -- methods that achieve near-optimal performance across diverse function classes without prior knowledge of underlying smoothness or complexity. While adaptation is often achievable at no extra cost in the classical non-private setting, this naturally raises a fundamental question: to what extent is adaptation still possible under privacy constraints?\n  We address this question in the context of density estimation under federated differential privacy (FDP), a framework that encompasses both central and local DP models. We establish sharp results that characterize the cost of adaptation under FDP for both global and pointwise estimation, revealing fundamental differences from the non-private case. We then propose an adaptive FDP estimator that achieves explicit performance guarantees by introducing a new noise mechanism, enabling one-shot adaptation via post-processing. This approach strictly improves upon existing adaptive DP methods. Finally, we develop new lower bound techniques that capture the limits of adaptive inference under privacy and may be of independent interest beyond this problem.\n  Our findings reveal a sharp contrast between private and non-private settings. For global estimation, where adaptation can be achieved for free in the classical non-private setting, we prove that under FDP an intrinsic adaptation cost is unavoidable. For pointwise estimation, where a logarithmic penalty is already known to arise in the non-private setting, we show that FDP introduces an additional logarithmic factor, thereby compounding the cost of adaptation. Taken together, these results provide the first rigorous characterization of the adaptive privacy-accuracy trade-off.",

    "title": "Symbol Distributions in Semantic Communications: A Source-Channel Equilibrium Perspective",
    "abstract": "Semantic communication systems often use an end-to-end neural network to map input data into continuous symbols. These symbols, which are essentially neural network features, usually have fixed dimensions and heavy-tailed distributions. However, due to the end-to-end training nature of the neural network encoder, the underlying reason for the symbol distribution remains underexplored. We propose a new explanation for the semantic symbol distribution: an inherent trade-off between source coding and communications. Specifically, the encoder balances two objectives: allocating power for minimum \\emph{effective codelength} (for source coding) and maximizing mutual information (for communications). We formalize this trade-off via an information-theoretic optimization framework, which yields a Student's $t$-distribution as the resulting symbol distribution. Through extensive studies on image-based semantic systems, we find that our formulation models the learned symbols and predicts how the symbol distribution's shape parameter changes with respect to (i) the use of variable-length coding and (ii) the dataset's entropy variability. Furthermore, we demonstrate how introducing a regularizer that enforces a target symbol distribution, which guides the encoder towards a target prior (e.g., Gaussian), improves training convergence and supports our hypothesis.",

    "abstract": "The recently proposed information geometric regularization (IGR) was the first inviscid regularization of the multi-dimensional compressible Euler equations, which enabled the simulation of realistic compressible fluid models at an unprecedented scale. However, the thermodynamic effects of this regularization have not yet been understood in a principled manner. To achieve a proper understanding of the thermodynamic aspects of the IGR, we decompose the regularization into its conservative dynamics, framed as a Hamiltonian subsystem, and its dissipative dynamics. In so doing, we further introduce two more models to compare to IGR, the Hamiltonian regularized Euler (HRE) model, which is the first multi-dimensional, non-dispersive Hamiltonian regularization of the compressible Euler equations with energy, as well as the Hamiltonian IGR (HIGR) model, which modifies the dissipation used in the IGR model to instead utilize a metriplectic dissipative force. Despite having many attractive features, the HRE and HIGR models exhibit notable defects in numerical tests on colliding shock problems, which preclude their use as computational tools without further study of dissipative weak solutions to these models. Additionally, our analysis presents new results on the IGR model itself, including its ability to conserve acoustic waves, as well as local energy transport laws and entropy production rates. By separating the conservative and dissipative dynamics of the IGR, our hope is that subsequent of analysis of the IGR model can benefit from this natural decomposition, such as, for example, rigorous proofs of strong solutions for multi-dimensional IGR for the compressible Euler system with thermodynamics.",

We then explore the behavior of $q$-numerical ranges under complex symmetry, deriving inclusion relations between $W_q(T)$ and $W_q(T^*)$ for complex symmetric operators. For hyponormal operators similar to their adjoints, we provide conditions under which $T$ is self-adjoint and $W_q(T)$ is a real interval. We also study the continuity of $q$-numerical ranges under norm convergence and examine the effect of the Aluthge transform on $W_q(T)$. In the second part, we derive several new and sharp upper bounds for the $q$-numerical radius, incorporating the operator norm, numerical radius, transcendental radius, and the infimum of $\\|Tx\\|$ over the unit sphere. These bounds unify and improve upon existing results in the literature, offering a comprehensive framework for estimating $q$-numerical radii across the entire parameter range $q \\in [0,1]$.

Then we obtain several equivalent characterizations of the second-order qualification condition (SOQC) and highlight its equivalence to the constraint nondegeneracy condition under the $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility assumption. These insights lead us to multiple equivalent conditions for the major Lipschitz-like/Aubin property of KKT systems, including the SOQC combined with the new second-order subdifferential condition and the SOQC combined with tilt stability of local minimizers. Furthermore, under $\\mathcal{C}^{2}$-cone reducibility, we prove that the Lipschitz-like property of the reference KKT system is equivalent to its strong regularity. Finally, we demonstrate that the Lipschitz-like property is equivalent to the nonsingularity of the generalized Jacobian associated with the KKT system under a certain verifiable assumption. These results provide a unified and rigorous framework for analyzing stability and sensitivity of solutions to composite optimization problems, as well as for the design and justification of numerical algorithms.",

Using the wide class of variable scale mixture distributions we argue that the codifference can be interpreted as the measure of bulk properties which ignores the tails much more than the covariance.

In this work, we consider the detection of a planted matching, i.e., an independent edge set, hidden in an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi random graph, which is formulated as a hypothesis testing problem. We identify the critical regime for this testing problem and prove that the log-likelihood ratio is asymptotically normal. Via analyses of computationally efficient edge or wedge count test statistics that attain the optimal limits of detection, our results also reveal the absence of a statistical-to-computational gap. Our main technical tool is the cluster expansion from statistical physics, which allows us to prove a precise, non-asymptotic characterization of the log-likelihood ratio. Our analyses rely on a careful reorganization and cancellation of terms that occur in the difference between monomer-dimer log partition functions on the complete and Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graphs. This combinatorial and statistical physics approach represents a significant departure from the more established methods such as orthogonal decompositions, and positions the cluster expansion as a viable technique in the study of log-likelihood ratios for planted models in general.",

For a linear system with Gaussian noise, we show that there exists an optimal subspace for this decision variable $g$, which is the null space of the innovation Hankel matrix. If the decision vector lies in this null space, the resulting predictor gets closer to the Kalman predictor. To show this, we use a result that we refer to as the Kalman Filter Fundamental Lemma (KFFL), which applies Willems' lemma to the Kalman predictor. This viewpoint also explains several existing data-driven predictive control methods: regularized DeePC schemes act as soft versions of the innovation null-space constraint, instrumental-variable methods enforce it by construction, and ARX-based approaches explicitly estimate this innovation null space.",

This result enables us, for a given linear regression problem, to define a partial order on the set of spectral methods according to their convergence rates, thereby characterizing which spectral algorithm is superior for that specific problem. Furthermore, this allows us to generalize the saturation effect proposed in inverse problems and to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for its occurrence.

We first prove sharp upper bounds for $\u03b2_{p,1}(X)$ depending on the degree of a projective variety $X$, extending the classical quadratic bounds to all linear syzygies and identifying the extremal varieties in each range. We then introduce geometric conditions that describe how containment of $X$ in low-degree varieties influences syzygies, and we show that these conditions stratify the quadratic strand into a finite sequence of hierarchies. This leads to a complete description of all possible extremal behavior.

    "abstract": "Model order reduction seeks to approximate large-scale dynamical systems by lower-dimensional reduced models. For linear systems, a small reduced dimension directly translates into low computational cost, ensuring online efficiency. This property does not generally hold for nonlinear systems, where an additional approximation of nonlinear terms -- known as complexity reduction -- is required. To achieve online efficiency, empirical quadrature and cell-based empirical cubature are among the most effective complexity reduction techniques. However, existing offline training algorithms can be prohibitively expensive because they operate on raw snapshot data of all nonlinear integrands associated with the reduced model. In this paper, we introduce a preprocessing approach based on a specific structured compression of the training data. Its key feature is that it scales only with the number of collected snapshots, rather than additionally with the reduced model dimension. Overall, this yields roughly an order-of-magnitude reduction in offline computational cost and memory requirements, thereby enabling the application of the complexity reduction methods to larger-scale problems. Accuracy is preserved, as indicated by our error analysis and demonstrated through numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "We derive power counting formulas for ribbon graph amplitudes that were recently independently discovered in two contexts, namely as a generalization of the Kontsevich model, and as corresponding to a matrix model approach to the spectral action. The Feynman rules are based on divided difference functions of eigenvalues of an abstract Dirac operator. We obtain formulas for the order of divergence, depending on the spectral dimension $d$, the order of decay of the test function $f$ of the spectral action, and the graph properties. Several consequences are discussed, such as the fact that all graphs with maximal order of divergence (at a given loop order and number of external vertices) are planar. To derive our main results we establish two-sided bounds for divided differences, and in particular generalize Hunter's positivity theorem to a larger class of functions.",

Prior work on compression-based denoising has been limited to additive noise channels. We extend this framework to general discrete memoryless channels by deliberately choosing the distortion measure for the lossy compressor to match the channel conditional distribution. By bounding the deviation of the empirical joint distribution of the source, observation, and denoiser outputs from satisfying a Markov property, we give an exact characterization of the loss achieved by such a denoiser. Consequences of these results are explicitly demonstrated in special cases, including for MSE and Hamming loss. A comparison is made to an indirect rate-distortion perspective on the problem.",

Both $f$ and $h$ may be nonconvex. iR2N is particularly suited to settings where proximal operators are computed via iterative procedures that can be stopped early, or where the accuracy of $f$ and $\\nabla f$ can be controlled, leading to significant computational savings. At each iteration, the method approximately minimizes the sum of a quadratic model of $f$, a model of $h$, and an adaptive quadratic regularization term ensuring global convergence. Under standard accuracy assumptions, we prove global convergence in the sense that a first-order stationarity measure converges to zero, with worst-case evaluation complexity $O(\u03b5^{-2})$. Numerical experiments with $\\ell_p$ norms, $\\ell_p$ total variation, and the indicator of the nonconvex pseudo $p$-norm ball illustrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the approach, and show how controlled inexactness can substantially reduce computational effort.",

Unlike earlier implementations that relied on multiple parametric simulations to excite each heat source independently, the proposed approach simultaneously identifies all model coefficients using fully transient excitations. Two estimation strategies namely rank-reduction and two-stage decomposition are developed to further reduce computational cost and improve scalability for larger systems. The proposed strategies yield ROMs with mean temperature-prediction errors within 5% of CFD simulations while reducing model-development times to O(10^0 s)-O(10^1 s). Once constructed, the ROM evaluates new transient operating conditions in O(10^0 s), enabling rapid thermal analysis and enabling automated generation of digital twins for both simulated and physical systems.",

    "abstract": "The advancement to 6G calls for waveforms that transcend static robustness to achieve intelligent adaptability. Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM), despite its strength in doubly-dispersive channels, has been confined by chirp parameters optimized for worst-case scenarios. This paper shatters this limitation with Agile-AFDM, a novel framework that endows AFDM with dynamic, data-aware intelligence. By redefining chirp parameters as optimizable variables for each transmission block based on real-time channel and data information, Agile-AFDM transforms into an adaptive platform. It can actively reconfigure its waveform to minimize peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) for power efficiency, suppress inter-carrier interference (ICI) for communication reliability, or reduce Cramer-Rao bound (CRLB) for sensing accuracy. This paradigm shift from a static, one-size-fits-all waveform to a context-aware signal designer is made practical by efficient, tailored optimization algorithms. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that this capability delivers significant performance gains across all metrics, surpassing conventional OFDM and static AFDM. Agile-AFDM, therefore, offers a crucial step forward in the design of agile waveforms for 6G and beyond.",

    "title": "Enhancing Orbital Debris Remediation with Reconfigurable Space-Based Laser Constellations",
    "abstract": "Orbital debris poses an escalating threat to space missions and the long-term sustainability of Earth's orbital environment. The literature proposes various approaches for orbital debris remediation, including the use of multiple space-based lasers that collaboratively engage debris targets. While the proof of concept for this laser-based approach has been demonstrated, critical questions remain about its scalability and responsiveness as the debris population continues to expand rapidly. This paper introduces constellation reconfiguration as a system-level strategy to address these limitations. Through coordinated orbital maneuvers, laser-equipped satellites can dynamically adapt their positions to respond to evolving debris distributions and time-critical events. We formalize this concept as the Reconfigurable Laser-to-Debris Engagement Scheduling Problem (R-L2D-ESP), an optimization framework that determines the optimal sequence of constellation reconfigurations and laser engagements to maximize debris remediation capacity, which quantifies the constellation's ability to nudge, deorbit, or perform just-in-time collision avoidance maneuvers on debris objects. To manage the complexity of this combinatorial optimization problem, we employ a receding horizon approach. Our experiments reveal that reconfigurable constellations significantly outperform static ones, achieving greater debris remediation capacity and successfully deorbiting substantially more debris objects. Additionally, our sensitivity analyses identify the key parameters that influence remediation performance the most, providing essential insights for future system design. These findings demonstrate that constellation reconfiguration represents a promising advancement for laser-based debris removal systems, offering the adaptability and scalability necessary to enhance this particular approach to orbital debris remediation.",

    "title": "Learning the score under shape constraints",
    "abstract": "Score estimation has recently emerged as a key modern statistical challenge, due to its pivotal role in generative modelling via diffusion models. Moreover, it is an essential ingredient in a new approach to linear regression via convex $M$-estimation, where the corresponding error densities are projected onto the log-concave class. Motivated by these applications, we study the minimax risk of score estimation with respect to squared $L^2(P_0)$-loss, where $P_0$ denotes an underlying log-concave distribution on $\\mathbb{R}$. Such distributions have decreasing score functions, but on its own, this shape constraint is insufficient to guarantee a finite minimax risk. We therefore define subclasses of log-concave densities that capture two fundamental aspects of the estimation problem. First, we establish the crucial impact of tail behaviour on score estimation by determining the minimax rate over a class of log-concave densities whose score function exhibits controlled growth relative to the quantile levels. Second, we explore the interplay between smoothness and log-concavity by considering the class of log-concave densities with a scale restriction and a $(\u03b2,L)$-H\u00f6lder assumption on the log-density for some $\u03b2\\in [1,2]$. We show that the minimax risk over this latter class is of order $L^{2/(2\u03b2+1)}n^{-\u03b2/(2\u03b2+1)}$ up to poly-logarithmic factors, where $n$ denotes the sample size. When $\u03b2< 2$, this rate is faster than could be obtained under either the shape constraint or the smoothness assumption alone. Our upper bounds are attained by a locally adaptive, multiscale estimator constructed from a uniform confidence band for the score function. This study highlights intriguing differences between the score estimation and density estimation problems over this shape-constrained class.",

Realistic deployment of such software would require the simultaneous treatment of nonlinear and potentially non-smooth PDE dynamics, limited theoretical guarantees on the existence and regularity of control-to-state mappings under varying boundary conditions, and computational performance compatible with operational decision-making. In addition, practical settings motivate consideration of uncertainty arising from forecasts of demand, inflows, and environmental conditions. At present, the theoretical foundations, numerical optimization methods, and large-scale scientific computing tools required to address these challenges in a unified and tractable manner remain the subject of ongoing research across the associated research communities. Rather than proposing a complete solution, this work uses the problem as a case study to identify and organize the mathematical, algorithmic, and computational components that would be necessary for its realization. The resulting framework highlights open challenges and intermediate research directions, and may inform both more circumscribed related problems and the design of future large-scale collaborative efforts aimed at addressing such objectives.",

    "title": "Dimension growth and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of representations of quantum groups",
    "abstract": "We consider two algebraic invariants in the representation theory of quantized enveloping algebras: the dimension growth of simple modules for the De Concini-Kac quantum group at roots of unity, and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension of simple highest weight modules for the quantum group at generic $q$. In spite of being defined for different values of the parameter $q$, these invariants reflect closely related features in the respective contexts. We show that several new phenomena appear in the quantum case and the representations with non-integral weights contribute to both invariants in a way that cannot be ignored. Building on this, we determine the minimal non-zero value of these invariants for each Lie type. As an application we show that quantum cuspidal modules at generic $q$ can occur only when the underlying semisimple Lie algebra has simple components of type $A$, $B$, or $C$, providing a more explicit representation-theoretic distinction with the classical case.",

The intersection number is minimal for powers of a single $\u03c8$-class (i.e. all $e_i$ but one vanish), whereas maximal values are obtained for balanced vectors ($|e_i - e_j| \\leq 1$ for all $i,j$). The proof uses the nefness of the $\u03c8$-classes combined with Khovanskii--Teissier log-concavity.\n  Apart from the mathematical content, this paper is also meant as an experiment in collaborations between human mathematicians and AI models: the proof of the above result was found and formulated by the AI models GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro. Large parts of the paper were drafted by Claude Opus 4.5, and a part of the argument was formalized in Lean with the help of Claude Code and GPT-5.2.

Under the assumption that the Rees algebra of one filtration is Noetherian and that a natural graded module measuring the interaction between the filtrations is finitely generated over it, we show that the corresponding defect function is asymptotically a quasi-polynomial. Moreover, the defect function becomes eventually polynomial when the Rees algebra of the first filtration is standard graded. For filtrations arising from saturations and ordinary powers of monomial ideals, we further analyze the structure of the quasi-polynomial. We prove that the top two coefficients of the eventual quasi-polynomial are constant under natural hypotheses.",

We show that if the exterior of a Brunnian $\u03b8$-curve is atoroidal, then it does not contain an essential annulus. Previously, Ozawa-Tsutsumi showed that there is no essential disc. Consequently, by Thurston's work, the exterior of an atoroidal Brunnian $\u03b8$-curve is hyperbolic with totally geodesic boundary. It follows that Brunnian $\u03b8$-curves of low bridge number have exteriors that are hyperbolic with totally geodesic boundary. We also show that two Brunnian $\u03b8$-curves are isotopic if and only if they are neighborhood isotopic and classify Brunnian spines of genus 2 handlebody knots. We rely heavily on a classification of annuli in the exteriors of genus two handlebody knots by Koda-Ozawa and further developed by Wang in conjunction with sutured manifold theory results of Taylor.",

In this paper, we investigate this question and related issues within the framework of totally minimal systems, including a characterization of transitive systems that are disjoint from all totally minimal systems.\n  A dynamical system is scattering (resp. weakly scattering) if its product with any minimal (resp. minimal and equicontinuous) system is transitive. It turns out that $(X,T)$ is scattering if and only if for any transitive point $x\\in X$ and any minimal system $(Y,S)$ there is $y\\in Y$ such that the orbit of $(x,y)$ is dense in $X\\times Y$ if and only if for each transitive point $x\\in X$ and any non-empty open subset $U$ of $X$, $\\{n\\in \\mathbb{N}:T^nx\\in U\\}$ is an $R$-sequence.
