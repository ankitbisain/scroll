    "title": "A stabilized virtual element framework for the steady state Boussinesq equation with temperature-dependent parameters",
    "abstract": "This work presents a new conforming stabilized virtual element method for the generalized Boussinesq equation with temperature-dependent viscosity and thermal conductivity. A gradient-based local projection stabilization method is introduced in the discrete formulation to circumvent the violation of the discrete inf-sup condition. The well-posedness of the continuous problem is established under sufficiently small datum. We derive a stabilized virtual element problem for the Boussinesq equation using equal-order virtual element approximations. The proposed method has several advantages, such as being more straightforward to implement, free from higher-order derivative terms, providing separate stabilization terms without introducing coupling between solution components, and minimizing the number of globally coupled degrees of freedom. The existence of a discrete solution to the stabilized virtual element problem is demonstrated using the Brouwer fixed-point theorem. The error estimates are derived in the energy norm. Additionally, several numerical examples are presented to show the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method, confirming the theoretical results.",

This formulation is motivated by the observation that distance measurements in many analytical and applied contexts are often affected by intrinsic or external deviations that cannot be captured by the usual metric-type geometries. We also identify a meaningful specialization arising when the control function $\u03b6$ is constant, leading to the notion of a \\emph{perturbed $b$-metric space}, introduced here as a natural restriction of the general framework.\n  We establish several fundamental properties of spaces of the form $(X,\\mathcal{D}_\u03b6,\\hbar)$ and develop a Banach-type fixed point theorem in the perturbed extended $b$-metric setting. Conditions ensuring the existence and uniqueness of fixed points of a self-map $T:X\\to X$ are derived, together with convergence of Picard iterations $T^{n}v \\to \\vartheta$. Illustrative examples are provided to show that the presence of the perturbation term $\\hbar$, together with the influence of the control function $\u03b6$, may cause $\\mathcal{D}_\u03b6$ to lose the usual extended $b$-metric behaviour and prevent $\\mathcal{D}_\u03b6$ from satisfying the standard extended $b$-metric axioms.

The vertex set is given by a marked Poisson point process on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with intensity $\u03bb>0$, where each vertex carries an independent weight. Pairs of vertices are then connected independently with a probability that depends on both their spatial displacement and their respective weights. It is well known that such models undergo a phase transition in $\u03bb$ with respect to the existence of an infinite cluster (under suitable assumptions on the connection probabilities and the weight distribution). We prove that in the subcritical regime the cluster-size distribution has exponentially decaying tails, whereas in the supercritical regime the percolation probability grows at least linearly with respect to $\u03bb$ near criticality. Our proof follows the approach of Duminil-Copin, Raoufi, and Tassion, applying the OSSS inequality to a finite-lattice approximation of the continuum model in order to derive a new differential inequality, which we then analyze and pass to the limit. In addition to the classical random connection model, we consider weighted models with unbounded weights satisfying the min-reach condition under which the neighborhood of each vertex is deterministically bounded by a radius depending solely on its weight. Notably, finite range is not assumed -- that is, we allow unbounded edge lengths -- but the weight distribution is required to satisfy appropriate moment conditions. We expect that our method extends to a broad class of weighted random connection models.",

For the inverse problem, we derive a probabilistic stability estimate for determining the principle symbol of the covariance operator of the random potential. The stability result provides an estimate of the probability for an event when the principle symbol can be quantitatively determined by a single realization of the multi-frequency backscattered far-field pattern.

    "abstract": "Designs which are minimax in the presence of model misspecifications have been constructed so as to minimize the maximum, over classes of alternate response models, of the integrated mean squared error of the predicted values. This mean squared error decomposes into a term arising solely from variation, and a bias term arising from the model errors. Here we consider two associated problems: (i) design so as to minimize the variance, subject to a bound on the bias, and (ii) design so as to minimize the bias, subject to a bound on the variance. We show that solutions to both problems are given by the minimax designs, with appropriately chosen values of their tuning constant. Conversely, any minimax design solves both problems for appropriate choices of the bounds on the bias or variance.",

    "title": "Littlewood-Offord bounds on the symmetric groups and applications",
    "abstract": "The anti-concentration phenomenon in probability theory has been intensively studied in recent years, with applications across many areas of mathematics. In most existing works, the ambient probability space is a product space generated by independent random variables. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study of anti-concentration when the ambient space is the symmetric group, equipped with the uniform measure. Concretely, we focus on the random sum $S_\u03c0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i\\, v_{\u03c0(i)}$, where $w=(w_1,\\dots,w_n)$ and $v=(v_1,\\dots,v_n)$ are fixed vectors and $\u03c0$ is a uniformly random permutation.\n  The paper contains several new results, addressing both discrete and continuous anti-concentration phenomena. On the discrete side, we establish a near-optimal structural characterization of the vectors $w$ and $v$ under the assumption that the concentration probability $\\sup_x P(S_\u03c0=x)$ is polynomially large. As applications, we derive and strengthen a number of previous results. In particular, we show that if both $w$ and $v$ have distinct entries, then $\\sup_x P(S_\u03c0=x) \\le n^{-5/2+o(1)}$. This bound serves as a permutation-space analogue of the classical Erd\u0151s--Moser bound in the product-space setting and answers a question posed by Alon--Pohoata--Zhu.\n  From the continuous perspective, we study the small-ball event $|S_\u03c0-L|\\le \u03b4$. We establish sharp bounds in various settings, including results exhibiting sub-gaussian decay in $L$. With additional effort, we are also able to treat the joint distribution of these events. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the vectors $w$ and $v$ for which these small-ball probabilities are large. As an application, we prove that the number of extremal points of random permutation polynomials is bounded by $O(\\log n)$, extending results of S{\u00f6}ze on the number of real roots.",

    "abstract": "The operator-theoretic dichotomy underlying diffusion on directed networks is \\emph{symmetry versus non-self-adjointness} of the Markov transition operator. In the reversible (detailed-balance) regime, a directed random walk $P$ is self-adjoint in a stationary $\u03c0$-weighted inner product and admits orthogonal spectral coordinates; outside reversibility, $P$ is genuinely non-self-adjoint (often non-normal), and stability is governed by biorthogonal geometry and eigenvector conditioning. In this paper we develop a harmonic-analysis framework for directed graphs anchored on the random-walk transition matrix $P=D_{\\mathrm{out}}^{-1}A$ and the random-walk Laplacian $L_{\\mathrm{rw}}=I-P$. Using biorthogonal left/right eigenvectors we define a \\emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) adapted to directed diffusion, propose a diffusion-consistent frequency ordering based on decay rates $\\Re(1-\u03bb)$, and derive operator-norm stability bounds for iterated diffusion and for BGFT spectral filters. We prove sampling and reconstruction theorems for $P$-bandlimited (equivalently $L_{\\mathrm{rw}}$-bandlimited) signals and quantify noise amplification through the conditioning of the biorthogonal eigenbasis. A simulation protocol on directed cycles and perturbed non-normal digraphs demonstrates that asymmetry alone does not dictate instability; rather, non-normality and eigenvector ill-conditioning drive reconstruction sensitivity, making BGFT a natural analytical language for directed diffusion processes.",

We introduce a sequential decision-making model that consolidates several problem characteristics and can be easily extended to include additional characteristics. To solve the problem, we design an efficient procedure for enumerating all feasible vehicle-to-request assignments, and we introduce scalable techniques to deal with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. We construct reusable benchmark instances that are based on real-world data and that capture a range of spatial structures and demand distributions. Our proposed modelling framework, policies and benchmark instances allow us to analyze interactions between problem characteristics that were not previously studied. We find no significant difference between revenue generated by internal combustion engine fleets and fast-charging electric fleets, but both significantly outperform slow-charging electric fleets. We also find that pooling increases the revenue, and reduces revenue variability, for all fleet types. Our contributions can help coordinate the significant research effort that this problem continues to receive.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in large-scale position-reconfigurable antennas have opened up new dimensions to effectively utilize the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) of wireless channels. However, the deployment of existing antenna placement schemes is primarily hindered by their limited scalability and frequently overlooked near-field effects in large-scale antenna systems. In this paper, we propose a novel antenna placement approach tailored for near-field massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, which effectively exploits the spatial DoFs to enhance spectral efficiency. For that purpose, we first reformulate the antenna placement problem in the angular domain, resulting in a weighted Fekete problem. We then derive the optimality condition and reveal that the {optimal} antenna placement is in principle an electrostatic equilibrium problem. To further reduce the computational complexity of numerical optimization, we propose an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based framework to efficiently solve the equilibrium problem. In particular, the optimal antenna positions are characterized by the roots of the polynomial solutions to specific ODEs in the normalized angular domain. By simply adopting a two-step eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) approach, the optimal antenna positions can be efficiently obtained. Furthermore, we perform an asymptotic analysis when the antenna size tends to infinity, which yields a closed-form solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently harnesses the spatial DoFs of near-field channels with prominent gains in spectral efficiency and maintains robustness against system parameter mismatches. In addition, the derived asymptotic closed-form {solution} closely approaches the theoretical optimum across a wide range of practical scenarios.",

We show, that there are some restrictions on the nonzero pattern needed for a stable construction of the FSAI preconditioner in this case. With these restrictions FSAI is well-defined. Moreover, we proved that the FSAI preconditioner shares some important properties with the original system. The lower triangular matrix $L_G$ and the upper triangular matrix $U_G$, generated by FSAI, are non-singular and non-negative. The diagonal entries of $L_GAU_G$ are positive and $L_GAU_G$, the preconditioned matrix, is a singular M-matrix. Even more, we establish that a (1,2)-inverse is computed for the complete nonzero patter.",

    "abstract": "The skew mean curvature flow is an evolution equation for $d$ dimensional ma\\-nifolds embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{d+2}$ (or more generally, in a Riemannian manifold). It can be viewed as a Schr\u00f6dinger analogue of the mean curvature flow, or alternatively as a quasilinear version of the Schr\u00f6dinger Map equation. In this article, we prove large data local well-posedness in low-regularity Sobolev spaces for the skew mean curvature flow in dimension $d\\geq 2$. This is achieved by introducing several new ideas: (i) a time discretization method to establish the existence of smooth solutions, (ii) constructing the orthonormal frame by a parallel transport method and a lifting criterion, (iii) introducing intrinsic fractional function spaces $X^s\\subset H^s$ on a noncompact manifold for any $s>\\frac{d}{2}$, such that the $X^s$-norm of the second fundamental form can be propagated well along the quasilinear Schr\u00f6dinger flow, (iv) deriving a difference equation to prove the uniqueness result for solutions $F\\in C^2$, which is independent in the choices of gauge.

A key difficulty is that the standard scaling argument, which is important in the classical normalized solution approach, is no longer available in the variable exponent setup. To address this, we work with a constrained variational framework and establish the existence of a ground state solution. We further show that these solutions are $C^{1,\u03b1}_{loc}(\\mathbb{R}^N)$.

In this general setting, the optimal transport map is formally the subgradient of a convex function that is infinite almost everywhere, rendering conventional duality-based variational methods ineffective. We overcome this analytical barrier by exploiting a constructive operator-theoretic approach. Our central result proves that the Kantorovich problem for any pair of Gaussian measures reduces to a Monge problem; that is, an optimal transport map exists in at least one direction between two measures. This reduction allows for a complete characterization with explicit formulas for all optimal (potentially unbounded) Monge transport map and Kantorovich couplings, as well as establishing their uniqueness. Furthermore, we provide a full description of the convex set of geodesics between degenerate measures, revealing a rich geometric structure where the classical McCann interpolants arise as the extreme points. We apply these findings to construct transport maps for Gaussian processes and introduce a novel framework for Wasserstein barycenters based on random Green's operators.",

In this work, we show that singular fluctuation admits a precise and natural interpretation as a \\emph{specific heat}: the second derivative of the Bayesian free energy with respect to temperature. Equivalently, it measures the posterior variance of the log-likelihood observable under the tempered Gibbs posterior. We further introduce a collection of related thermodynamic quantities, including entropy flow, prior susceptibility, and cross-susceptibility, that together provide a detailed geometric diagnosis of singular posterior structure. Through extensive numerical experiments spanning discrete symmetries, boundary singularities, continuous gauge freedoms, and piecewise (ReLU) models, we demonstrate that these thermodynamic signatures cleanly distinguish singularity types, exhibit stable finite-sample behavior, and reveal phase-transition--like phenomena as temperature varies. We also show empirically that the widely used WAIC estimator \\citep{watanabe2010asymptotic, watanabe2013widely} is exactly twice the thermodynamic specific heat at unit temperature, clarifying its robustness in singular models.Our results establish a concrete bridge between singular learning theory and statistical mechanics, providing both theoretical insight and practical diagnostics for modern Bayesian models.",

    "title": "Learning to Reconfigure: Using Device Status to Select the Right Constrained Coding Scheme",
    "abstract": "In the age of data revolution, a modern storage~or transmission system typically requires different levels of protection. For example, the coding technique used to fortify data in a modern storage system when the device is fresh cannot be the same as that used when the device ages. Therefore, providing reconfigurable coding schemes and devising an effective way to perform this reconfiguration are key to extending the device lifetime. We focus on constrained coding schemes for the emerging two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) technology. Recently, we have designed efficient lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) coding schemes for various stages of the TDMR device lifetime, focusing on the elimination of isolation patterns, and demonstrated remarkable gains by using them. LOCO codes are naturally reconfigurable, and we exploit this feature in our work. Reconfiguration based on predetermined time stamps, which is what the industry adopts, neglects the actual device status. Instead, we propose offline and online learning methods to perform this task based on the device status. In offline learning, training data is assumed to be available throughout the time span of interest, while in online learning, we only use training data at specific time intervals to make consequential decisions. We fit the training data to polynomial equations that give the bit error rate in terms of TD density, then design an optimization problem in order to reach the optimal reconfiguration decisions to switch from a coding scheme to another. The objective is to maximize the storage capacity and/or minimize the decoding complexity. The problem reduces to a linear programming problem. We show that our solution is the global optimal based on problem characteristics, and we offer various experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in TDMR systems.",

This yields a direct link to rate-distortion theory and shows that Shannon entropy emerges endogenously as the honest local utility for predictive refinement. Bernardo's characterization of proper local scoring rules together with Shannon's amalgamation invariance imply that the logarithmic score, and hence mutual information, is the unique information measure consistent with coherent prediction under refinement of the state space. Information costs, therefore, need not be assumed: they arise as expected predictive utility. Within this framework we establish a supported complete-class result: the optimal policies are Gibbs-Boltzmann channels, with the classical rational-inattention family recovered as a special case. Canonical models appear as geometric specializations of the same structure, including multinomial logit (and IIA) under entropic regularization, James-Stein shrinkage as optimal capacity allocation in Gaussian learning, and linear-quadratic-Gaussian control as the capacity-optimal Gaussian channel. Overall, the Bayesian predictive formulation reframes bounded rationality as an optimal design principle: finite information capacity is an endogenous solution to a well-posed predictive problem, and behaviors often attributed to cognitive frictions, soft choice, regularization, sparsity, and screening arise as rational responses to the geometry of predictive refinement.",

    "abstract": "We study a remote estimation setup with an autoregressive (AR) Markov process, a sensor, and a remote estimator. The sensor observes the process and sends encoded observations to the estimator as packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as the Gilbert-Elliot (GE) channel. We assume that the sensor gets to observe the channel state by the ACK/NACK feedback mechanism only when it attempts a transmission while it does not observe the channel state when no transmission attempt is made. The objective is to design a transmission scheduling strategy for the sensor, and an estimation strategy for the estimator that are jointly optimal, i.e., they minimize the expected value of an infinite-horizon cumulative discounted cost defined as the sum of squared estimation error over time and the sensor's transmission power. Since the sensor and the estimator have access to different information sets, this constitutes a decentralized stochastic control problem. We formulate this problem as a partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP) and show the existence of jointly optimal transmission and estimation strategies that have a simple structure. More specifically, an optimal transmission strategy exhibits a threshold structure, i.e., the sensor attempts a transmission only when its belief about the channel being in a good state exceeds a threshold that depends on a certain error. Moreover, an optimal estimation strategy follows a `Kalman-like' update rule. When the channel parameters are unknown, we exploit this structure to design an actor-critic reinforcement learning algorithm that converges to a locally optimal policy. Simulations show the learned policy performs close to a globally optimal one, with about a 5.5% average relative gap across evaluated parameters.",

However, the origin statement of Macaulay is in fact regarding the Hilbert function of $I$ itself and the relevant combinatorics explicitly involves the number of variables (i.e. $n$) and does not depend on $d$.\n  In this paper, we provide an elementary proof of the equivalence between these two versions of Macaulay's theorem. The original degree-independent version is more suitable for problems such as those involving sums of polynomial squared norms.\n  Motivated by the Hermitian analogue of Hilbert's 17th problem and proper holomorphic mappings between complex unit balls, some questions lead to the study of Hermitian polynomials $M(z, \\bar{z}) \\in \\mathbb{C}[z_1, \\ldots, z_n, \\bar{z}_1, \\ldots, \\bar{z}_n]$ satisfying $M(z, \\bar{z})\\|z\\|^{2l} = \\|h\\|^2$ for some $l$ and a holomorphic mapping $h = (h_1, \\cdots, h_R)$ .

    "abstract": "It was recently established that the formalism of the generalized transfer operator (GTO) of dynamical systems (DS) theory, applied to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) of arbitrary form, belongs to the family of cohomological topological field theories (TFT) -- a class of models at the intersection of algebraic topology and high-energy physics. This interdisciplinary approach, which can be called the supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS), can be seen as an algebraic dual to the traditional set-theoretic framework of the DS theory, with its algebraic structure enabling the extension of some DS theory concepts to stochastic dynamics. Moreover, it reveals the presence of a topological supersymmetry (TS) in the GTOs of all SDEs. It also shows that among the various definitions of chaos, positive \"pressure\", defined as the logarithm of the GTO spectral radius, stands out as particularly meaningful from a physical perspective, as it corresponds to the spontaneous breakdown of TS on the TFT side. Via the Goldstone theorem, this definition has a potential to provide the long-sought explanation for the experimental signature of chaotic dynamics known as 1/f noise. Additionally, STS clarifies that among the various existing interpretations of SDEs, only the Stratonovich interpretation yields evolution operators that match the corresponding GTOs and, consequently, have a clear-cut mathematical meaning. Here, we discuss these and other aspects of STS from both the DS theory and TFT perspectives, focusing on links between these two fields and providing mathematical concepts with physical interpretations that may be useful in some contexts.",

Despite being arguably the simplest class of disordered quantum systems, the random external field breaks the symmetry of the mean-field Hamiltonian and hence standard quantum de Finetti type or semiclassical arguments are not directly applicable. We introduce a novel strategy in this context, which can be seen as non-commutative large deviation analysis, allowing us to characterize the limiting free energy in terms of a simple and explicit variational formula. The proposed method is general enough to be used for other classes of mean-field models such as multi species Hamiltonians.",

    "abstract": "A robust $hp$-adaptive finite element framework is presented for the investigation of static cracks in materials characterized by complex, pointwise density variations. Within such heterogeneous media, the equilibrium equation governed by the divergence of the stress tensor is reduced to a vector-valued quasilinear partial differential equation, wherein significant gradients and nonlinearities are introduced into the governing constitutive relations by spatial density variations. To ensure that these localized field variables are accurately captured, an automated $hp$-refinement strategy is implemented so that element sizes ($h$) and polynomial degrees ($p$) are concurrently optimized. A dual-indicator approach is employed by the framework. In this approach, $h$-refinement is driven by the Kelly error estimator, which utilizes the jump of the normal derivative across element interfaces, while $p$-refinement is determined by the decay of Legendre-Fourier coefficients to assess the local smoothness of the solution. Optimal convergence rates are ensured by this dual-refinement strategy, particularly within the singular regions surrounding the crack tip where material heterogeneities and geometric discontinuities intersect. The performance of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated across three distinct loading regimes: pure tensile (Mode I), pure shear (Mode II), and mixed-mode loading. It is demonstrated through numerical simulations that the intricate interaction between the fracture process zone and the underlying material heterogeneities is effectively resolved by the $hp$-adaptive scheme. Furthermore, the influence of specific density-dependent constitutive relations on the resulting crack-tip stress fields and strain energy density distributions is analyzed in detail.",

In contrast to the flat Euclidean case $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the geometry of $\\mathbb S^2$ imposes new difficulties, and the fluid dynamics are affected by the curved background. To overcome these challenges, we modify the existing modulation method and employ a set of carefully constructed, time-dependent coordinates that precisely track the shock formation on $\\mathbb{S}^2$.

Within this framework, we implement a detailed bootstrap argument and establish global well-posedness for the self-similar system. After transferring these results back to the original physical system, we thereby demonstrate the finite-time shock formation on $\\mathbb{S}^2$.",

    "abstract": "This paper analyzes a service system modeled as a single-server queue, in which the service provider aims to dynamically maximize the expected revenue per unit of time. This is achieved by constructing a stochastic gradient descent algorithm that dynamically adjusts the price. A key feature of our modeling framework is that customers may choose to balk - that is, decide not to join - when facing high congestion. A notable strength of our approach is that the revenue-maximizing algorithm relies solely on information about effective arrivals, meaning that only the behavior of customers who choose not to balk is observable and used in decision-making. This results in an elaborate interplay between the pricing policy and the effective arrival process, yielding a non-standard state dependent queueing process. An important contribution of our work concerns a novel Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) procedure that is able to consistently estimate the stationary effective arrival rate. This is further leveraged to construct an iterative algorithm that converges, under mild regularity conditions, to the optimal price with provable asymptotic guarantees.",

We develop a three-tier Stackelberg game model to capture the hierarchical strategic interactions among key market entities: a single data buyer, an intermediary broker, and a competitive seller group. To characterize the temporal dynamics of data quality evolution, we establish a coupled system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) where sellers' quality investments interact through mean field effects. Given exogenous pricing policies, we derive approximate Nash equilibrium adjustment strategies for competitive sellers using the mean field game (MFG) approach. The broker's optimal pricing strategy is subsequently established by solving a Stackelberg leadership problem, while the buyer's procurement policy is determined through an optimal control formulation involving conditional mean field forward-backward SDEs (FBSDEs). Under some regularity conditions, the proposed strategies are shown to collectively form an $(\u03b5_1,\u03b5_2,\u03b5_3)$-Stackelberg equilibrium.",

An $\u03b5$-sparsification of the sum involves taking a subset of the $x_i$ and reweighting them by positive scalars, so that the resulting sum is $\u03b5$-close to $e$, where error is measured in a relative sense with respect to the order induced by $K$. This generalizes the influential spectral sparsification model for sums of positive semidefinite matrices.\n  This paper introduces and studies the sparsification function of a convex cone, which measures, in the worst case over all possible sums from the cone, the smallest size of an $\u03b5$-sparsifier. The linear-sized spectral sparsification theorem of Batson, Spielman, and Srivastava can be viewed as a bound on the sparsification function of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. This result is generalized to a family of convex cones (including all hyperbolicity cones) that admit a $\u03bd$-logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier with certain additional properties. For these cones, the sparsification function is bounded above by $\\lceil4\u03bd/\u03b5^2\\rceil$.

    "abstract": "The chromatic number $\u03c7$ of a graph is bounded from below by its clique number $\u03c9,$ but it can be arbitrary large. Perfect graphs are defined by $\u03c7=\u03c9$ for all induced subgraphs. An interesting relaxation are $\u03c7$-bounded graph classes, where $\u03c7\\leq f(\u03c9).$ It is not always possible to achieve this with a polynomial $f.$\n  The edge ideal $I_G$ of a graph $G$ is generated by monomials $x_ux_v$ for each edge $uv$ of $G.$ The bi-graded betti numbers $\u03b2_{i,j}(I)$ are central algebraic geometric invariants. We study the graph classes where for some fixed $i,j$ that syzygy vanishes, that is, $\u03b2_{i,j}(I_G)=0.$\n  We prove that $\u03c7\\leq f(\u03c9),$ where $f$ is a polynomial of degree $2j-2i-4.$ For the elementary special case $\u03b2_{i,2i+2}(I_G)=0,$ this amounts to that $(i+1)K_2$-free graphs are ${\u03c9-1+2i \\choose 2i}$-colorable, improving on an old combinatorial result by Wagon. We also show that triangle-free graphs with $\u03b2_{i,j}(I_G)=0$ are $(j-1)$-colorable.\n  Complexity wise, we show that these colorings can be derived in time $O(n^3)$ for graphs on $n$ vertices. Moreover, we show that for almost all graphs with parabolic $i,j,$ there are better bounds on $\u03c7.$",

    "abstract": "The spectral theory of the p-Laplacian is well developed for classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, but the transitional Robin regime on exterior domains remains largely unexplored. This paper studies a weighted p-Laplacian eigenvalue problem with Robin boundary conditions on the exterior of the unit ball in Euclidean space of dimension N, with N greater than p. The weight function belongs to a critical Lorentz class and decays at infinity. Under natural assumptions on the weight, we prove the existence, uniqueness, simplicity, and isolation of a positive principal eigenvalue and establish local first-order regularity of the associated eigenfunction. We analyze the dependence of the principal eigenvalue on the Robin parameter and recover the Neumann and Dirichlet limits as the parameter approaches zero and infinity, respectively. The far-field behavior of the eigenfunction exhibits a universal algebraic decay rate that is independent of the Robin parameter, while the near-boundary structure displays an explicit scaling with respect to the parameter. We further investigate the gradient behavior of the eigenfunction, showing the existence of a unique critical radius and providing quantitative bounds on both the critical radius and the boundary value in terms of the Robin parameter. The main contribution of this work is the derivation of unified gradient estimates that connect the near-boundary and far-field regions through a characteristic length scale determined by the Robin parameter, yielding a global description of how boundary effects penetrate into the exterior domain.",

    "title": "Regularity analysis and verification of Coons volume mappings",
    "abstract": "The Coons volume provides a classical approach for constructing three-dimensional parametric mappings via boundary surface interpolation and is widely employed in volumetric mesh generation, computer-aided geometric design, and isogeometric analysis. However, due to curvature variations and continuity limitations of the boundary surfaces, the Jacobian determinant of a Coons volume may locally vanish or become negative, resulting in a non-regular mapping. This undermines mesh quality and compromises the stability of subsequent numerical computations. Ensuring the regularity of Coons volumes is therefore critical for robust parametric modeling. This paper develops a systematic framework for analyzing and verifying the regularity of Coons volumes. We first derive a general sufficient condition applicable to arbitrary boundary parameterizations, independent of specific analytical forms. For B\u00e9zier-form Coons volumes, we introduce a criterion based on the B\u00e9zier coefficients of the Jacobian determinant, transforming the verification problem into checking the positivity of control coefficients. Furthermore, we construct a necessary condition by applying a subdivision strategy combined with the B\u00e9zier blossoming technique, ensuring that regularity is preserved in all subdomains. By integrating these conditions, we design an efficient verification algorithm whose correctness and computational performance are validated through numerical experiments. We observe that the regularity of a Coons volume is closely related to the geometric similarity of its opposite boundary surfaces. Moreover, through B\u00e9zier extraction, the algorithm is extended to multi-patch B-spline volumes of arbitrary topology. Numerical tests show that the method completes regularity verification in milliseconds, enabling real-time application.",

First, skill drift imposes an intrinsic ceiling on long-run accuracy (the ``Red Queen'' effect). Second, with period-by-period scale control, the information content of interactions satisfies an invariance principle: under signal-matched scaling, the one-step accuracy transition is independent of matchmaking intensity. Third, the optimal platform policy separates: filtering is implemented by a greedy choice of the gain and rating scale, while matchmaking reduces to a static trade-off between match utility and sorting costs.",

The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with a finite group of the random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\\ge 2$, in the generic case where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \\emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar link problems for all $n\\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem, that he solved for $n=2$. We introduce \\emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \\emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \\emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form.",

The network operates in a time-slotted fashion to serve content-requesting users by streaming cached files. The users being unsatisfied by the multicat streaming face a delivery outage, implying that they will remain interested in their preference at the next time-slot, which leads to a forward dynamics on the user preference. To design a latency-optimal streaming policy, the dynamics of latency is properly modeled and included in the learning procedure. We show that this dynamics surprisingly represents a backward dynamics. The combination of problem's forward and backward dynamics then develops a forward-backward Markov decision process (FB-MDP) that fully captures the network evolution across time. This FB-MDP necessitates usage of a forward-backward multi-objective reinforcement learning (FB-MORL) algorithm to optimize the expected latency as well as other performance metrics of interest including the overall outage probability and total resource consumption. Simulation results show the merit of proposed FB-MORL algorithm in finding a promising dynamic cache policy.",

    "abstract": "For a semiperfect ring with essential socles, the Double annihilator property encodes that the top and socle have anti-isomorphic lattices of submodules, whereas the Size condition encodes that they are isomorphic as modules. Interest in both concepts, particularly for finite rings, was revived by coding theory, where they characterise QF rings and Frobenius rings, respectively. However, their shared origins date back to the work of T. Nakayama.\n  We study these concepts through the lens of the Nakayama permutation, an invariant initially used to define (quasi-)Frobenius rings. We propose semiperfect rings as the setting for this study, treating them as the natural generalisation of finite rings, because they possess the characteristic decomposition of unity preserved by projection onto a semisimple top. This allows us to extend the utility of the Nakayama permutation beyond the classical Artinian setting.\n  By analysing the Nakayama permutation in this broader context, we show that many classical properties of (quasi-)Frobenius rings are not exclusive to the finite case, but are special cases of the general behaviour of semiperfect rings with essential socles.\n  We illustrate these results using B. J. M\u00fcller's representation of semiperfect rings as rings of formal matrices. The clear description of socles and tops in this setting provides a straightforward method for constructing counterexamples, such as quasi-Frobenius rings that are not Frobenius.",

A self-identifying code is a dominating set $S$ where each vertex $u$ (in $G$) is uniquely determined by the intersection $\\bigcap_{c \\in N[u] \\cap S} N[c]$. Let $\u03b3^{\\rm SID}(G)$ denote its minimum size. For these product graphs, we establish new lower and upper bounds on $\u03b3^{\\rm SID}$. Crucially, from these bounds we prove that the asymptotic density $\u03b3^{\\rm SID}(G) / |V(G)|$ of a smallest self-identifying code converges to 1/3 for both families of graphs. This value matches the known asymptotic density of standard identifying codes in the same graphs, as established by Shinde and Waphare. Our result therefore shows that the stronger self-identifying constraint does not necessitate a higher density of vertices in this product setting.",

    "abstract": "Binomial edge ideals associated to a simple graph G were introduced by Herzog and collaborators and, independently, by Ohtani. They became an ``instant classic\" in combinatorial commutative algebra with more than 100 papers devoted to their investigation over the past 15 years. They exhibit many striking properties, including being radical and, moreover, Cartwright-Sturmfels. Using the fact that binomial edge ideals can be seen as ideals of 2-minors of a matrix of variables with two rows, generalized binomial edge ideals of 2-minors of matrices of m rows were introduced by Rauh and proved to be radical. The goal of this paper is to prove that generalized binomial edge ideals are Cartwright-Sturmfels. On the way we provide results on ideal constructions preserving the Cartwright-Sturmfels property. We also give examples and counterexamples to the Cartwright-Sturmfels property for higher minors.",

Optimal transport (OT) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for this task, but existing OT-based approaches often depend on manually selected balancing parameters and can be computationally intensive. In this work, we introduce the Time-integrated Optimal Transport (TiOT) framework, which integrates temporal and feature components into a unified objective and yields a well-defined metric on the space of probability measures. This metric preserves fundamental properties of the Wasserstein distance, while avoiding the need for parameter tuning. To address the corresponding computational challenges, we introduce an entropic regularized approximation of TiOT, which can be efficiently solved using a block coordinate descent algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves improved accuracy and stability while maintaining comparable efficiency.",

In particular, singularly perturbed differential equations exhibit sharp boundary or interior layers with rapid transitions, where standard ML surrogates often fail without extensive resolution. Generating training data for such problems is also costly, as accurate reference solutions typically require massive adaptive mesh refinement. In this work, we propose eFEONet, an enriched Finite Element Operator Network tailored to singularly perturbed problems. Guided by classical singular perturbation theory, eFEONet augments the operator-learning framework with specialized enrichment basis functions that encode the asymptotic structure of layer solutions. This design enables accurate approximation of sharp transitions without relying on large datasets, and can operate with minimal supervision-or even in a data-free manner under appropriate settings. We further provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on representative problems featuring both boundary and interior layers.",

Consequently, if $s=n^{o(1)}$, then $f(G) \\ge n^{5/9-o(1)}$ which polynomially improves the folklore bound $f(G) \\ge n^{1/2-o(1)}$. As a corollary, with high probability, all orientations of the random $n$-vertex graph with edge probability $p=n^{-o(1)}$ (in particular, constant $p$, hence almost all $n$-vertex graphs) satisfy $f(G) \\ge n^{5/9-o(1)}$.

In this first part, the focus is on two aspects.\n  One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring.\n  The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$.

In this paper, we obtain a characterization that applies to a strictly larger class of index sets $T$, based on a methodological extension of Delsarte's original framework (1973). This new characterization naturally recovers classical block designs and orthogonal arrays as special cases. To describe these designs uniformly, we introduce $(r,s)$-designs, a new family of combinatorial objects that arise naturally from our characterization. We also derive absolute lower bounds on the cardinality of $(r,s)$-designs from the multiplicities of the primitive idempotents of the nonbinary Johnson scheme, and construct examples with index $\u03bb=1$ that attain certain natural lower bounds.",

We utilize the intensified Morris-Mitchell criterion, a size-invariant extension of the standard criterion, to quantify and improve input space coverage for existing designs. Using the Python package spotdesirability, we define a multi-objective desirability function that combines predictions from surrogate models (Random Forest) with the Morris-Mitchell improvement into a single score. This approach is demonstrated using a case study from compressor development, optimizing two performance objectives alongside the space-filling criterion. The Python package spotoptim is used for the optimization, and infill-point plots are introduced to visualize the placement of new design points relative to existing ones. This methodology effectively balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off in multi-objective optimization.",

On the other hand, the same function serves as the potential governing the dynamics of the classical homogeneous Kuramoto model. A central question is to identify which graphs induce a benign energy landscape, in the sense that every second-order stationary point is a global minimizer, corresponding to the fully synchronized state. In this case, the graph is said to be globally synchronizing. Most existing results establish global synchronization by relating a given graph to the complete graph, which is known to be globally synchronizing, and by showing that graphs sufficiently close to it inherit this property. In contrast, we uncover a fundamentally different mechanism: global synchronization, despite being a collective phenomenon, unfolds on these graphs through a sequential process of local synchronization that propagates along their structural skeletons. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of the phasor geometry at second-order stationary points of the nonconvex energy landscape.",

We provide an analog of Dwinger's theorem by characterizing Esakia order-compactifications by means of special rings of upsets. These considerations naturally lead to the notion of a locally Esakia space, for which we prove that taking the largest Esakia order-compacification is functorial, thus obtaining an analog of Banaschewski's theorem.",

    "title": "On distance transitive graphs and $4$-geodesic transitive graphs",
    "abstract": "For an integer $s\\geq1$ and a graph $\u0393$, a path $(u_0, u_1, \\ldots, u_{s})$ composed of vertices of $\u0393$ is called an {\\em $s$-geodesic} if it is a shortest path between $u_0$ and $u_s$. We say that $\u0393$ is {\\em $s$-geodesic transitive} if for each $i\\leq s$, $\u0393$ contains at least one $i$-geodesic, and its automorphism group acts transitively on the set of all $i$-geodesics. In this paper, by using the classification of almost simple primitive groups of rank $4$, we first classify all distance transitive graphs of diameter $3$. The resulting classification encompasses $73$ classes of graphs. As an application of this result, we have extended the main result of Jin and Tan [J. Algebra Combin. 60 (2024) 949--963]. More precisely, for a connected $(G,4)$-geodesic transitive graph with a nontrivial intransitive normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ that has at least $3$ orbits, where $G$ is an automorphism group of $\u0393$, it is shown that either both $\u0393$ and $\u0393_N$ are known, or $\u0393$ and $\u0393_N$ have the same girth and $\u0393_N$ is $(G/N,4)$-geodesic transitive.",

    "abstract": "We consider spectral problems for Laplace operator in 3D rod structures with a small cross section of diameter $O(\\varepsilon)$, $\\varepsilon$ being a positive parameter. The boundary conditions are Dirichlet (Neumann, respectively) on the bases of this structure and Neumann on the lateral boundary. As $\\varepsilon\\to 0$, we show the convergence of the spectrum with conservation of the multiplicity towards that of a 1D spectral model with Dirichlet (Neumann, respectively) boundary conditions. This 1D model may arise in diffusion or vibrations models of nonhomogeneous media with different physical characteristics and it takes into account the geometry of the 3D domain. We deal with the low frequencies and the approach to eigenfunctions in the suitable Sobolev spaces is also outlined.",

The $R$-operator is the one obtained by Sun, Terashima, Yagi, and the authors in 2024, involving four quantum dilogarithms with arguments in the $q$-Weyl algebra. The new $K$-operator similarly involves ten such quantum dilogarithms. Our approach is based on the quantum cluster algebra associated with the symmetric butterfly quiver on the wiring diagram of type C.",

We construct four automorphic forms on $\\mathbb{B}_3$ expressing the inverse of the period map, and give an equality between one of them and a period integral, which is an analogy of Jacobi's formula between a theta constant and an elliptic integral. We find a transformation of $\\mathbb{B}_3$ such that the quaternary of means appears by its actions on the four automorphic forms. These results enable us to express the iterated limit by the Lauricella hypergeometric series of type $D$ in three variables.",

The study of pattern-avoiding inversion sequences was initiated in 2015 by Mansour and Shattuck and in 2016 by Corteel, Martinez, Savage and Weselcouch. Martinez and Savage later defined a new type of pattern, a triple of binary relations, of which there are currently 14 uncounted avoidance classes. We complete the enumeration for all of these classes using generating tree methods \"growing on the left\" and \"growing on the right\". For many of these classes we are able to find algebraic generating functions. We also discuss the asymptotic behaviour of the counting sequences.",

This work is inspired by the classical theory of $S$-arithmetic lattices and the flourishing theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups. In this paper - the first of three - we develop various fundamental results, explore elementary subgroups in higher rank, and exhibit a free vs abelian Tits Alternative. Along the way we give representation-theoretic proofs of various results about acylindricity -- some methods are new even in the rank-one setting.\n  The vastness of this class of groups is exhibited by recognizing that it contains $S$-arithmetic lattices with rank-one factors, acylindrically hyperbolic groups, colorable HHGs, groups with property (QT), and enjoys robust stability properties.",
