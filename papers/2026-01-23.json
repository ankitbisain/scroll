    "title": "Visibility of Lattice Points across Polynomials",
    "abstract": "The visibility of lattice points from the origin along a polynomial family of curves constitutes a significant generalization of visibility along straight lines. Following the classical notion, where the density equals 1/2, and its generalization to monomial curves of the form y = a x^b, where the density equals 1/(b+1), we study a family of polynomial curves defined by y = q(a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x), where q is a positive rational number.\n  We introduce a new criterion based on a polynomial greatest common divisor condition that provides a lower bound on the number of visible lattice points in N^2. Conversely, we derive conditions under which a given lattice point becomes the next visible point along such a polynomial curve. Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we also obtain an exact double-sum formula for the number of pairs (a, b) less than or equal to N that are visible with respect to this polynomial family.\n  Finally, we extend the framework to related problems and pose several open questions concerning gap distributions and quantitative bounds for non-visible points. This work provides a broader theoretical foundation for lattice point visibility beyond linear and monomial settings.",

It simultaneously also displays certificates $\u03c3\\in\\mathcal{F}$ for any non-existence of such tangles, or for the non-extendability of low-order tangles to higher-order ones.\n  Our theorem can be applied to produce the structures of the classical tree-of-tangles and tangle-tree duality theorems, both for graph tangles and for their known generalizations to more general separation systems. It extends those theorems to obstruction sets $\\mathcal{F}$ that need not define profiles (as they must in trees of tangles) or consist of stars of separations (as they must in tangle-tree duality).\n  Our existence proof for these structure trees is constructive. The construction has been implemented in open-source software available for tangle detection and further analysis.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that there is a strong connection between entropy inequalities and submodularity, since the entropy of a collection of random variables is a submodular function. Unifying frameworks for information inequalities arising from submodularity were developed by Madiman and Tetali (2010) and Sason (2022). Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions. In this work, we build on these frameworks and make three contributions. First, we establish convex-functional generalizations of the strong and weak Madiman and Tetali inequalities for submodular functions. Second, using a special case of the strong Madiman-Tetali inequality, we derive a new Loomis-Whitney-type projection inequality for finite point sets in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, which improves upon the classical Loomis-Whitney bound by incorporating slice-level structural information. Finally, we study an extremal graph theory problem that recovers and extends the previously known results of Sason (2022) and Boucheron et al., employing Shearer's lemma in contrast to the use of Han's inequality in those works.",

    "abstract": "Pose graph optimization (PGO) is fundamental to robot perception and navigation systems, serving as the mathematical backbone for solving simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Existing solvers suffer from polynomial growth in computational complexity with graph size, hindering real-time deployment in large-scale scenarios. In this paper, by duplicating variables and introducing equality constraints, we reformulate the problem and propose a Parallelizable Riemannian Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (PRADMM) to solve it efficiently. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods that usually exhibit polynomial time complexity growth with graph size, PRADMM enables efficient parallel computation across vertices regardless of graph size. Crucially, all subproblems admit closed-form solutions, ensuring PRADMM maintains exceptionally stable performance. Furthermore, by carefully exploiting the structures of the coefficient matrices in the constraints, we establish the global convergence of PRADMM under mild conditions, enabling larger relaxation step sizes within the interval $(0,2)$. Extensive empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and multiple real-world 3D SLAM benchmarks confirms the superior computational performance of PRADMM.",

The oligomorphic group $\\mathbb{G}$ of order preserving automorphisms of the real line admits exactly four measures. The category $\\mathcal{C}$ associated to the first measure is called the (first) Delannoy category; it is semi-simple and pre-Tannakian, with numerous special properties.\n  In this paper, we study the (non-abelian) category $\\mathcal{A}$ associated to the second measure, which we call the second Delannoy category. We construct a new pre-Tannakian category $\\mathcal{D}$ together with a fully faithful tensor functor $\u03a8\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{D}$. The category $\\mathcal{D}$ is the correct ``abelian version'' of the second Delannoy category. Like $\\mathcal{C}$, it has remarkable properties: for instance, it is non-semi-simple, but behaves uniformly in the coefficient field (e.g., it has the same Grothendieck ring and $\\mathrm{Ext}^1$ quiver over any field).\n  Additionally, we completely solve the problem of understanding how $\\mathcal{A}$ relates to general pre-Tannakian categories. We show that $\\mathcal{A}$ admits exactly two local abelian envelopes: the functor $\u03a8$, and a previously constructed functor $\u03a6\\colon \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathcal{C}$. This is the first case where the local envelopes of a category have been completely determined, outside of cases where there is at most one envelope. This work opens the door to constructing abelian versions of other oligomorphic tensor categories that do not admit a unique envelope.",

This paper surveys the development and mathematical foundations, in particular, regarding bounds and constructions of rank-metric codes, emphasizing their extension beyond finite fields to more general settings. We examine Singleton-like bounds on code parameters, demonstrating their sharpness in finite field cases and contrasting this with contexts where the bounds are not tight. Furthermore, we discuss constructions of Maximum Rank Distance (MRD) codes over fields with cyclic Galois extensions and the relationship between linear rank-metric codes with systems and evasive subspaces. The paper also reviews results for algebraically closed fields and real numbers, previously appearing in the context of topology and measure theory. We conclude by proposing future research directions, including conjectures on MRD code existence and the exploration of rank-metric codes over various field extensions.",

The resulting dynamics are described in terms of a non-autonomous stochastic evolution equation governed by maximally monotone operators in the drift and perturbed by a Brownian motion. We study the asymptotic behavior, as well as finite time convergence rates in terms of gap functions. The condition we use to prove convergence involves a Legendre transform of the function describing the set C, a condition first used by Attouch and Czarnecki (J. Differ. Equations, Vol. 248, Issue 6, 2010) in the context of deterministic evolution equations. We also establish a large deviations principle showing that individual trajectories exhibit exponential concentration around the solution set.

    "abstract": "In 2012, K. Matsuda introduced the class of weakly closed graphs and investigated when binomial edge ideals are F-pure. He proved that weakly closed binomial edge ideals are F-pure whenever the base field has positive characteristic. He conjectured that: (i) when the base field has characteristic two, every F-pure binomial edge ideal comes from a weakly closed graph; and (ii) that every binomial edge ideal is F-pure provided that the characteristic of the residue field is sufficiently large.\n  In this paper, we resolve both of Matsuda's conjectures. We confirm Matsuda's first conjecture, showing that the binomial edge ideal of a graph defines an F-pure quotient in characteristic 2 if and only if the graph is weakly closed. We also show that Matsuda's second conjecture is false in a very strong way by showing that graphs containing asteroidal triples, such as the net, define non-F-pure binomial edge ideals in any positive characteristic. Our results yield a complete classification of F-pure binomial edge ideals of chordal graphs as well as large families of standard graded algebras that are F-injective but neither F-pure nor F-rational in all characteristics.",

We say that $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable if for every $f$-list assignment $L$ of $G$, there exists a proper conflict-free $L$-coloring of $G$. If $G$ is proper conflict-free $f$-choosable and there is a constant $k$ such that $f(v)= d_G(v)+k$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$, then we say $G$ is proper conflict-free $({\\rm degree}+k)$-choosable.

This leads to the definition of 2-equivariant 2K-theory as the Grothendieck group of the internal equivalence classes in the bicategory.

    "abstract": "Set Shaping Theory (SST) moves beyond the classical fixed-space model by constructing bijective mappings the original sequence set into structured regions of a larger sequence space. These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) < NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences. Finally, to ensure full reproducibility, the software implementing the proposed method has been made publicly available on GitHub, enabling independent verification of the results reported in this work",

For a given prime number $p_n$, we consider the sums \\[ S_k(p_n) = p_n + p_{n+1} + \\cdots + p_{n+k-1}, \\] where $k \\ge 3$ is an odd integer. We first formulate an existence conjecture asserting that, for every prime number $p_n$, there exists at least one odd length $k \\ge 3$ such that $S_k(p_n)$ is itself a prime number. An exhaustive computational verification covering the first one million prime numbers revealed no counterexamples. We then propose a strengthened conjecture according to which, for every prime number $p_n$, there exist infinitely many odd lengths $k$ such that $S_k(p_n)$ is prime. This strong version is supported by a probabilistic heuristic showing that the series of the corresponding primality probabilities diverges, suggesting that the phenomenon is not exceptional but recurrent. We also analyze the possible modular obstructions, showing that they are local in nature and cannot persist when the length $k$ varies among odd integers. A Diophantine interpretation of the problem is proposed, together with a conceptual comparison with the generalized Goldbach conjecture. Finally, we discuss the role of the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH) in controlling the distribution of the sums under consideration. These structural, modular, Diophantine, and probabilistic (heuristic) arguments support both conjectures and formalize heuristic theorems of Cram\u00e9r, GRH, and Hardy--Littlewood type explaining the expected absence of counterexamples.",

We establish optimality characterizations for the game and present variants of value iteration and policy iteration to solve the game. Using lead distance data, we estimate generalized linear mixed-effects models for pickoff and stolen base outcome probabilities given lead distance, context, and player skill. We compute the game-theoretic equilibria under the two-player model, as well as the optimal runner policy under a simplified one-player Markov decision process (MDP) model.

Our main result is an example of this: we classify the $G$-universes $\\mathcal{U}$ for which the linear isometries operad $\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{U})$ and the infinite little discs operad $\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{U})$ are homotopically equivalent. To achieve this, we use ideas that originate from the work of Balchin-Barnes-Roitzheim on the combinatorics of transfer systems on a total order. Additionally, the use of transfer systems gives us insight into the algebraic structures that arise from equivariant homotopy theory. Compatible pairs of transfer systems provide rules for when multiplicative transfer maps can be paired with additive transfer maps. In the case that the group $G$ is abelian, we provide conditions for when the pair $(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{U}),\\mathcal{D}(\\mathcal{U}))$ defines a maximally compatible pair of transfer systems. As a consequence, we contribute to a recent conjecture about equivariant operad pairs.",

Implementation of a theoretically justified asymptotic expansion, from [33], using the eigensystem of the Newtonian operator, with error analysis for the spectral truncation.\n  2.

For spreading bases (which need not be unconditional or even Schauder bases), we develop new techniques involving the geometry of spreading sequences and their associated spreading models. We prove that any spreading basis is automatically seminormalized, M-bounded, and uniformly spreading, which allows the construction of an isometric renorming via its spreading model. For symmetric bases, we show they are necessarily spreading and uniformly symmetric, enabling a direct application of a renorming lemma for uniformly bounded semigroups of operators. Consequently, any quasi-Banach space with a symmetric basis admits a renorming making all permutations isometries, and any spreading basis admits a renorming making all increasing maps isometries. These results extend and unify classical isometric renorming theorems for unconditional, subsymmetric, and symmetric Schauder bases to the conditional, non-Schauder setting.",

We show that the mode transition algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 admit unity elements that form a family of strong unities in the sense of Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen. The existence of unities for the mode transition algebra of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 allows us to explicitly construct all higher level Zhu algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2. We further analyze weak modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 induced from Zhu algebras, proving that every such module is already induced from the level-zero Zhu algebra. We then prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules induced from a Zhu algebra are not weakly interlocked, and hence not strongly interlocked in the sense of Barron-Batistelli-Orosz Hunziker-Yamskulna. More generally, we show that the property of being weakly interlocked is preserved under the action of an invertible Li's $\\mathbf\u0394$ operator. As an application, we prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 obtained via spectral flow of Zhu-induced modules are likewise not weakly interlocked.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a 3-dimensional free boundary problem modeling tumor growth with the Robin boundary condition. The system involves a positive parameter $\u03bc$ which reflects the intensity of tumor aggressiveness. Huang, Zhang and Hu [Nonlinear Anal. Real World Appl. 2017(35), 483-502] have shown that for each $\u03bc_n$ ($n$ even) in a strictly increasing sequence $\\{ \u03bc_n \\}(n\\geq 2)$, there exists a stationary bifurcation solution $(\u03c3_n(\\varepsilon),p_n(\\varepsilon),r_n(\\varepsilon))$ with $\u03bc= \u03bc_n(\\varepsilon)$ bifurcating from $\u03bc_n$. We first derive that the bifurcation curve $(r_2(\\varepsilon),\u03bc_2(\\varepsilon))$ exhibits a transcritical bifurcation with $\u03bc_2'(0)<0$. Moreover, we show that the stationary bifurcation solution $(\u03c3_2(\\varepsilon),p_2(\\varepsilon),r_2(\\varepsilon))$ is linearly unstable for small $|\\varepsilon|$ under non-radially symmetric perturbations. In contrast to the linear stability of the radially symmetric stationary solution, the lack of explicit expressions for bifurcation solutions adds great difficulty in analyzing their linear stability. The novelty of this paper lies in the use of the bifurcation curve's structure to overcome the above difficulties. Moreover, this linear stability result is not established using the standard method, due to an eight-dimensional generalized kernel at eigenvalue 0 for the linearized operator.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical Bayesian models are increasingly used in large, inhomogeneous complex network dynamical systems by modeling parameters as draws from a hyperparameter-governed distribution. However, theoretical guarantees for these estimates as the system size grows have been lacking. A critical concern is that hyperparameter estimation may diverge for larger networks, undermining the model's reliability. Formulating the system's evolution in a measure transport perspective, we propose a theoretical framework for estimating hyperparameters with mean-type observations, which are prevalent in many scientific applications. Our primary contribution is a nonasymptotic bound for the deviation of estimate of hyperparameters in inhomogeneous complex network dynamical systems with respect to network population size, which is established for a general family of optimization algorithms within a fixed observation duration. While we firstly establish a consistency result for systems with independent nodes, our main result extends this guarantee to the more challenging and realistic setting of weakly-dependent nodes. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on two representative models: a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible model and a Spiking Neuronal Network model. In both cases, the results confirm that the estimation error decreases as the network population size increases, aligning with our theoretical guarantees. This research proposes the foundational theory to ensure that hierarchical Bayesian methods are statistically consistent for large-scale inhomogeneous systems, filling a gap in this area of theoretical research and justifying their application in practice.",

    "abstract": "Tangent category theory is a well-established categorical framework for differential geometry. A long list of fundamental geometric constructions, such as the tangent bundle functor, vector fields, Euclidean spaces, and vector bundles have been successfully generalized and internalized within tangent categories. Over the past decade, the theory has also been extended in several directions, yielding concepts such as tangent monads, tangent fibrations, tangent restriction categories, and reverse tangent categories. It is natural to wonder how these new flavours of the theory interact with the geometric constructions. How does a tangent monad or a tangent fibration lift to the tangent category of differential bundles of a tangent category? What is the correct notion of connections for a tangent restriction category? In previous work, we introduced tangentads, a unifying framework that generalizes many tangent-like notions, and developed a formal theory of vector fields for tangentads. In this paper, we extend this formal theory to three further fundamental constructions. These are differential objects, which generalize Euclidean spaces, differential bundles, which represent vector bundles in tangent category theory, and connections on differential bundles, which are the analogue of Koszul connections. These notions are introduced in the general theory of tangentads via appropriate universal properties. We then extend some of the main results of tangent category theory, including the equivalence between differential objects and differential bundles over the terminal object, and show that connections admit well-defined notions of covariant derivative, curvature, and torsion. Finally, we construct connections using PIE limits and apply our framework to several concrete instances of tangentads.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new family of polar-like codes, called Partially Polarized Polar (PPP) codes. PPP codes are constructed from conventional polar codes by selectively pruning polarization kernels, thereby modifying the synthesized bit-channel capacities to ensure a guaranteed number of non-frozen bits available early in decoding. These early-access information bits enable more effective early termination, which is particularly valuable for blind decoding in downlink control channels, where user equipment (UE) must process multiple candidates, many of which carry no valid control information. Our results show that PPP codes offer substantial performance gains over conventional polar codes, particularly at larger block lengths where hardware limitations restrict straightforward scaling. Compared with existing methods such as aggregation or segmentation, PPP codes achieve higher efficiency without the need for additional hardware support. Finally, we propose several frozen-bitmap design strategies tailored to PPP codes.",

Efficient statistical models focus on coarse communication-centric metrics, and therefore miss the weak but critical multipath signatures for sensing, whereas deterministic models are computationally inefficient to scale for system-level ISAC evaluation. This gap calls for a unifying abstraction that can couple what the environment means for sensing with how the channel behaves for communication, namely, environmental semantics. This article clarifies the meaning and essentiality of environmental semantics in ISAC channel modeling and establishes how semantics is connected to observable channel structures across multiple semantic levels. Based on this perspective, a semantics-oriented channel modeling principle was advocated, which preserves environmental semantics while abstracting unnecessary detail to balance accuracy and complexity. Then, a generative AI-empowered semantic twin channel model (STCM) was introduced to generate a family of physically plausible channel realizations representative of a semantic condition. Case studies further show semantic consistency under challenging multi-view settings, suggesting a practical path to controllable simulation, dataset generation, and reproducible ISAC benchmarking toward future design and standardization.",

We also provide a complete characterization of the optimal policy for Markovian systems with two stations and two servers when each server's efficiency may be task dependent. We show that the throughput is maximized under the policy which assigns one server to each station (based on their relative skill at that station) unless station 2 has no work (in which case both servers work at station 1) or the number of customers in the buffer reaches a threshold whose value we characterize (in which case both servers work at station 2). We study how the optimal policy varies with the level of server synergy (including no synergy) and also compare the optimal policy for systems with different customer abandonment rates (including no abandonments). Finally, we investigate the case where the synergy among collaborating servers can be task-dependent and provide numerical results.",

Coded shifts are natural generalizations of sofic shifts and are defined as the closure of all bi-infinite concatenations of words (generators) drawn from a countable generating set $\\mathcal{G}$. We begin by establishing a computability criterion for $\\mathcal{G}$-Bernoulli measures which are invariant measures given by assigning probability weights to the generators. We then apply this criterion to the setting in which the concatenation entropy exceeds the residual entropy, showing that in this case the unique measure of maximal entropy $\u03bc_{\\rm max}$ on $X$ is computable, provided the Vere--Jones parameter $\u03ba$ of $\\mathcal{G}$ is computable, based on having oracle access to the generators and the language of $X$. As a consequence, the unique MME is computable for several well-known classes of shift spaces, including $S$-gap shifts, multiple-gap shifts, and $\u03b2$-shifts. Moreover, the two ergodic MMEs of the Dyck shift are also computable. Finally, we examine the opposite situation, where the residual entropy exceeds the concatenation entropy and the MME is known to be non-unique in general. We show that even when $\u03bc_{\\rm max}$ is unique and the parameter $\u03ba$ is computable, the measure $\u03bc_{\\rm max}$ may still fail to be computable.",

For a fixed projection, crossing assignments are encoded by bit data, and an immediate Reidemeister~II reduction supported by a bigon face is characterized directly in terms of these bits. The genus-one generalized Kauffman-type bracket is then evaluated as a state sum entirely within the permutation model, without drawing diagrams in a fundamental polygon.\n  The implementation is validated against published genus-one classifications for $N\\le 5$ under explicit comparison conventions, with remaining discrepancies explained at the level of global conventions. Beyond the published range, we compute projection and diagram data for crossing numbers up to $N=8$ and provide a public reference implementation together with machine-readable datasets.

We generalize this induced-channel viewpoint to arbitrary stabilizer codes used purely as channel transforms. Given any $ [\\![ n, k ]\\!] $ stabilizer generator set, we construct a full symplectic tableau, compute the induced joint distribution of logical Pauli errors and syndromes under the physical Pauli channel, and obtain an achievable rate via a hashing bound with decoder side information.

The rotations involved are discretized using suitable quadrature rules. This framework includes classical constructions such as spherical needlets and directional wavelet systems, and at the same time permits the systematic design of new frames with adjustable spatial localization, directional sensitivity, and computational complexity. We show that a number of frame properties can be characterized in terms of simple, easily verifiable conditions on the Fourier coefficients of the functions $\u03a8^j$. Extending an earlier result for zonal systems, we establish sufficient conditions under which the frame functions are optimally localized in space with respect to a spherical uncertainty principle, thus making the corresponding systems a viable tool for position-frequency analyses. To conclude this article, we explicitly discuss examples of well-localized and highly directional polynomial frames.",

Our main result shows that much of the general theory of multipliers is approachable through the theory of unimodular multipliers. Indeed, we show that a bounded measurable function $m$ is a multiplier on $L^p$ for $1\\leq p<\\infty$ if and only if $e^{itm}$ is a multiplier on $L^p$ and its multiplier norm admits an exponential bound of the form $e^{c|t|^s}$ for suitable $c>0$ and $0<s<1$. We then apply this principle to obtain new results related to the boundedness of homogeneous rough operators, singular operators along curves and oscillatory integrals.

In this work, we introduce Recursive Flow (RC-Flow), a novel solver that leverages pre-trained flow matching priors to robustly recover channel state information from noisy, under-determined measurements. Different from conventional open-loop generative models, our approach establishes a closed-loop refinement framework via a serial restart mechanism and anchored trajectory rectification. By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. Theoretically, we analyze the Jacobian spectral radius of the recursive operator to prove its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results demonstrate that RC-Flow reduces inference latency by two orders of magnitude while achieving a 2.7 dB performance gain in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes compared to the score-based baseline.",

Indeed, we confirm the well-known conjecture that Chebyshev polynomials are the only complex polynomials whose geometric iterated Galois groups have positive fixed-point proportion. Our proof relies on methods from group theory, ergodic theory, martingale theory and complex dynamics. This result has direct applications to the proportion of periodic points of polynomials over finite fields.\n  The general framework developed in this paper applies more generally to rational functions over arbitrary fields and generalizes, via a unified approach, previous partial results, which have all been proved with very different methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we prove a Pohozaev identity for the Spectral Fractional Laplacian (SFL). This identity allows us to establish non-existence results for the semilinear Dirichlet problem $(-\u0394|_\u03a9)^su = f(u)$ in star-shaped domains. The first such identity for non-local operators was established by Ros-Oton and Serra in 2014 for the Restricted Fractional Laplacian (RFL). However, the SFL differs fundamentally from the RFL, and the integration by parts strategy of Ros-Oton and Serra cannot be applied. Instead, we develop a novel spectral approach that exploits the underlying quadratic structure. Our main result expresses the identity as a Schur product of the classical Pohozaev quadratic form and a transition matrix that depends on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian and the fractional exponent.",

Our aim is to seek efficient task-allocation and data-communication techniques that reduce computation and communication costs. Towards this, we take a tensor-theoretic approach, in which we represent the requested non-linearly decomposable functions using a properly designed tensor $\\bar{\\mathcal{F}}$, whose sparse decomposition into a tensor $\\bar{\\mathcal{E}}$ and matrix $\\mathbf{D}$ directly defines the task assignment, connectivity, and communication patterns. We here design an achievable scheme, employing novel fixed-support SVD-based tensor factorization methods and careful multi-dimensional tiling of subtensors, yielding computation and communication protocols whose costs are derived here, and which are shown to perform substantially better than the state of art.",

We first extend the filter method for uniform Fourier data to the non-uniform setting by using the techniques of admissible frames. We show that the proposed non-uniform filter method converges exponentially away from the jump discontinuities. However, the convergence rate is significantly slower near the jump discontinuities due to the Gibbs phenomenon. To overcome this issue, we combine the non-uniform filter method with a stable extrapolation method to recover the function values near the jump discontinuities. We show that the proposed hybrid method could achieve exponential accuracy uniformly on the entire domain. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.",

The active condition of position constraints is derived, which is absent from the literature. An efficient algorithm is proposed, capable of planning time-optimal trajectories under asymmetric full constraints and arbitrary boundary states, with a 100% success rate.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the minimax-optimality of Halpern fixed-point iterations for Lipschitz maps in general normed spaces. Starting from an a priori bound on the orbit of iterates, we derive non-asymptotic estimates for the fixed-point residuals. These bounds are tight, meaning that they are attained by a suitable Lipschitz map and an associated Halpern sequence. By minimizing these tight bounds we identify the minimax-optimal Halpern scheme. For contractions, the optimal iteration exhibits a transition from an initial Halpern phase to the classical Banach-Picard iteration and, as the Lipschitz constant approaches one, we recover the known convergence rate for nonexpansive maps. For expansive maps, the algorithm is purely Halpern with no Banach-Picard phase; moreover, on bounded domains, the residual estimates converge to the minimal displacement bound. Inspired by the minimax-optimal iteration, we design an adaptive scheme whose residuals are uniformly smaller than the minimax-optimal bounds, and can be significantly sharper in practice. Finally, we extend the analysis by introducing alternative bounds based on the distance to a fixed point, which allow us to handle mappings on unbounded domains; including the case of affine maps for which we also identify the minimax-optimal iteration.",

For the pure models, the measure concentrates on spherical bands around critical points that approximately maximize the energy at a particular radius. Next, we present another approach in which a similar picture is derived for general mixed models. At the core of this approach is a free energy functional computed over bands using multiple orthogonal replicas, satisfying a strong concentration of measure. We discuss several implications of this method for a generalized Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) approach. Finally, we explain how these geometric insights inform optimization algorithms, and briefly relate them to Smale's 17th problem over the real numbers.",

The final score of each player is defined as the sum of the scores obtained in matches against all other players.

Even though the geometric structures for this are obvious and some works already use an exponential algorithm, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no canonical structure of the LLG equation for the exponential update algorithm in micromagnetism. Tensor algebraic reformulations of the LLG equation allow the canonical representation of the evolution equation for the magnetization, which serves as the basis for different integrators.

    "title": "Fully Functional Weighted Testing for Abrupt and Gradual Location Changes in Functional Time Series",
    "abstract": "Change point tests for abrupt changes in the mean of functional data, i.e., random elements in infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, are either based on dimension reduction techniques, e.g., based on principal components, or directly based on a functional CUSUM (cumulative sum) statistic. The former have often been criticized as not being fully functional and losing too much information. On the other hand, unlike the latter, they take the covariance structure of the data into account by weighting the CUSUM statistics obtained after dimension reduction with the inverse covariance matrix. In this paper, as a middle ground between these two approaches, we propose an alternative statistic that includes the covariance structure with an offset parameter to produce a scale-invariant test procedure and to increase power when the change is not aligned with the first components. We obtain the asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis for this new test statistic, allowing for time dependence of the data. Furthermore, we introduce versions of all three test statistics for gradual change situations, which have not been previously considered for functional data, and derive their limit distribution. Further results shed light on the asymptotic power behavior for all test statistics under various ground truths for the alternatives.",

    "abstract": "The low-altitude economy is integral to the advancement of numerous sectors, necessitating the development of advanced low-altitude surveillance techniques. Nevertheless, conventional methods encounter limitations of high deployment costs and low signal strength. This study proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network for low-altitude surveillance. This network employs RISs to reflect ISAC signals into low-altitude space for sensing. To enhance signal strength, we employ active RIS (ARIS) to amplify the signals. Moreover, in order to avoid error propagation and data association in traditional sensing methods, we model low-altitude surveillance as an imaging problem based on compressed sensing theory, which can be solved through the subspace pursuit algorithm. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed RIS-aided low-altitude imaging system and analyze the impacts of various system parameters on sensing performance, providing guidance for ISAC system configuration. Numerical results show that ARIS outperforms passive RIS under identical power constraints, achieving effective imaging and target detection at altitudes up to 300 meters.",

    "abstract": "In constrained stochastic optimization, one naturally expects that imposing a stricter feasible set does not increase the statistical risk of an estimator defined by projection onto that set. In this paper, we show that this intuition can fail even in canonical settings.\n  We study the Gaussian sequence model, a deliberately austere test best, where for a compact, convex set $\u0398\\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ one observes \\[ Y = \u03b8^\\star + \u03c3Z, \\qquad Z \\sim N(0, I_d), \\] and seeks to estimate an unknown parameter $\u03b8^\\star \\in \u0398$. The natural estimator is the least squares estimator (LSE), which coincides with the Euclidean projection of $Y$ onto $\u0398$. We construct an explicit example exhibiting \\emph{risk reversal}: for sufficiently large noise, there exist nested compact convex sets $\u0398_S \\subset \u0398_L$ and a parameter $\u03b8^\\star \\in \u0398_S$ such that the LSE constrained to $\u0398_S$ has strictly larger risk than the LSE constrained to $\u0398_L$. We further show that this phenomenon can persist at the level of worst-case risk, with the supremum risk over the smaller constraint set exceeding that over the larger one.\n  We clarify this behavior by contrasting noise regimes. In the vanishing-noise limit, the risk admits a first-order expansion governed by the statistical dimension of the tangent cone at $\u03b8^\\star$, and tighter constraints uniformly reduce risk. In contrast, in the diverging-noise regime, the risk is determined by global geometric interactions between the constraint set and random noise directions. Here, the embedding of $\u0398_S$ within $\u0398_L$ can reverse the risk ordering.\n  These results reveal a previously unrecognized failure mode of projection-based estimators: in sufficiently noisy settings, tightening a constraint can paradoxically degrade statistical performance.",

    "abstract": "Real-time fluid and aeroacoustic simulation on complex surfaces can have interactive applications - from globe-based weather visualizations to immersive computer games with physically accurate wind and sound. However, conventional grid-based solvers struggle with numerical instability near surface singularities, and mesh-based approaches lack a straightforward path to solving partial differential equations (PDEs) with stable, high-order accuracy.\n  Our model presents a unified framework for real-time inviscid fluid simulation and aeroacoustics on spherical surfaces with embedded obstacles, combining the Closest Point Method (CPM), projection-based Navier-Stokes solvers, and the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings (FWH) analogy. CPM enables surface PDEs to be solved in a Cartesian embedding without parametrization by restricting computation to a narrow band around the sphere. Each band point is mapped to its nearest surface location, where band operators project results onto the local tangent space. Surface obstacles are modelled with signed distance functions (SDFs), enforcing no-slip velocity constraints and Bernoulli-based pressure adjustments for consistent real-world boundary interactions. Aeroacoustic sources are computed directly from surface pressure force derivatives and mapped to real-time audio via frequency and amplitude modulation with artifact-suppressing hysteresis smoothing.\n  Our findings from this model simulate the behaviour of inviscid fluid on spherical surfaces while generating sound using the pressure of the fluid flowing on the surface. This approach gives results that offer stability, geometric consistency, and support applications in scientific visualization, virtual reality, and educational tools.",

Most existing approaches for code-identification are contingent upon the codes in the family having some special structure, and are often computationally expensive otherwise. Further, rigorous analytical guarantees on the performance of these existing techniques are largely absent. This work presents a new method for code-identification on the binary symmetric channel (BSC), inspired by the framework of subspace codes for operator channels, carefully combining principles of hamming-metric and subspace-metric decoding. We refer to this method as the minimum denoised subspace discrepancy decoder. We present theoretical guarantees for code-identification using this decoder, for bounded-weight errors, and also present a bound on the probability of error when used on the BSC. Simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our decoder for random linear codes beyond existing general-purpose techniques, across most channel conditions and even with a limited number of received vectors.",

The problem incorporates three key compartment-related features: (i) compartment flexibility in the number of compartments, (ii) item-to-compartment compatibility, and (iii) item-to-item compatibility. The problem also accommodates practical operational requirements such as driver breaks. To solve the MCVRPMTW, we develop an exact branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm in which the pricing problem is solved using a labeling algorithm. Several acceleration strategies are introduced to limit symmetry during label extensions, improve the stability of dual solutions in column generation, and enhance the branching process. To handle large-scale instances, we propose a rolling-space B&P algorithm that integrates clustering techniques into the solution framework. Extensive computational experiments on instances inspired by a real-world industrial application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide useful managerial insights for practical implementation.",

Based on these foundations, we develop graph-theoretic criteria for solvability, nilpotency, presence of ideals, simplicity, semisimplicity, and reductiveness of an algebra. Practical algorithms are provided for constructing such graphs and those associated with the lower central series and derived series via an iterative pruning procedure. This visual framework allows for an intuitive understanding of Lie algebraic structures that goes beyond purely visual advantages, since it enables a simpler and swifter grasping of the algebras of interest beyond computational-heavy approaches. Examples, which include the Schr\u00f6dinger and Lorentz algebra, illustrate the applicability of these tools to physically relevant cases. We further explore applications in physics, where the method facilitates computation of similtude relations essential for determining quantum mechanical time evolution via the Lie algebraic factorization method.

Building on their results, we encode the required hypotheses into an explicit algorithm and apply it to the database of elliptic curves in the $L$-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), identifying all elliptic curves $E$ of conductor at most $500{,}000$ that admit infinitely many quadratic twists satisfying the strong BSD conjecture. Our computations provide certain numerical evidence for a conjecture of Radziwi\u0142\u0142 and Soundararajan predicting Gaussian behavior in the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group, while also observing a systematic positive bias within the BSD-satisfying subfamily.",

    "title": "Tri-Hybrid Beamforming Design for integrated Sensing and Communications",
    "abstract": "Tri-hybrid beamforming architectures have been proposed to enable energy-efficient communications systems in extra-largescale antenna arrays using low-cost programmable metasurface antennas. We study the tri-hybrid beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to improve both communications and sensing performances. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances communications signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the sensing power at a target direction, subject to constraints on the total power consumption and physical limitations inherent to the trihybrid beamforming architecture. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm in which the variables are updated in a closed form at each iteration, leading to a low-complexity and fast-execution design. Numerical results show that the tri-hybrid architecture improves spatial gain and energy efficiency, though with reduced beam alignment capability compared to conventional hybrid beamforming architectures.",

    "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the study of the T-tensor associated with a spherically symmetric Finsler metric $F=u\u03c6(r,s)$ on \\(\\mathbb{R}^n\\). We derive a general expression for the T-tensor in terms of the scalar function \\(\u03c6(r, s)\\) and its partial derivatives. Furthermore, we characterize all spherically symmetric Finsler metrics satisfying the so-called T-condition, that is, those for which the T-tensor vanishes. In addition, we obtain the formula for the mean Cartan tensor and demonstrate that all spherically symmetric Finsler metrics of dimension $n \\geq 3$, with a non-zero mean Cartan tensor are quasi-C-reducible.",

We calculate several examples including paths, cycles and star graphs, and we show that the $p$-curvature is non-negative at some vertices in the case $p\\geq 2$, while it approaches to $-\\infty$ in the case of $1<p<2$. In addition, we observe that a crucial property of $\u0393_2$ on Cartesian products does no longer hold for $\u0393_2^p$ in the case of $p > 2$. As a consequence, an analogous proof that non-negative curvature is preserved under taking Cartesian products is not possible for $p > 2$.",

For this restricted set of saddle connections, we show that it satisfies an $L (\\log L)^{d-2}$ growth rate, where $d$ is the complex dimension of the hyperelliptic stratum. The upper bound holds for all translation surfaces in the hyperelliptic stratum while the lower bound holds for almost every surface in the hyperelliptic stratum.

The algorithm uses various pruning techniques to avoid having to first generate all labeled realizations of the input sequence and then testing whether each labeled realization is triangle-free. It can be further extended to generate all labeled bipartite graphs with a given graphical degree sequence by adding a simple test whether each generated triangle-free realization is a bipartite graph. All output graphs are generated in the lexicographical ordering as in the original algorithm. The algorithms can also be easily parallelized.",

The method applies stochastic gradient ascent to a surrogate objective obtained by first performing a power transformation and then Gaussian smoothing, $F_{N,\u03c3}(\\bm\u03bc):=\\mathbb{E}_{\\bm{w}\\sim\\mathcal{N}(\\bm\u03bc,\u03c3^2I_d),\\bm{x}\\sim\\mathcal{D}}[e^{Nf_w(\\bm{x})}]$, while progressively increasing the power parameter $N$ and decreasing the smoothing scale $\u03c3$ along the optimization trajectory. We prove that, under mild regularity conditions, Prog-PowerHP converges to a small neighborhood of the global optimum with an iteration complexity scaling nearly as $O(d^2\\varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirically, Prog-PowerHP demonstrates clear advantages in phase retrieval when the samples-to-dimension ratio approaches the information-theoretic limit, and in training two-layer neural networks in under-parameterized regimes. These results suggest that Prog-PowerHP is particularly effective for navigating cluttered non-convex landscapes where standard first-order methods struggle.",

The solution of a boundary-value problem for a stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the unit ball can be studied from a variational perspective. In this variational formulation, a Sobolev inner product naturally arises. As test functions, we consider the linear space of the polynomials satisfying the boundary conditions on the sphere, and a basis of mutually orthogonal polynomials with respect to the Sobolev inner product is provided. The basis of the proposed method is given in terms of spherical harmonics and univariate Sobolev orthogonal polynomials. The connection formula between these Sobolev orthogonal polynomials and the classical orthogonal polynomials on the ball is established. Consequently, the Sobolev Fourier coefficients of a function satisfying the boundary value problem are recursively derived. Finally, one numerical experiment is presented.",
