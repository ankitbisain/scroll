    "title": "Variational (Energy-Based) Spectral Learning: A Machine Learning Framework for Solving Partial Differential Equations",
    "abstract": "We introduce variational spectral learning (VSL), a machine learning framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that operates directly in the coefficient space of spectral expansions. VSL offers a principled bridge between variational PDE theory, spectral discretization, and contemporary machine learning practice. The core idea is to recast a given PDE \\[ \\mathcal{L}u = f \\quad \\text{in} \\quad Q=\u03a9\\times(0,T), \\] together with boundary and initial conditions, into differentiable space--time energies built from strong-form least-squares residuals and weak (Galerkin) formulations. The solution is represented as a finite spectral expansion \\[ u_N(x,t)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n\\,\u03c6_n(x,t), \\] where $\u03c6_n$ are tensor-product Chebyshev bases in space and time, with Dirichlet-satisfying spatial modes enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions analytically. This yields a compact linear parameterization in the coefficient vector $\\mathbf{c}$, while all PDE complexity is absorbed into the variational energy. We show how to construct strong-form and weak-form space-time functionals, augment them with initial-condition and Tikhonov regularization terms, and minimize the resulting objective with gradient-based optimization. In practice, VSL is implemented in TensorFlow using automatic differentiation and Keras cosine-decay-with-restarts learning-rate schedules, enabling robust optimization of moderately sized coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments on benchmark elliptic and parabolic problems, including one- and two-dimensional Poisson, diffusion, and Burgers-type equations, demonstrate that VSL attains accuracy comparable to classical spectral collocation with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, while providing a differentiable objective suitable for modern optimization tooling.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents the application of a novel data-driven adaptive control technique, called dynamic mode adaptive control (DMAC), for regulating thrust in a solid fuel ramjet (SFRJ). A high-fidelity computational model incorporating compressible flow theory and equilibrium chemistry is used to simulate the combustion dynamics. An adaptive tracking controller is designed using the DMAC framework, which leverages dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the local system behavior, followed by a tracking controller synthesized around the identified model. Simulation results demonstrate that DMAC provides an effective and reliable approach for thrust regulation in SFRJs. In addition, a systematic hyperparameter sensitivity study is conducted by varying the tuning parameters over several orders of magnitude. The resulting responses show that the closed-loop performance and tracking error remain stable across wide parameter variations, indicating that DMAC exhibits strong robustness to hyper parameter tuning.",

    "abstract": "Community detection seeks to recover mesoscopic structure from network data that may be binary, count-valued, signed, directed, weighted, or multilayer. The stochastic block model (SBM) explains such structure by positing a latent partition of nodes and block-specific edge distributions. In Bayesian SBMs, standard MCMC alternates between updating the partition and sampling block parameters, which can hinder mixing and complicate principled comparison across different partitions and numbers of communities. We develop a collapsed Bayesian SBM framework in which block-specific nuisance parameters are analytically integrated out under conjugate priors, so the marginal likelihood p(Y|z) depends only on the partition z and blockwise sufficient statistics. This yields fast local Gibbs/Metropolis updates based on ratios of closed-form integrated likelihoods and provides evidence-based complexity control that discourages gratuitous over-partitioning. We derive exact collapsed marginals for the most common SBM edge types-Beta-Bernoulli (binary), Gamma-Poisson (counts), and Normal-Inverse-Gamma (Gaussian weights)-and we extend collapsing to gap-constrained SBMs via truncated conjugate priors that enforce explicit upper bounds on between-community connectivity. We further show that the same collapsed strategy supports directed SBMs that model reciprocity through dyad states, signed SBMs via categorical block models, and multiplex SBMs where multiple layers contribute additive evidence for a shared partition. Across synthetic benchmarks and real networks (including email communication, hospital contact counts, and citation graphs), collapsed inference produces accurate partitions and interpretable posterior block summaries of within- and between-community interaction strengths while remaining computationally simple and modular.",

We study local decision-theoretic robustness by allowing the posterior to vary within a small Kullback-Leibler neighborhood and choosing actions that minimize worst-case posterior expected loss. Exploiting low-dimensional functionals available under exchangeability, we (i) adapt decision-theoretic robustness to exchangeable graphs via graphon limits and derive sharp small-radius expansions of robust posterior risk; under squared loss the leading inflation is controlled by the posterior variance of the loss, and for robustness indices that diverge at percolation/fragmentation thresholds we obtain a universal critical exponent describing the explosion of decision uncertainty near criticality. (ii) Develop a nonparametric minimax theory for robust model selection between sparse Erdos-Renyi and block models, showing-via robustness error exponents-that no Bayesian or frequentist method can uniformly improve upon the decision-theoretic limits over configuration models and sparse graphon classes for percolation-type functionals.

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly through large neural networks trained on massive datasets using thousands of GPUs or TPUs. Such training can occupy entire data centers for weeks and requires enormous computational and energy resources. Yet the optimization algorithms behind these runs have not kept pace. Most large scale training still relies on synchronous methods, where workers must wait for the slowest device, wasting compute and amplifying the effects of hardware and network variability. Removing synchronization seems like a simple fix, but asynchrony introduces staleness, meaning updates computed on outdated models. This makes analysis difficult, especially when delays arise from system level randomness rather than algorithmic choices. As a result, the time complexity of asynchronous methods remains poorly understood. This dissertation develops a rigorous framework for asynchronous first order stochastic optimization, focusing on the core challenge of heterogeneous worker speeds. Within this framework, we show that with proper design, asynchronous SGD can achieve optimal time complexity, matching guarantees previously known only for synchronous methods. Our first contribution, Ringmaster ASGD, attains optimal time complexity in the homogeneous data setting by selectively discarding stale updates. The second, Ringleader ASGD, extends optimality to heterogeneous data, common in federated learning, using a structured gradient table mechanism. Finally, ATA improves resource efficiency by learning worker compute time distributions and allocating tasks adaptively, achieving near optimal wall clock time with less computation. Together, these results establish asynchronous optimization as a theoretically sound and practically efficient foundation for distributed learning, showing that coordination without synchronization can be both feasible and optimal.",

These two goals achieved in this article are two of the crucial ingredients used in our collaboration with Hamman, Ivanov, Louren\u00e7o and Zou to construct the equivalence that compares the schematic and analytic local Langlands categories of Zhu and of Fargues--Scholze. To achieve these goals, we introduce and study spatial kimberlites, which is a better behaved variant of the theory previously developed by the author.",

    "abstract": "We derive and analyze well-posed, energy- and entropy-stable boundary conditions (BCs) for the two-dimensional linear and nonlinear rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) in vector invariant form. The focus of the study is on subcritical flows, which are commonly observed in atmospheric, oceanic, and geostrophic flow applications. We consider spatial domains with smooth boundaries and formulate both linear and nonlinear BCs using mass flux, Riemann's invariants, and Bernoulli's potential, ensuring that the resulting initial boundary value problem (IBVP) is provably entropy- and energy-stable. The linear analysis is comprehensive, providing sufficient conditions to establish the existence, uniqueness, and energy stability of solutions to the linear IBVP. For the nonlinear IBVP, which admits more general solutions, our goal is to develop nonlinear BCs that guarantee entropy stability. We introduce the concepts of linear consistency and linear stability for nonlinear IBVPs, demonstrating that if a nonlinear IBVP is both linearly consistent and linearly stable, then, for sufficiently regular initial and boundary data over a finite time interval, a unique smooth solution exists. Both the linear and nonlinear IBVPs can be efficiently solved using high-order accurate numerical methods. By employing high-order summation-by-parts operators to discretize spatial derivatives and implementing weak enforcement of BCs via penalty techniques, we develop provably energy- and entropy-stable numerical schemes on curvilinear meshes. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to verify the accuracy of the methods and to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed BCs and numerical schemes.",

After adopting a novel electrical network interpretation involving nonlinear capacitors, it is shown that Hopfield networks admit a port-Hamiltonian formulation provided an extra passivity condition is satisfied. Subsequently it is shown that any Hopfield network can be represented as a gradient system, with Riemannian metric given by the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the total energy stored in the nonlinear capacitors. On the other hand, the well-known 'energy' function employed by Hopfield turns out to be the dissipation potential of the gradient system, and this potential is shown to satisfy a dissipation inequality that can be used for analysis and interconnection.",

We develop a complete symbolic and Volterra theory, including explicit Prabhakar-type kernels, a left-inverse Volterra integral, and a fractional fundamental theorem of calculus. We show that the natural factorization of the Laplace symbol does not fit the classical Bernstein product mechanism and that the symbol is not a Bernstein function in general. Despite this non-Bernstein character, we establish well-posedness of abstract fractional Cauchy problems with sectorial generators by resolvent estimates and Laplace inversion, yielding a W-resolvent family with temporal regularity and smoothing properties. As an illustration, we apply the theory to a W-fractional diffusion model and discuss the influence of the modulation parameter on the relaxation of spectral modes.",

This work generalizes the earlier results of Kamiya, Takemura and Terao, as well as Chen and Wang.\n  The purpose of this paper is threefold as follows.

The modifications overcome the challenging problems of rank deficiency when applying the UKF to parameter estimation. Rank deficiency usually means only a small subset of parameters can be estimated. Traditionally, pragmatic compromises are made, such as selecting an optimal subset of parameters for estimation and fixing non-influential parameters. Kalman filters are typically used for dynamical state tracking, to facilitate the control u at every time step. However, for the purpose of parameter estimation, this constraint no longer applies. Our modification has transformed the utility of UKF for the parameter estimation purpose, including minimally influential parameters, with excellent robustness (i.e., under severe noise corruption, challenging patho-physiology, and no prior knowledge of parameter distributions). The modified UKF algorithm is robust in recovering almost all parameters to over 98% accuracy, over 90% of the time, with a challenging target data set of 50, 10-parameter samples. We compare this to the original implementation of the UKF algorithm for parameter estimation and demonstrate a significant improvement.",

These tensors satisfy the first Bianchi identity and obey a hereditary contraction relation interpolating between the double dual tensor and the Einstein tensor.\n  We prove that, in a generic geometric setting, each tensor in this hierarchy is the unique divergence--free $(p,p)$ double form depending linearly on the Riemann curvature tensor, thereby providing canonical higher--rank parents of the Einstein tensor.\n  Their sectional curvatures coincide with the $p$--curvatures; notably, the $2$--curvature determines the full Riemann curvature tensor and forces the $\\hat A$--genus of a compact spin manifold to vanish when nonnegative, a property not shared by Ricci or scalar curvature. Finally, we extend the construction to Gauss--Kronecker curvature tensors and Lovelock theory, showing in particular that the second Lovelock tensor $T_4$ admits a genuine four--index parent tensor.",

    "abstract": "Let $M$ and $N$ be two closed hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. The Ehrenpreis Conjecture (proved by Kahn-Markovic) asserts that for any $\u03b5>0$ there are finite covers $M_\u03b5\\to M$, and $N_\u03b5\\to N$, such that the Teichmuller distance (in the suitable moduli space) between $M_\u03b5$ and $N_\u03b5$ is less than $\u03b5$. It is natural to ask how large the degrees of these coverings need to be to achieve that the distance between $M_\u03b5$ and $N_\u03b5$ is less than $\u03b5$. In this paper we show that there exists a constant $k>0$, depending only on $M$ and $N$, so that the covers $M_\u03b5\\to M$, and $N_\u03b5\\to N$, can be chosen to have the degrees less than $\u03b5^{-k}$. We show that this bound is optimal by considering the case when $M$ and $N$ are arithmetic Riemann surfaces with the same invariant trace field which are not commensurable to each other.",

    "abstract": "Recently, Atar and Miyazawa [2] introduced a multi-level GI/G/1 queue with a finite number of levels, where both the arrival and service rates depend on the level corresponding to the current queue length. For this model, they proved that the diffusion limit of its queue length process in heavy traffic is the level-dependent reflected Brownian motion of [6]. In a subsequent study, Kobayashi et al. [4] derived the corresponding diffusion limit of the stationary distribution. These studies are motivated by the control of service capacity depending on the queue length. We are interested in the more general case where this control may also depend on the history of the queue length. As the first step toward such a generalization, we specialize the multi-level GI/G/1 queue to a two-level M/M/1 queue. We then extend the dynamics of this model so that its arrival and service rates depend not only on the current queue length but also on the recent history of queue lengths. Under the stability condition for this model, we first compute its stationary distribution in closed form, then derive its diffusion limit in heavy traffic. Finally, using this diffusion limit, we derive approximation formulas for the stationary distribution and then numerically assess their accuracy.",

We present an extended version of the homotopy theorem, in which we give a more refined classification of the different types of elementary cycles. We explain in detail how the path theorem allows one to prove that the foundation of a matroid (in the sense of Baker--Lorscheid) is generated by universal cross-ratios, and how the extended homotopy theorem allows one to classify all algebraic relations between universal cross-ratios. The resulting ''fundamental presentation'' of the foundation was previously established in [Baker--Lorscheid], but the argument here is more self-contained. We then recall a few applications of the fundamental presentation to the representation theory of matroids. Finally, in the most novel but also the most speculative part of the paper, we discuss what a ''higher Tutte homotopy theorem'' might look like, and we present some preliminary computations along these lines.",

Working in a weighted Sobolev space that combines the homogeneous Sobolev space with a weighted Lebesgue term, we establish continuous and compact embeddings of Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg type. These embeddings, together with a model that displays a natural scaling, allow us to apply the abstract critical point framework of Mercuri and Perera (2025), yielding a sequence of nonlinear eigenvalues for the associated problem. This scaling property leads to a classification of weighted power-type nonlinearities into subscaled, scaled, and superscaled regimes. Within this variational setting, we obtain broad existence and multiplicity results for equations driven by sums of weighted power nonlinearities, covering superscaled, scaled, and subscaled interactions, both in the subcritical and critical cases. We also provide a nonexistence result as a consequence of a Pohozaev-type identity. Finally, in the radial setting we employ improved radial CKN inequalities to enlarge the admissible embedding ranges. This yields strengthened radial versions of all our main results, including two-dimensional configurations with more singular weights, where no compact embeddings are available in the nonradial case.",

    "abstract": "Variance reduction (VR) is a crucial tool for solving finite-sum optimization problems, including the composite general convex setting, which is the focus of this work. On the one hand, denoting the number of component functions as $n$ and the target accuracy as $\u03b5$, some VR methods achieve the near-optimal complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(n+\\sqrt{n}/\\sqrt\u03b5\\right)$, but they all have nested structure and fail to provide convergence guarantee for the iterate sequence itself. On the other hand, single-loop VR methods, being free from the aforementioned disadvantages, have complexity no better than $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n+n/\\sqrt\u03b5\\right)$ which is the complexity of the deterministic method FISTA, thus leaving a critical gap unaddressed. In this work, we propose the \\textit{Harmonia} technique which relates checkpoint update probabilities to momentum parameters in single-loop VR methods. Based on this technique, we further propose to vary the growth rate of the momentum parameter, creating a novel continuous trade-off between acceleration and variance reduction, controlled by the key parameter $\u03b1\\in[0,1]$. The proposed techniques lead to following favourable consequences. First, several known complexity of quite different algorithms are re-discovered under the proposed unifying algorithmic framework Katyusha-H. Second, under an extra mild condition, Katyusha-H achieves the near-optimal complexity for $\u03b1$ belonging to a certain interval, highlighting the effectiveness of the acceleration-variance reduction trade-off. Last, without extra conditions, Katyusha-H achieves the complexity $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n+\\sqrt{n}/\\sqrt\u03b5)$ with $\u03b1=1$ and proper mini-batch sizes.

The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm.",

We then show that the data-driven approach for designing an output-feedback control law for the given plant can be reduced to the data-driven design of a state-feedback control law for a well-defined augmented auxiliary system.

The existing theory for HFHR dynamics in the literature is restricted to strongly-convex $U$, although numerical experiments are promising for non-convex settings as well. We focus on studying the convergence of HFHR dynamics when $U$ can be non-convex, which bridges a gap between theory and practice. Under a standard assumption of dissipativity and smoothness on $U$, we adopt the reflection/synchronous coupling method. This yields a Lyapunov-weighted Wasserstein distance in which the HFHR semigroup is exponentially contractive for all sufficiently small $\u03b1>0$ whenever KLD is. We further show that, under an additional assumption that asymptotically $\\nabla U$ has linear growth at infinity, the contraction rate for HFHR dynamics is strictly better than that of KLD, with an explicit gain. As a case study, we verify the assumptions and the resulting acceleration for three examples: a multi-well potential, Bayesian linear regression with $L^p$ regularizer and Bayesian binary classification. We conduct numerical experiments based on these examples, as well as an additional example of Bayesian logistic regression with real data processed by the neural networks, which illustrates the efficiency of the algorithms based on HFHR dynamics and verifies the acceleration and superior performance compared to KLD.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel dispersive regularization framework for the numerical simulation of the one-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE). The classical hyperbolic system is regularized by a third-order dispersive term in the momentum equation, which renders the system equivalent, via the Madelung transform, to a defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a drift term induced by bottom topography.\n  Instead of solving the shallow water equations directly, we solve the associated Schr\u00f6dinger equation and recover the hydrodynamic variables through a simple postprocessing procedure. This approach transforms the original nonlinear hyperbolic system into a semilinear complex-valued equation, which can be efficiently approximated using a Strang time-splitting method combined with a spectral element discretization in space.\n  Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in subcritical regimes without shock formation, the Schr\u00f6dinger regularization provides an $O(\\varepsilon)$ approximation to the classical shallow water solution, where $\\varepsilon$ denotes the regularization parameter. Importantly, we observe that this convergence behavior persists even in the presence of moving wetting--drying interfaces, where vacuum states emerge and standard shallow water solvers often encounter difficulties. These results suggest that the Schr\u00f6dinger-based formulation offers a robust and promising alternative framework for the numerical simulation of shallow water flows with dry states.",

We provide analytical proofs of these conservation properties and also verify them numerically. While the framework is general, our implementation focuses on second-order finite-difference SBP operators. The methods are implemented in Julia for CPU and GPU architectures (AMD and NVIDIA) and achieve substantial speedups on modern accelerators.

    "abstract": "Linear queries, as the basis of broad analysis tasks, are often released through privacy mechanisms based on differential privacy (DP), the most popular framework for privacy protection. However, DP adopts a context-free definition that operates independently of the data-generating distribution. In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees.",

    "abstract": "In combinatorial optimization, ordinal costs can be used to model the quality of elements whenever numerical values are not available. When considering, for example, routing problems for cyclists, the safety of a street can be ranked in ordered categories like safe (separate bike lane), medium safe (street with a bike lane) and unsafe (street without a bike lane). However, ordinal optimization may suggest unrealistic solutions with huge detours to avoid unsafe street segments. In this paper, we investigate how partial preference information regarding the relative quality of the ordinal categories can be used to improve the relevance of the computed solutions. By introducing preference weights which describe how much better a category is at least or at most, compared to the subsequent category, we enlarge the ordinal dominance cone. This leads to a smaller set of alternatives, i. e., of ordinally efficient solutions. We show that the corresponding weighted ordinal ordering cone is a polyhedral cone and provide descriptions via its extreme rays and via its facets. The latter implies a linear transformation to an associated multi-objective optimization problem. This paves the way for the application of standard multi-objective solution approaches. We demonstrate the usefulness of the weighted ordinal ordering cone by investigating a safest path problem with different preference weights. Moreover, we investigate the interrelation between the weighted ordering cone to standard dominance concepts of multi-objective optimization, like, e.g., Pareto dominance, lexicographic dominance and weighted sum dominance.",

We observe that this bundle embeds as an $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$-orbit closure in the moduli space of once marked translation surfaces, and hence we may invoke the spectral gap results of Avila and Gou\u00ebzel and a quantitative mean ergodic theorem for the $SL_2(\\mathbb{R})$-action on the mean-zero, square-integrable functions on $Y$.",

    "abstract": "We study a hybrid computational model for integer factorization in which the only non-classical resource is access to an \\emph{iterated diffusion process} on a finite graph. Concretely, a \\emph{diffusion step} is defined to be one application of a symmetric stochastic matrix (the half-lazy walk operator) to an $\\ell^{1}$--normalized state vector, followed by an optional readout of selected coordinates.\n  Let $N\\ge 3$ be an odd integer which is neither prime nor a prime power, and let $b\\in(\\mathbb{Z}/N\\mathbb{Z})^\\ast$ have odd multiplicative order $r={\\rm ord}_N(b)$. We construct, without knowing $r$ in advance, a weighted Cayley graph whose vertex set is the cyclic subgroup $\\langle b\\rangle$ and whose edges correspond to the powers $b^{\\pm 2^t}$ for $t\\le \\lfloor \\log_2 N\\rfloor+1$. Using an explicit spectral decomposition together with an elementary doubling lemma, we show that $r$ can be recovered from a single heat-kernel value after at most $O((\\log_2 N)^2)$ diffusion steps, with an effective bound.\n  We then combine this order-finding model with the standard reduction from factoring to order finding (in the spirit of Shor's framework) to obtain a randomized factorization procedure whose success probability depends only on the number $m$ of distinct prime factors of $N$. Our comparison with Shor's algorithm is \\emph{conceptual and model-based}. We replace unitary $\\ell^2$ evolution by Markovian $\\ell^1$ evolution, and we report complexity in two cost measures: digital steps and diffusion steps.

    "abstract": "We introduce and analyze a class of interacting particle systems on the real line that combine features of the stochastic rat race and (deterministic) follow-the-leader models. The particle system evolves as a continuous-time pure jump process: the leading particle moves independently, at Exponential jump times, with constant jump rate and iid jump sizes distributed according to a law $\u03b8$, while each of the remaining particles jumps forward, at Exponential times, at rate equal to its distance from the particle immediately ahead, with jump sizes drawn uniformly from the corresponding gap. The dynamics thus encode competition for leadership together with distance-dependent stochastic interactions. Our main focus is the associated gap process, representing the vector of inter-particle distances. We establish the existence of a unique stationary distribution for the gap process and prove uniform geometric ergodicity. Further, when the leader's jump sizes follow an Exponential distribution, we identify the stationary law explicitly as a product of independent Exponential laws, and show that the associated mixing time scales between $\u0398(n)$ and $O(n(\\log n)^2)$ for an $n$-particle system. As an application of the mixing time results we establish a functional limit theorem that characterizes fluctuations of particle states at large time, under a suitable spatial and temporal scaling and large particle limit. Finally, when the leader's jumps have heavy but integrable tails, we show that each gap has at least one additional finite moment under stationarity than that of the leader's jump size distribution. The model offers a tractable setting for exploring ergodicity, explicit invariant laws, and mixing behavior in non-diffusive particle systems.",

By employing the Chinese Remainder Theorem and Hensel's lifting technique, we derive an exact counting formula for the number of these exceptional units on a smooth closed subscheme under the assumption of good reduction. Furthermore, using the Lang-Weil inequality, we establish an asymptotic estimate for the counting function. In particular, we prove that for varieties of degree at most two, the error term can be significantly improved, yielding a sharper asymptotic bound.",

Hydraulically amplified electrostatic (HASEL) actuators, a class of soft artificial muscles, offer high performance but exhibit memory effects and hysteresis. Here we present a data-driven reduction and control strategy grounded in spectral submanifold (SSM) theory. In the adiabatic regime, where inputs vary slowly relative to intrinsic transients, trajectories rapidly converge to a low-dimensional slow manifold. We learn an explicit input-to-output map on this manifold from forced-response trajectories alone, avoiding decay experiments that can trigger hysteresis. We deploy the SSM-based model for real-time control of an antagonistic HASEL-clutch joint. This approach yields a substantial reduction in tracking error compared to feedback-only and feedforward-only baselines under identical settings. This record-and-control workflow enables rapid characterization and high-performance control of soft muscles and muscle-driven joints without detailed physics-based modeling.",

Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\\mathbf{F}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\\mathbf{G}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K) = (\\mathbf{1}(1 \\in \\mathcal{I}),\\ldots,\\mathbf{1}(K\\in \\mathcal{I}))$, where $\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \\textit{rank-increment condition}: $\\mathrm{rank}\\left(\\bigl[\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}};\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr]\\right) =\\mathrm{rank}\\bigl(\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr)+N$.

We verify their conjecture in the case of the two-point spectral density for a quantum particle in a three-dimensional box, subject to a Diophantine condition on the domain's proportions. A permissible choice of width, height and depth is for example $1,2^{1/3},2^{-1/3}$. This extends previous work of Eskin, Margulis and Mozes (Annals of Math., 2005) in dimension two, where the problem reduces to the quantitative Oppenheim conjecture for quadratic forms of signature $(2,2)$. The difficulty in three and higher dimensions is that we need to consider the distribution of indefinite forms in shrinking rather than fixed intervals, which we are able to resolve for special diagonal forms of signature $(3,3)$ in various scalings, including a rate of convergence. A key step of our approach is to represent the relevant counting problem as an average of a theta function on $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})^3\\backslash\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{R})^3$ over an expanding family of one-parameter unipotent orbits. The asymptotic behaviour of these unipotent averages follows from Ratner's measure classification theorem and subtle escape of mass estimates.",

    "title": "Subjective-Objective Median-based Importance Technique (SOMIT) to Aid Multi-Criteria Renewable Energy Evaluation",
    "abstract": "Accelerating the renewable energy transition requires informed decision-making that accounts for the diverse financial, technical, environmental, and social trade-offs across different renewable energy technologies. A critical step in this multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process is the determination of appropriate criteria weights. However, deriving these weights often solely involves either subjective assessment from decision-makers or objective weighting methods, each of which has limitations in terms of cognitive burden, potential bias, and insufficient contextual relevance. This study proposes the subjective-objective median-based importance technique (SOMIT), a novel hybrid approach for determining criteria weights in MCDM. By tailoring SOMIT to renewable energy evaluation, the method directly supports applied energy system planning, policy analysis, and technology prioritization under carbon neutrality goals. The practical utility of SOMIT is demonstrated through two MCDM case studies on renewable energy decision-making in India and Saudi Arabia. Using the derived weights from SOMIT, the TOPSIS method ranks the renewable energy alternatives, with solar power achieving the highest performance scores in both cases. The main contributions of this work are five-fold: 1) the proposed SOMIT reduces the number of required subjective comparisons from the conventional quadratic order to a linear order; 2) SOMIT is more robust to outliers in the alternatives-criteria matrix (ACM); 3) SOMIT balances subjective expert knowledge with objective data-driven insights, thereby mitigating bias; 4) SOMIT is inherently modular, allowing both its individual parts and the complete approach to be seamlessly coupled with a wide range of MCDM methods commonly applied in energy systems and policy analysis; 5) a dedicated Python library, pysomit, is developed for SOMIT.",

This answers questions raised by Albiac, Ansorena, C\u00fath and Doucha and Candido, C\u00fath and Doucha, respectively, and extends previous results by the same authors as well as H\u00e1jek and Novotn\u00fd.",

This characteristic polynomial arises from a recurrence relation that enumerates $n \\times n$ nonnegative integer matrices with all row and column sums equal to $t$, also called the Ehrhart polynomial of the $n$th Birkhoff polytope. The proof relies on an unexpected observation: shifting $C$ by a scalar multiple of the identity matrix yields a matrix similar to a lower triangular matrix. In triangular form, the characteristic polynomial reduces to the product of the diagonal entries, leading to the desired closed-form expression. Moreover, we extend this method to broader families of tridiagonal matrices. This provides a new approach for deriving exact enumeration formulas.",

No algebraic structures are imposed on these collections. This setting allows us to uncover a close relationship between scissors congruence problems on the one hand and finite hyperplane arrangements on the other hand: there are many parallel results in these fields, for which the parallelism seems to have gone unnoticed. In particular, certain properties of the Varchenko--Gelfand algebras for arrangements translate to properties of polytope rings or valuations. Studying these properties is possible in a general topological setting, that is, in the context of the so-called topological arrangements, where hyperplanes do not have to be straight and may even have nontrivial topology.",

We consider first a weak space-time formulation with test functions projected onto discontinuous polynomials of one degree lower in time, showing that it is equivalent to the scheme proposed in [French, Peterson 1996] in the linear case, and extended in [Karakashian, Makridakis 2005] to the semilinear case. In particular, this equivalence shows that this method conserves energy at mesh nodes but is not symplectic. We then introduce two symplectic variants, obtained through Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto quadratures in time, and show that they correspond to specific Runge-Kutta time integrators.

    "abstract": "We study the homogeneous Landau equation with Maxwell molecules and prove that the entropy production is non-increasing provided the directional temperatures are well-distributed and the solution admits a moment of order $\\ell$, for some $\\ell$ arbitrarily close to $2$. It implies that for an initial condition with finite moment of order $\\ell$, the entropy production is guaranteed to be non-increasing after a certain time, that we explicitly compute. This is the first partial answer to a conjecture made by Henry P. McKean in 1966 on the sign of the time-derivatives of the entropy. We also obtain algebraic decay estimates for the entropy production for large time; as well as a short-time estimate without moment assumptions.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with the interactions of waves governed by a non-linear dispersive Boussinesq type system with the vertical displacement of a cylindrical floating structure in an axisymmetric without swirl situation. The Boussinesq regime is a good approximation of free surface Euler's equations when the non-linear parameter and the shallowness parameter are small. The vertical motion of the floating body is governed by the Newton equation. The full coupled wave-structure interaction problem under consideration is reduced to a boundary problem. The boundary condition satisfied by the discharge is given in terms of the vertical displacement of the floating cylinder. The latter is calculated using an ODE, which requires knowledge of the trace of the surface elevation and its second-time derivative. We use the dispersion in order to exhibit a hidden second order ODE on the trace of the surface elevation. This finally allows us to rewrite the waves-structure interaction problem as a system of non-local conservative PDEs plus bounded radial terms with a dispersive boundary layer, combined with an ODE at the boundary. This is what we call the Augmented formulation. Afterwards we showed that this formulation is well-posed with two different methods. Finally, we study the return to equilibrium situation in the linear regime. In particular, we improved previous results on the explicit time decay. We showed that the center mass of the floating body cannot converge to its equilibrium faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1/2})$ in 2D without viscosity and faster than $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-3/2})$ with viscosity.",

    "abstract": "We propose a Pretrained Finite Element Method (PFEM),a physics driven framework that bridges the efficiency of neural operator learning with the accuracy and robustness of classical finite element methods (FEM). PFEM consists of a physics informed pretraining stage and an optional finetuning stage. In the pretraining stage, a neural operator based on the Transolver architecture is trained solely from governing partial differential equations, without relying on labeled solution data. The model operates directly on unstructured point clouds, jointly encoding geometric information, material properties, and boundary conditions, and produces physically consistent initial solutions with extremely high computational efficiency. PDE constraints are enforced through explicit finite element, based differentiation, avoiding the overhead associated with automatic differentiation. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained prediction is used as an initial guess for conventional FEM solvers, preserving their accuracy, convergence guarantees, and extrapolation capability while substantially reducing the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed tolerance. PFEM is validated on a broad range of benchmark problems, including linear elasticity and nonlinear hyperelasticity with complex geometries, heterogeneous materials, and arbitrary boundary conditions. Numerical results demonstrate strong generalization in the pretraining stage with relative errors on the order of 1\\%, and speedups of up to one order of magnitude in the fine-tuning stage compared to FEM with zero initial guesses.",

For a measurable map $f:\u03a9\\to Y$ and input law $\u03bc$, we define a law-induced kernel on $Y$ whose pullback minimally dominates $K$, and show that it yields a coarse-graining inequality and a data-processing inequality for $H_K$, for both deterministic maps and general Markov kernels.

On the classical side, we consider bi-Hamiltonian systems defined by a Poisson pencil with non-trivial invariants. Using an exact symplectic realization, these invariants are lifted and projected onto a contact manifold, yielding a completely integrable contact Hamiltonian system in terms of dissipated quantities and a Jacobi-commutative algebra of observables. On the quantum side, we introduce a class of contact-compatible Lindblad generators: GKSL evolutions whose dissipative part preserves a commutative $C^\\ast$-subalgebra generated by the quantizations of the classical dissipated quantities, and whose Hamiltonian part admits an Egorov-type semiclassical limit to the contact dynamics. This construction provides a mathematical mechanism compatible with the semiclassical limit for pure dephasing, compatible with integrability and contact dissipation. An explicit Euler-top-type Poisson-Lie pencil, inspired by deformed Euler top models, is developed as a fully worked-out example illustrating the resulting bi-Lindblad structure and its semiclassical behavior.",
