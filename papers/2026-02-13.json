We propose two GenAI based approaches, generative conditional diffusion model (GCDM) and generative conditional diffusion implicit model (GCDIM), leveraging the diffusion model conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. To benchmark performance, we compare the proposed GenAI based approaches against an expert algorithm, traditionally known for achieving near-optimal solutions at the cost of computational efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate that GCDM matches the sum SE achieved by the expert algorithm while significantly reducing the computational overhead. Furthermore, GCDIM achieves a comparable sum SE with an additional $98\\%$ reduction in computation time, underscoring its potential for efficient phase optimization in RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems.",

However, EV adoption in cold regions is hindered by degraded battery performance at low temperatures, which necessitates effective battery thermal management. Hence, this work proposes a novel online EV charging control strategy, incorporating battery thermal management for cold environments. We first build queue models for both battery charging and thermal dynamics. Then, we formulate an optimization problem, which allows us to coordinate battery charging and heating through maintaining queue stability. To solve the problem, we develop an online control algorithm within the theoretical framework of Lyapunov optimization. Note that our online method is prediction-free and independent of any assumed modeling of uncertainty. We also characterize both the feasibility and optimality of the proposed control approach. Numerical results based on real-world data corroborate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our control method through comparisons.",

For a fixed sender network, we establish component-wise finite-time flocking results under both integrable and non-integrable communication weights. When communication weight function is non-integrable, finite-time flocking is guaranteed for any bounded initial configuration. We further extend the flocking analysis to switching sender networks and show that finite-time flocking persists under mild assumptions on the cumulative influence of time-varying sender weights.

First, we propose a model called $\u03b4$-CBO}, which incorporates nonvanishing diffusion to prevent premature collapse to suboptimal states. We also develop a numerically stable implementation, the Consensus Freezing scheme, that remains robust even for arbitrarily large time steps by freezing the consensus point over time intervals. We connect these models through appropriate asymptotic limits. Furthermore, we derive from the Consensus Freezing scheme by suitable time rescaling and asymptotics a further algorithm, the Consensus Hopping scheme, which can be interpreted as a form of $(1,\u03bb)$-Evolution Strategy.

The currently best bounds assert that $n\\ln n-O(n)\\le s(n) \\le C n\\ln n+O(n)$, where $C = \\frac{14}{5\\ln 2} \\approx 4.04$. Here, we improve the upper bound to $c n\\ln n + O(n)$, where $c = \\frac{19}{6\\ln 3} \\approx 2.88$. We develop in the proof a strategy that, broadly speaking, is based on separating trees into three parts, thus enabling us to embed them in a structure that originates from ternary trees.\n  Our method also applies to graphs that are close to being trees, measured by their treewidth. Let $s_w(n)$ be the minimum number of edges in a $n$-vertex graph that is universal for graphs with treewidth $w$. By performing a graph blow-up to our universal structure and counting necessary edges carefully, we establish that $nw \\ln(n/w) -O(nw) \\leq s_w(n) \\leq \\frac{19}{6\\ln3} n (w+1) \\ln(n/w) + O(nw)$.",

    "abstract": "The newsvendor model is a well-known stochastic model for inventory management; however, it was originally developed for a single-period context and focuses on trading companies. This paper proposes an extension of the newsvendor model into a mutli-period setting, aiming to develop a decision-making tool for manufacturing firms to determine the optimal production batch size. The objective function is to maximize operating profit in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The model can also incorporate overhead costs, such as warehousing, shrinkage, cost of capital, and lead time between the production decision and output. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed model results in higher profitability compared to other newsvendor models used in our analysis, as well as the safety stock buffer approach. The key feature explaining its outperformance is better adaptability of the production batch size, that leads to fewer stock-outs relative to other newsvendor models and lower inventory levels compared to the safety stock buffer approach. The robustness analysis shows that the proposed model is quite tolerant of mismatches between the \"model\" and the \"true\" demand distributions. Finally, we provide some recommendations on selecting the appropriate \"model\" distribution for different SKUs.",

Based on this equivalence and in combination with the algorithm $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}$-inv, large-scale tests and scalability analysis of the Tikhonov-regularized model are conducted.\n  As a by-product of the analysis, some relevant and straightforward properties of the quaternion $z$-block circulant matrices are provided. As applications, a series of quaternion tensor decompositions under the QT-product and their corresponding $z$-block circulant matrices decompositions are obtained, including the QT-Polar decomposition, the QT-PLU decomposition, and the QT-LU decomposition. Meanwhile, the QT-SVD is rederived based on the relation between $\\mathcal A$ and $\\mathtt{bcirc_z}(\\mathcal A)$.

We formulate fractional-power analogues of the method's key hypotheses and prove they lead to strong convergence. We verify these analogues for free products of finite groups $\u0393=G_1*\\cdots*G_m$.

Remarkably, this is the same as the capacity of the channel in the NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting, $C^{NS,nc}=\\max_{P_{X|S}}I(X;Y\\mid S)$, which was previously established, and also matches the (either classical or with NS assistance) capacity of the channel where the state is available not only (either causally or non-causally) to the transmitter but also to the receiver. While the capacity remains unchanged, the optimal probability of error for fixed message size and blocklength, in the NS-assisted causal CSIT setting can be further improved if channel state is made available to the receiver. This is in contrast to corresponding NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting where it was previously noted that the optimal probability of error cannot be further improved by providing the state to the receiver.",

Our target application is the computation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output transfer functions arising from large-scale discretizations of problems with continuous spectral measures, such as linear time-invariant PDEs on unbounded domains. Traditional Krylov methods, such as Lanczos or conjugate gradients, focus on resolving individual eigenvalues of a dense discretization, while ignoring the underlying continuous spectral measure that these points approximate. We argue that it is more efficient to model the inherent branch cut of the original operator than to exhaustively resolve the artificial point spectrum induced by discretization. We place this problem in a framework, known in the physics literature as the square-root terminator. To overcome its limitations, we formulate a quadratic terminator using Kre\u012dn--Nudelman semi-infinite strings, with parameters chosen adaptively to maximize relative energy outflow.\n  This approach results in a low-rank modification to the (block) Lanczos matrix, dependent on $\\sqrt{s}$, with an additional $O(n)$ cost. We demonstrate significant error reductions for large-scale self-adjoint PDE discretizations in unbounded domains, including two- and three-dimensional Maxwell's equations in diffusive regimes. The method proves particularly advantageous in computing state-space solutions for wave propagation, specifically for 2D wave and 3D Maxwell's operators. Implicitly replacing the conventional Lanczos spectral decomposition with a representation in terms of the continuous Kre\u012dn--Nudelman spectrum, we obtain a qualitative improvement in finite-difference approximations, effectively transforming standing-wave artifacts into outgoing propagating waves.",

In this setting, several features of quantum field theory, such as Lorentz symmetry and modular localization, emerge automatically. In the case of a particle described by a massive positive energy representation of the Poincar\u00e9 group, the Brunetti-Guido-Longo map defines a spacetime localization observable that is unique under some natural further assumptions. Regarding possible probabilistic interpretations of such a structure, a Gleason theorem and a cluster theorem for symplectic complements are established. These imply that evaluating such localization observables in states yields a fuzzy probability measure that fails to be a measure because it is not additive. However, for separation scales that are large in comparison to the Compton wavelength, the emerging modular localization picture is essentially additive and approximates the one of Newton-Wigner.",

    "abstract": "In response to climate change, the International Maritime Organization has introduced regulatory frameworks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping. Compliance with these regulations is increasingly expected from individual shipping companies, compelling vessel operators to lower the CO2 emissions of their fleets while maintaining economic viability. An important step towards achieving this is performing regular hull and propeller cleaning; however, this entails significant costs. As a result, assessing whether ship performance has declined sufficiently to warrant cleaning from an environmental and economic standpoint is a critical task to ensure both long-term viability and regulatory compliance. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel data-driven dynamic programming approach to optimize vessel cleaning schedules by balancing both environmental and economic considerations. In numerical experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed methodology based on real-world sensor data from ten tramp trading vessels. The results confirm that over a four-year period, fuel consumption can be reduced by up to 5%, even when accounting for the costs of one or two additional cleaning events.",

Motivated by computational considerations, prior work has considered entropic relaxation of VQR, but its fundamental structural and approximation properties are still much less understood than entropic OT. The goal of this paper is to address some of these gaps. First, we study duality theory for entropic VQR and establish strong duality and dual attainment for marginals with possibly unbounded supports. In addition, when all marginals are compactly supported, we show that dual potentials are real analytic. Second, building on our duality theory, when all marginals are Gaussian, we show that entropic VQR has a closed-form optimal solution, which is again Gaussian, and establish the precise approximation rate toward unregularized VQR.",

Formally, we prove that the Block-Stacking Problem is NP-hard, partially answering an open question from the literature. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the restriction to stacks without counterweights has a surprising connection to the Airplane Refueling Problem, another famous puzzle, and to Robust Appointment Scheduling, a problem of practical relevance. In addition to revealing a remarkable relation to the real-world challenge of devising schedules under uncertainty, their equivalence unveils a polynomial-time approximation scheme, that is, a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximation algorithm, for Block Stacking without counterbalancing and a $(2+\u03b5)$-approximation algorithm for the general case.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a distributed flexible coupler (FC) array to enhance communication performance with low hardware cost. At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy.",

These measures are based on the Wasserstein distance and enable a model-free evaluation of the information value of the design before deciding the next query.

However, the erosion of the equator-to-pole temperature contrast due to polar amplification suggests that thermal forcing should be treated as a dynamic control parameter. In this study, we use Cessi's reduced box model to map the global bifurcation structure of the thermohaline circulation. We relax the assumption of a fixed thermal background and analyze the system's behavior under joint thermal and haline forcing. We prove the existence of a cusp bifurcation, identifying the specific geometry of pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations that bound the stable regime. This geometric characterization reveals that thermal erosion acts as a distinct mechanism for destabilization, capable of driving the system across critical thresholds even in the absence of anomalous freshwater forcing.",

For each parameter value, this representation yields an inner minimizer that can be interpreted as an approximate solution to a shifted scalarization of the original MOO problem. Under mild assumptions, the resulting family of solutions maps to a dense subset of the weak Pareto front. Finally, we propose a primal-dual algorithm based on this approach for solving the corresponding optimality system.

The proposed framework is evaluated on large-scale systems from the literature, containing up to 10000 nodes, adapted to multiple scenarios based on parameters from the California test system (CATS). Compared with a non-trivial baseline algorithm that includes the integrated MIP and heuristics, the proposed PH-based framework consistently improved solution quality for the six systems considered (including CATS), achieving an average optimality gap reduction of 16.23% within a 2-hour time limit.",

By examining the positions of zero entries in eigenfunctions of the graph Laplacian operator, we establish a sharp upper bound on the number of noise-free edges that ensures both the strong Feller property and irreducibility. Interestingly, we find that the addition of noise to any single edge is sufficient for chain graphs, whereas for star graphs, at most one edge can remain noise-free without compromising the system's properties. Furthermore, under a dissipative condition, we prove the existence and exponential ergodicity of a unique invariant measure.",

    "abstract": "Maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) approaches are an effective framework for inverse problems with known forward operators, particularly when combined with expressive priors and careful parameter selection. In blind settings, however, their use becomes significantly less stable due to the inherent non-convexity of the problem and the potential non-identifiability of the solutions. (Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate empirically that the LMMSE solution can serve as an effective initialization for MAP approaches, improving their performance and reducing sensitivity to regularization parameters, thereby opening the door to future theoretical and practical developments.",

We provide a combinatorial proof of the sufficiency direction and extend Bernstein's theorem to positive characteristic. It follows that the wedge power matroid of $n$ generic points in dimension $n-2$ does not depend on the field characteristic.\n  Our proof method allows to identify many graphs that are independent in every $2$-rigidity family. In particular, we show this for all connected cubic graphs, with exceptions of $K_4$ and $K_{3,3}$. This gives a complete classification of cubic graphs in this respect and answers a question of Kalai in a strong form.\n  As a corollary, we obtain a new property of cubic graphs: every connected cubic graph except $K_4$ and $K_{3,3}$ has an orientation without directed and alternating cycles.

To facilitate CRB analysis applicable to activity indicators, we relax the binary activity states to continuous parameters, thereby aligning the bound-based evaluation with practical threshold-based detection decisions. Closed-form CRB expressions are derived for two representative detection formulations, namely covariance-oriented and coherent models. Moreover, for single-antenna FASs, we obtain a closed-form coherent CRB by leveraging random matrix theory. The results demonstrate that CRB-based analysis provides a tractable and informative benchmark for evaluating activity detection across architectures and detection schemes, and further reveal that FASs can deliver strong spatial-diversity gains with significantly reduced complexity.",

    "abstract": "This paper establishes a novel upper bound-termed the arithmetic Singleton bound-on the Hamming distance of any simple-root constacyclic code over a finite field. The key technical ingredient is the notion of multiple equal-difference (MED) representations of the defining set of a simple-root polynomial, which generalizes the MED representation of a cyclotomic coset. We prove that every MED representation induces an upper bound on the minimum distance; the classical Singleton bound corresponds to the coarsest representation, while the strongest among these bounds is defined as the arithmetic Singleton bound. It is shown that the arithmetic Singleton bound is always at least as tight as the Singleton bound, and a precise criterion for it to be strictly tighter is obtained. For irreducible constacyclic codes, the bound is given explicitly by $\u03c9+1$, where $\u03c9$ is a constant closely related to the order of $q$ modulo the radical of the polynomial order. This work provides the first systematic translation of arithmetic structure-via MED representations-into restrictive constraints on the minimum distance, revealing that the Singleton bound may be unattainable not because of linear limitations, but due to underlying algebraic obstructions.",

The probabilistic framework introduced in the first part of the book allows for a very general formulation of Fluctuation Relations and Theorems for both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. The authors further explore models of physical interest, illustrating this framework by concrete applications. The second part of the book focuses on chaotic dynamics. The formulation of two general Fluctuation Theorems, followed by the detailed study of a concrete example, provides the reader with an understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.",

Under suitable structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian and coupling terms, we establish discrete maximum principles and derive explicit error estimates that quantify both discretization errors and iteration errors within a unified framework.

This thesis presents two approaches for systematically constructing Lagrangian one-forms, which cover the case of finite-dimensional integrable hierarchies, thus addressing one of the central open problems in the theory of Lagrangian multiforms. The first approach, based on the theory of Lie dialgebras, incorporates into Lagrangian one-forms the notion of the classical $r$-matrix and produces Lagrangian one-forms living on coadjoint orbits. We prove an important structural result relating the closure relation for Lagrangian one-forms to the Poisson involutivity of Hamiltonians and the double zero on Euler-Lagrange equations. In the second approach, we extend the notion of Lagrangian one-forms to the setting of gauge theories and derive a variational formulation of the Hitchin system associated with a compact Riemann surface of arbitrary genus. We show that this description corresponds to a Lagrangian one-form for classical $3$d holomorphic-topological BF theory coupled with so-called type A and type B defects. Notably, this establishes an explicit connection between $3$d holomorphic-topological BF theory and the Hitchin system at the classical level. Further, we derive a unifying action for a hierarchy of Lax equations describing the Hitchin system in terms of meromorphic Lax matrices. As applications of the two approaches, we also obtain explicit Lagrangian one-forms for the hierarchies of various well-known integrable models.",

The obtained error estimators are used to conduct refinements of the computational mesh and as a stopping criterion for the dynamic iteration. In particular, we allow for an adaptive and flexible discretization of the time domain, where variables can be discretized differently to match both goal and solution requirements, e.g. in view of multiple time scales.

In this work, we model composite DNA storage as a multinomial channel and draw an analogy to digital modulation by representing composite letters on the three-dimensional probability simplex. To mitigate errors caused by sampling randomness, we derive transition probabilities and log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each constellation point and employ practical channel codes for error correction. We then extend this framework to substitution and insertion-deletion (ID) channels, proposing constellation update rules that account for these additional impairments. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach achieves reliable performance with existing LDPC codes, compared to the prior schemes designed for limited-magnitude probability errors, whose performance degrades significantly under sampling randomness.",

    "abstract": "The field of the mathematical sciences relies on a continuous academic pipeline in which individuals progress from undergraduate study through graduate training and postdoctoral program to long term faculty employment. National statistics report trends in bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree awards, but these data alone do not explain how individuals move through the academic system or how structural constraints shape downstream career outcomes. Persistent growth in postdoctoral appointments alongside relatively stable faculty employment indicates that degree production alone is insufficient to characterize workforce dynamics. In this study, we develop a discrete time compartmental model of the academic pipeline in the field of the mathematical sciences that links observed degree flows to latent population stocks. Undergraduate and graduate populations are reconstructed directly from nationally reported degree data, allowing postdoctoral and faculty dynamics to be examined under completion, exit, and hiring processes. Advancement to faculty positions is modeled as vacancy limited, with competition for permanent positions depending on downstream population size. Numerical simulations show that increases in degree inflow do not translate into proportional faculty growth when hiring is constrained by limited turnover. Instead, excess supply accumulates primarily at the postdoctoral stage, leading to sustained congestion and elevated competition. Sensitivity analyses indicate that long run workforce outcomes are governed mainly by faculty exit rates and hiring capacity rather than by degree production alone. These results demonstrate the central role of vacancy limited hiring in shaping academic career trajectories within the field of the mathematical sciences.",

This equation is known to be the two dimensional counterpart to the classical energy-critical Schr\u00f6dinger equations \\cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009}. The authors of \\cite{CollianderIbrahimMajdoubMasmoudi2009} also identified a trichotomy around the criticality of the equation based on the size of the total energy. In particular, for supercritical regimes (large energy), the equation is known to exhibit instabilities : the (uniform) continuity of the flow fails to hold. Large data distributional non unique probabilistic solutions have been obtained in \\cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024}. The setting of \\cite{CasterasMonsaingeon2024} does not handle the uniqueness issue for the $H^1$-data and therefore could not define a flow for this regularity. Our main focus here is to build a single probabilistic framework that provides both existence, uniqueness, and continuity with respect to the initial data in $H^1$. Our uniqueness and continuity are based on the so-called Yudowich argument \\cite{Judovic1963}, and the probabilistic estimates are derived through the IID limit procedure \\cite{Sy2019}. Beyond the difficulties related to the borderline nature of the context, the major challenge resides in the need to satisfy two features that tend to play against each other : obtaining both continuity property of the flow and large data in the support of the reference measure. This made the design of the dissipation operator inherent in the method, as well as the analysis of the resulting quantities, particularly difficult. Regarding the supercritical regime, we show that a modified energy, with regularity similar to the original total energy, admits values as high as desired, suggesting that the constructed set of data contains supercritical ones.",

A central open question is whether the observed persistence of such configurations can be attributed to intrinsic properties of the associated signed interaction networks, or whether it relies essentially on adaptive coupling dynamics. To address this question, we study the stability of antipodal and rotating-wave phase configurations on fixed signed networks that preserve the same phase symmetries but are not generated by adaptive dynamics. We show that for two canonical classes of static signed networks, stability is highly constrained, with unstable modes persisting under parameter variations generically, and we characterize how adaptive coupling influences invariant sets and basins of attraction for the configurations where stability is permitted. Taken together, these results show that while static network structure imposes severe constraints on the stability of phase-locked configurations, adaptive coupling dynamics organize and delineate their robustness when stability is permitted.",

Existing attempts at explaining its performance largely focus on single-step comparisons (on quadratic proxies) and worst-case guarantees that treat the inexactness of the polar-factor as a nuisance ``to be argued away''. We show that already on simple strongly convex functions such as $L(W)=\\frac12\\|W\\|_{\\text{F}}^2$, these perspectives are insufficient, suggesting that understanding Muon requires going beyond local proxies and pessimistic worst-case bounds. Instead, our analysis exposes two observations that already affect behavior on simple quadratics and are not well captured by prevailing abstractions: (i) approximation error in the polar step can qualitatively alter discrete-time dynamics and improve reachability and finite-time performance -- an effect practitioners exploit to tune Muon, but that existing theory largely treats as a pure accuracy compromise; and (ii) structural properties of the objective affect finite-budget constants beyond the prevailing conditioning-based explanations. Thus, any general theory covering these cases must either incorporate these ingredients explicitly or explain why they are irrelevant in the regimes of interest.",

    "abstract": "The timeliness of collected information is essential for monitoring and control in data-driven intelligent infrastructures. It is typically quantified using the Age of Information (AoI) metric, which has been widely adopted to capture the freshness of information received in the form of status updates. While AoI-based metrics quantify how timely the collected information is, they largely overlook the environmental impact associated with frequent transmissions, specifically, the resulting Carbon Footprint (CF). To address this gap, we introduce a carbon-aware AoI framework. We first derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI under constrained CF budgets for the baseline $M/M/1$ and $M/M/1^*$ queuing models, assuming fixed Carbon Intensity (CI). We then extend the analysis by treating CI as a dynamic, time-varying parameter and solve the AoI minimization problem. Our results show that minimizing AoI does not inherently minimize CF, highlighting a clear trade-off between information freshness and environmental impact. CI variability further affects achievable AoI, indicating that sustainable operation requires joint optimization of CF budgets, Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), and transmission scheduling. This work lays the foundation for carbon-aware information freshness optimization in next-generation networks.",

    "abstract": "We show that the iterative Faddeev-Jackiw (FJ) reduction for singular Lagrangian systems constitutes a geometrically constrained instance of the Matrix Bordering Technique (MBT). For a first-order Lagrangian with singular pre-symplectic form, each iteration of the Barcelos-Neto-Wotzasek algorithm produces an extended symplectic matrix of canonical bordered form, \\begin{eqnarray}\n  f^{(m)} = \\left( \\begin{matrix}\n  f^{(0)} & B \\\\ -B^{\\mathsf{T}} & 0 \\end{matrix} \\right) \\end{eqnarray} where the bordering block $B$ is determined by the gradients of the consistency constraints. We prove that the nondegeneracy of the extended matrix is governed by the corresponding Schur complement, which is algebraically isomorphic to the Poisson bracket matrix of constraints. As a consequence, the Faddeev-Jackiw algorithm terminates if and only if the constraint algebra is nondegenerate, i.e., when the constraints form a second-class system. This algebraic characterization provides a rigorous foundation for automating the Faddeev-Jackiw procedure symbolically. We present a fully symbolic implementation in the Wolfram Language, and validate the approach on representative mechanical systems with nontrivial constraint structure. The resulting rule-based engine preserves parametric dependencies throughout the reduction, enabling reliable analysis of degeneracy, structural stability (when no bifurcations occur), and possible bifurcation scenarios as critical parameters are varied.",

Extending this approach to general $C^1$ radial potentials is challenging due to the lack of explicit basis functions analogous to Bessel functions. To overcome this difficulty, we consider the equation $-\u0394u + V u = \u03bbu$ on a ball containing $\u03a9$, without imposing boundary conditions, for a collection of values $\u03bb$ forming a fine discretisation of the interval in which eigenvalues are sought. By rewriting the problem in polar coordinates and applying a Fourier expansion with respect to the angular variable, we obtain a decoupled system of ordinary differential equations. These equations are solved numerically using a one-dimensional Finite Element Method, yielding a family of basis functions that are solutions of the equation $-\u0394u + V u = \u03bbu$ on the ball and are independent of the domain $\u03a9$.\n  Dirichlet eigenvalues of $-\u0394+ V$ are then approximated by minimising the boundary values on $\\partial \u03a9$ among linear combinations of the basis functions and identifying those values of $\u03bb$ for which the computed minimum is sufficiently small.

As applications, the gradient bounds imply uniform ellipticity of the equation away from the critical set,which allows one to apply classical elliptic regularity theory and obtain higher regularity of solutions in the noncritical region. Moreover, when the solution grows at most linearly, all cases of our results can be applied in Moser's theory to establish the affine linear rigidity of global solutions. This directly leads to the Liouville-type theorems for global solutions without requiring additional proofs.",

We establish a structural connection between finite-time controllability scoring and approximate optimal experimental design (OED): the finite-time controllability Gramian decomposes additively across nodes, yielding an affine matrix model of the same form as the information-matrix model in OED. This yields a direct correspondence between the volumetric controllability score (VCS) and D-optimality, and between the average energy controllability score (AECS) and A-optimality, implying that the classical D/A invariance gap has a direct analogue in controllability scoring. By contrast, we point out that controllability scoring typically admits a unique optimizer, unlike approximate-OED formulations. Finally, we uncover a long-horizon phenomenon with no OED counterpart: source-like state nodes without a negative self-loop can be increasingly downweighted by AECS as the horizon grows.

In particular, over a pre-approach space, the $\\mathsf{Conv}$-coreflection of the lower Kuratowski convergence approach structure is the lower Kuratowski convergence associated with the $\\mathsf{Conv}$-coreflection of the base space, while the $\\mathsf{Conv}$-reflection is the lower Kuratowski convergence associated with the $\\mathsf{Conv}$-reflection. The $\\mathsf{Conv}$-coreflection of the upper Kuratowski convergence approach is is the upper Kuratowski convergence associated with the $\\mathsf{Conv}$-reflection of the base space, while the $\\mathsf{Conv}$-reflection is the upper Kuratowski convergence associated with the $\\mathsf{Conv}$-coreflection of the base space. We show that, over an approach space, the lower Kuratowski convergence approach structure is in fact an approach structure that coincides with the $\\vee$-Vietoris approach structure introduced by Lowen and his collaborators, though it may be strictly finer over a general convergence approach space. We show that the upper Fell convergence approach structure is a non-Archimedean approach structure coarser than the upper Kuratowski convergence approach, but finer than the upper Fell approach structure introduced by the first and third author. We also obtain a $\\mathsf{Cap}$ abstraction of the classical result that if the upper Kuratowski convergence over a topological space is pretopological, then it is also topological.",

    "abstract": "The Schr\u00f6dinger equation in high dimensions describes the evolution of a quantum system. Assume that we are given the evolution map sending each initial state $f\\in L^2(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ of the system to the corresponding final state at a fixed time $T$. The main question we address in this paper is whether this initial-to-final-state map uniquely determines the Hamiltonian $-\u0394+V$ that generates the evolution. We restrict attention to time-independent potentials $V$ and show that uniqueness holds provided $V \\in L^1(\\mathbb{R}^n)\\cap L^q(\\mathbb{R}^n)$, with $q>1$ if $n=2$ or $q\\geq n/2$ if $n\\geq 3$. This should be compared with the results of Caro and Ruiz, who proved that in the time-dependent case, uniqueness holds under the stronger assumption that the potential exhibits super-exponential decay at infinity, for both bounded and unbounded potentials. This paper extends earlier work of the same authors, where uniqueness was obtained for bounded time-independent potentials with polynomial decay at infinity. Here we only require $L^1$-type decay at infinity and allow for $L^q$-type singularities. We reach this improvement by providing a refinement of the Kenig-Ruiz-Sogge resolvent estimate, which replaces the classical Agmon-H\u00f6rmander estimates used previously. Crucially, the time-independent setting allows us to avoid the use of complex geometrical optics solutions and thereby dispense with strong decay assumptions at infinity.",

We establish exponential local convergence in $\u03c7^2$-divergence with sharp rates, under two main assumptions: (i) the stationary measures satisfy a Poincar\u00e9 inequality, and (ii) the velocity field satisfies a monotonicity condition, which reduces to linear convexity of the objective in the gradient flow case. We do not assume any form of displacement convexity or displacement monotonicity.\n  In the gradient flow case, global exponential convergence is already known under our linear convexity assumption, with an asymptotic rate governed by the log-Sobolev constant of the stationary measure. Our contribution in this setting is to identify the sharp rate near equilibrium governed instead by the Poincar\u00e9 constant. This rate coincides with the one suggested by Otto calculus (i.e. by a tight positivity estimate of the Wasserstein Hessian), and refines some results of Tamura (1984), extending them beyond quadratic objectives.\n  More importantly, our proof technique extends to certain non-gradient systems, such as linearly monotone two-player and multi-player games. In this case, we obtain explicit local exponential convergence rates in $\u03c7^2$-divergence, thereby partially answering the open question raised by the authors at COLT 2024. While that question concerns global convergence (which remains open), even local convergence results were previously unavailable.\n  At the heart of our analysis is the design of a Lyapunov functional that mixes the $\u03c7^2$-divergence with weighted negative Sobolev norms of the density relative to equilibrium.",

    "abstract": "We study the optimal transmission and scheduling policy for a transmitter (source) communicating with two gossiping receivers aiming at tracking the source's status over time using the age of information (AoI) metric. Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks.",

In this work, we study the design of communication rate-optimal device-to-device (D2D) coded caching schemes with minimal subpacketization levels, a key bottleneck in finite-length settings. We present a novel \\tit{packet type-based} (PT) design framework that (i) strategically introduces \\tit{asymmetry} into file splitting through user grouping, and (ii) systematically exploits such asymmetry in both cache placement and multicast delivery to create subpacketization reduction opportunities. In particular, the induced asymmetry gives rise to two fundamental forms of subpacketization reduction gains: the \\emph{subfile saving gain}, achieved by eliminating certain types of subfiles through careful user grouping and transmitter selection, and the \\emph{further splitting saving gain}, attained by reducing the splitting granularity for the remaining subfiles. The combined effect of these two reduction gains yields an overall subpacketization improvement over the original Ji-Caire-Molisch (JCM) caching scheme~\\cite{ji2016fundamental}, as well as various state-of-the-art schemes, while preserving optimal communication rates.\n  Under the PT framework, we formulate the caching scheme design as an integer linear program (ILP), where each feasible solution corresponds to a valid rate-optimal D2D coded caching scheme with potentially reduced subpacketization relative to the JCM baseline.",

    "title": "The Cylinder Simplicial DG Ring",
    "abstract": "Given a DG ring $B$ and an integer $q \\geq 0$, we construct the $q$-th cylinder DG ring $Cyl_q(B)$. For $q = 1$ this is just Keller's cylinder DG ring, sometimes called the path object of $B$, which encodes homotopies between DG ring homomorphisms $A \\to B$.\n  As $q$ changes the cylinder DG rings form a simplicial DG ring $Cyl(B)$. Hence, given another DG ring $A$, the DG ring homomorphisms $A \\to Cyl(B)$ form a simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$. Our main theorem states that when $A$ is a semi-free DG ring, the simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$ is a Kan complex.\n  For the verification of the Kan condition we introduce a new construction, which may be of independent interest. Given a horn $Y$, we define the DG ring $N(Y,B)$, and we prove that $N(Y,B)$ represents this horn in the simplicial set $Hom(A,Cyl(B))$. In this way the Kan condition is implemented intrinsically in the category of DG rings, thus facilitating calculations.\n  Presumably all the above can be extended, with little change, from DG rings to (small) DG categories. That would enable easy constructions and explicit calculations of some simplicial aspects of DG categories.",

    "abstract": "Le Hou\u00e9rou, Patey and Yokoyama defined a parameterized version of $\u03b1$-largeness to prove that $\\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \\mathsf{RT}^2_2$ is a $\\forall \u03a3^0_3$-conservative extension of $\\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \\mathsf{B}\u03a3^0_2$, where $\\forall \u03a3^0_3$ is the universal set-closure of the class of $\u03a3^0_3$-formulas. We introduce a variant of this notion of largeness and obtain polynomial bounds, using a tree partition theorem based on Milliken's tree theorem. Thanks to the framework of forcing interpretation, this yields that any proof of a $\\forall \u03a3^0_3$-sentence in the theory $\\mathsf{WKL}_0 + \\mathsf{RT}^2_2$ can be translated into a proof in $\\mathsf{RCA}_0 + \\mathsf{B}\u03a3^0_2$ at the cost of a polynomial increase in size.",

    "title": "Half-plane non-coexistence without FKG",
    "abstract": "For $\u03bc$ an edge percolation measure on the infinite square lattice, let $\u03bc_{\\textit{hp}}$ (respectively, $\u03bc^*_{hp}$) denote its marginal (respectively, the marginal of its planar dual process) on the upper half-plane. We show that if $\u03bc$ is translation-invariant and ergodic and almost surely has only finitely many infinite clusters, then either almost surely $\u03bc_{hp}$ has no infinite cluster, or almost surely $\u03bc^*_{hp}$ has no infinite cluster. By the classical Burton--Keane argument, these hypotheses are satisfied if $\u03bc$ is translation-invariant and ergodic and has finite-energy. In contrast to previous ``non-coexistence'' theorems, our result does not impose a positive-correlation (FKG) hypothesis on $\u03bc$. Our arguments also apply to the random-cluster model (including the regime $q<1$, which lacks FKG), the uniform spanning tree, and the uniform odd subgraph.",

    "title": "A resistance invariant of special alternating links",
    "abstract": "We introduce a new numerical invariant for special, reduced, alternating diagrams of oriented knots and links, defined in terms of the Laplacian matrix of the associated Tait graph. For a special alternating diagram, the Laplacian encodes both the combinatorics of the checkerboard graph and the crossing signs. While its spectrum depends on the chosen diagram, we show that a specific quadratic trace expression involving the Laplacian and its Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is invariant under flype moves. The invariant admits an interpretation in terms of total effective resistance of the associated weighted graph viewed as an electrical network. Explicit computations for pairs of flype-related diagrams demonstrate that, although the Laplacian characteristic polynomials differ, the invariant FP coincides. Values for several prime alternating knots are provided.",

    "abstract": "The higher connectivity at infinity for mapping class groups of surfaces with boundary components and punctures is understood with the exceptions of the mapping class groups for the closed surfaces of genus 3 and 4. In this paper we prove a general simply connected at infinity result for finitely presented groups that implies all mapping class groups of closed surfaces of genus $\\geq 3$ are simply connected at infinity. As these groups are duality groups the Proper Hurewicz Theorem implies that they are $(n-2)$-connected at infinity where $n$ is the dimension of the group. Combining this result with earlier work we give a complete list of all mapping class groups and their connectivity at infinity.",

    "abstract": "For an orientable closed surface $(\u03a3,g)$ of genus $G$ with Anosov geodesic flow, we show the existence of an open subset $U_g$ of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the fundamental group of its unit tangent bundle, whose complement has complex codimension at least one and such that for any $\u03c1\\in U_g$, the twisted Ruelle zeta function $\u03b6_{g,\u03c1}(s)$ vanishes at $s=0$ to order ${\\rm dim}(\u03c1)(2G-2)$ if $\u03c1$ factors through $\u03c0_1(\u03a3)$, and does not vanish otherwise. In the second case, we show that $\u03b6_{g,\u03c1}(0)$ is given by the Reidemeister--Turaev torsion, thus extending Fried's conjecture to a generic set of acyclic (but not necessarily unitary) representations. Our proof relies on computing the dimensions of the spaces of generalized twisted Pollicott--Ruelle resonant states at zero for any $\u03c1\\in U_g$.",
