    "abstract": "This paper develops a unified perspective on several stochastic optimal control formulations through the lens of Kullback-Leibler regularization. We propose a central problem that separates the KL penalties on policies and transitions, assigning them independent weights, thereby generalizing the standard trajectory-level KL-regularization commonly used in probabilistic and KL-regularized control. This generalized formulation acts as a generative structure allowing to recover various control problems. These include the classical Stochastic Optimal Control (SOC), Risk-Sensitive Optimal Control (RSOC), and their policy-based KL-regularized counterparts. The latter we refer to as soft-policy SOC and RSOC, facilitating alternative problems with tractable solutions. Beyond serving as regularized variants, we show that these soft-policy formulations majorize the original SOC and RSOC problem. This means that the regularized solution can be iterated to retrieve the original solution. Furthermore, we identify a structurally synchronized case of the risk-seeking soft-policy RSOC formulation, wherein the policy and transition KL-regularization weights coincide. Remarkably, this specific setting gives rise to several powerful properties such as a linear Bellman equation, path integral solution, and, compositionality, thereby extending these computationally favourable properties to a broad class of control problems.",

    "abstract": "In this manuscript, we develop and analyze a continuous version of the well-known Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko (BDY) dollar-exchange discrete model. Starting from the conservative BDY exchange mechanism, we rely on kinetic theory for multi-agent systems in order to propose an analogue continuous dynamics, which does not belong to the class of other popular kinetic models for wealth exchange. We employ the quasi-invariant limit procedure to rigorously derive a nonlinear PDE on the half-line, which is a Fokker-Planck equation featuring the boundary value in the drift term. The PDE is supplemented with a nonlinear Robin-type boundary condition encoding conservation of total agents and wealth. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution, which converges in relative entropy to the unique stationary state that is the Boltzmann-Gibbs (exponential) distribution. We determine the $L^1$ convergence (up to subsequences) of the solution toward this equilibrium: this requires us to make a step forward with respect to established arguments of entropy decay for Fokker-Planck equations. Thus, our results, which bridge the discrete stochastic dynamics with a continuous deterministic evolution equation, provide a novel and influential wealth exchange model in a PDE framework, which opens up many new applicative scenarios and methodological analytical challenges.",

From the point of view of functional analysis we deal with a linear operator equation, which, taking advantage of the observation that the associated operator, acting from the space of dwell times into the space of measurement data, is close to a finite-dimensional one, can be solved employing the pseudoinverse operator. For the main case of interest we describe the behavior of the singular vectors inside the domain, on which measurement data are given, which turn out to be close to functions $e^{ikx}$. Heuristically, these singular vectors are similar to eigenfunctions of the infinitely deep quantum well. An alternative problem formulation, closer to practical calculations, utilizes reconstructing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) and radial basis functions, which are used for pointwise approximation of measurement data and ensuing dwell time determination. Depending on the particularities of the concrete problem either framework or a suitable combination of each can be used.",

The space derivatives are approximated by the mixed finite element method ($\\mathcal{P}_{p}/\\mathcal{P}_{p-1}/\\mathcal{P}_{p-1}$), while the interpolation technique is employed in two stages to approximate the time derivative. The proposed strategy is so-called, a two-stage explicit/implicit computational technique combined with mixed finite element method. Specifically, the new algorithm should be observed as a predictor-corrector numerical scheme. Additionally, it efficiently treats the time derivative term and provides a necessary requirement on time step for stability. Under this time step limitation, the stability is deeply analyzed whereas the convergence order is numerically obtained in the $L^{2}$-norm. The theoretical results suggest that the developed approach is spatial fourth-order convergent and temporal second-order accurate. Some numerical experiments are carried out to confirm the theoretical results and to demonstrate the practical applicability of the new algorithm.",

    "title": "Trajectory Optimization for Cellular-Connected UAV in Complex Environment with Partial CKM",
    "abstract": "Cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to play an increasingly important role in future wireless networks. To facilitate the reliable navigation for cellular-connected UAVs, channel knowledge map (CKM) is considered a promising approach capable of tackling the non-negligible co-channel interference resulting from the high line-of-sight (LoS) probability of air-ground (AG) channels. Nevertheless, due to measurement constraints and the aging of information, CKM is usually incomplete and needs to be regularly updated to capture the dynamic nature of complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel trajectory design strategy in which UAV navigation and CKM completion are incorporated into a common framework, enabling mutual benefits for both tasks. Specifically, a cellular-connected UAV deployed in an urban environment measures the radio information during its flight and completes the CKM with Kriging interpolation. Based on the method of grid discretization and spherical approximation, a mixed-integer multi-objective optimization problem is formulated. The problem falls into the category of combinatorial mathematics and is essentially equivalent to determining an optimum sequence of grid points to traverse. Through proper mathematical manipulation, the problem is reformulated as variants of two classic models in graph theory, namely the shortest-path problem (SPP) and the traveling salesman problem (TSP). Two navigation strategies based on the two different models are proposed and thoroughly compared based on numerical results to provide implementable methods for engineering practice and reveal the trade-offs between UAV navigation and CKM completion. Simulation results reveal that the proposed navigation strategies can quickly expand the Pareto boundary of the problem and approach the performance of fully-known CKM.",

In the case where $B$ is compact, we show that this intersection, considered as a mapping, is right semicontinuously on $r$ in the topology generated by Hausdorff distance. Moreover, if $A$ and $B$ are convex subsets of a normed space $X$, then we prove that $F_r$ depends continuously on $r$ in such topology if and only if the Hausdorff distance between different sets $F_r$ is finite. We also show that for normed spaces $X$ of dimension $2$ or less, the latter condition is automatically fulfilled.

The branch point at infinity $P_\\infty$ is selected to be a marked point on the Riemann surfaces. A meromorphic differential $\u03a9$ with a unique pole being of order two at $P_\\infty$, is completely defined by the values of half of its periods, the $a$-periods. Fixing values of $a$-periods of $\u03a9$, we then find a continuous subfamily in the considered family of hyperelliptic curves along which all the periods of $\u03a9$ are constant. This subfamily is defined by the functions $u_j(x_1, \\dots, x_g)$, while $x_1, \\dots, x_g$ are independent parameters. We derive a system of differential equations for the functions $u_j(x_1, \\dots, x_g)$, which, remarkably, has rational coefficients. We call this subfamily the isoperiodic deformations of the hyperelliptic curves relative to the given differential of the second kind $\u03a9.$ We deduce necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of isoperiodic deformations. We discuss reality conditions as well. Using the obtained results, we solve the following problem for the Korteweg-de Vries and sine-Gordon equations: starting from an algebro-geometric data which generate a real periodic solution of a period $T$, how to deform the data, so that the associated solutions remain periodic with the same period $T$.",

First, I explain that every model $M$ of the theory of finite arithmetic -- arithmetic with a largest number, in which addition and multiplication are merely partial functions -- is bi-interpretable with a strictly taller model $M^+$, in which the arithmetic operations on objects taken from the original base model $M$ are totally defined in the extended world $M^+$. More generally, I explain how ultrafinitist ideas emerge in the modal potentialist system consisting of all models of arithmetic under end-extension.",

Thus, this paper attempts to contribute to the studies developed by Gauss, Bolyai, Lobachevsky and Riemann. However, this study mainly concentrates on the action of suborbital graphs obtained with the Modular congruence subgroup $\u0393_0(L,M)$, making this study sui generis since it deals with the Modular group, connected to two numbers. In developing our graph action, we utilized the theories of non-Euclidean geometry. Investigating the congruence relation other than identity and universal relation, the number of congruence relation, transitive act on vertices and edges, edge condition for the congruence group $\u0393_0(L,M)$, based on previously-obtained studies, we concluded with new theorems in this study. So, the results are obtained in this paper related to a different congruence modular subgroup provides various aspects of the same structure in mathematics and adapting it to such as algebraic geometry, number theory, differential geometry, topology and physics.

As our first main result, we establish the tightness of the known convergence rates of \\texttt{PolyakGD} by explicitly constructing worst-case functions. In particular, we show that the $\\mathcal{O}((1-\\frac{1}\u03ba)^K)$ rate for smooth strongly convex functions and the $\\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ rate for smooth convex functions are both tight. Moreover, we theoretically show that \\texttt{PolyakGD} automatically exploits floating-point errors to escape the worst-case behavior. Our second main result provides new convergence guarantees for \\texttt{PolyakGD} under both H\u00f6lder smoothness and H\u00f6lder growth conditions.

    "abstract": "Polynomial optimization problems (POPs) can be reformulated as geometric convex conic programs, as shown by Kim, Kojima, and Toh (SIOPT 30:1251-1273, 2020), though such formulations remain NP-hard. In this work, we prove that several well-known relaxations can be unified under a common polyhedral-SDP framework, which arises by approximating the intractable cone by tractable intersections of polyhedral cones with the positive semidefinite matrix cone. Although effective in providing tight lower bounds, these relaxations become computationally expensive as the number of variables and constraints grows at the rate of $\u03a9(n^{2\u03c4})$ with the relaxation order $\u03c4$. To address this challenge, we propose RiNNAL-POP, a low-rank augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) tailored to solve large-scale polyhedral-SDP relaxations of POPs. To efficiently handle the $\u03a9(n^{2\u03c4})$ nonnegativity and consistency constraints, we design a tailored projection scheme whose computational cost scales linearly with the number of variables. In addition, we identify a hidden facial structure in the polyhedral-SDP relaxation, which enables us to eliminate a large number of linear constraints by restricting the matrix variable to affine subspaces corresponding to exposed faces of the semidefinite cone. The latter enables us to efficiently solve the factorized ALM subproblems over the affine subspaces. At each ALM iteration, we additionally carry out a single projected gradient step with respect to the original matrix variable to automatically adjust the rank and escape from spurious local minima when necessary. We also extend our RiNNAL-POP algorithmic framework to solve moment-SOS relaxations of POPs. Extensive numerical experiments on various benchmark problems demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of RiNNAL-POP in solving large-scale polyhedral-SDP relaxations.",

While persistent homology effectively identifies topological features, such as cycles associated with periodicity, a rigorous statistical framework for quantifying the uncertainty of these features has been lacking in this context. In this paper, we propose a subsampling based method to construct confidence sets for persistence diagrams derived from time-delay embeddings. We establish finite sample guarantees for the validity of these confidence bounds under regularity conditions specifically for $C^{1,1}$ functions with positive reach and prove their asymptotic convergence as the embedding dimension tends to infinity. This framework provides a principled statistical test for periodicity, enabling the distinction between true periodic signals and non-periodic approximations. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves detection performance comparable to the Generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram on periodic data while exhibiting superior robustness in distinguishing non-periodic signals with time-varying frequencies, such as chirp signals.",

Unlike the majority of currently solved instances, which belong to a special class where all receivers with a certain side-information cardinality are either present or absent, we consider more general instances without this constraint. We devise a novel algorithm that constructs a decoding chain by iteratively adding a message that can be decoded by a receiver whose side information is already in the chain. If the decoding chain cannot proceed due to the absence of a receiver with the required messages, we skip a message by adding it to the chain regardless. We prove that a lower bound on the optimal broadcast rate is a function of the number of skipped messages, across all possible decoding choices of the receivers and any realisation of the algorithm for each decoding choice. While this result is not computationally feasible in isolation, it serves as a basis for deriving explicit lower bounds on the broadcast rate for specific classes of pliable-index-coding instances. These lower bounds depend on the number of absent receivers or the pattern of their side-information sets. Specifically, we explicitly characterise the optimal broadcast rate for instances with up to and including four absent receivers with any side-information pattern, as well as instances where the side-information sets are nested in particular ways.",

We consider a pair of novel exactly-solvable optimization problems that provide both the lower and upper bounds of the performance index of a diffusion bridge. Our formulation is based on the Girsanov transformation, in which the model uncertainty is measured through relative entropy. We provide a sufficient condition under which these optimization problems are well-posed, and hence admit the corresponding maximizer/minimizer that achieves the worst-case lower and upper bounds given the ambiguity aversion or uncertainty size. We apply the proposed method to the latest 10-min, high-resolution fish count data of a migratory fish in a river and discuss the influence of model uncertainty on the estimation of the total fish count, which is an important problem in resource and environmental management.",

In case (ii), we give a characterization of the dual hierarchy, in terms of sums of squares of Hermitian complex polynomials, extending a known result in the generic case.

We establish several fundamental structural results: scalar extensions preserve both the algebraic structure and simplicity; intermediate subalgebras associated with subgroups $\\ZZ \\subseteq \\cB \\subseteq \\cA$ remain simple; the algebra of graded derivations is isomorphic to a semidirect product $\\Weyl{e^{\\pm x^p e^{t}},\\; e^{\\cA x},\\; x^{\\cA}} \\rtimes \\FF^n$; tensor products over disjoint variable sets decompose naturally into larger algebras; and a complete isomorphism criterion is given, showing that isomorphism depends precisely on the orbit of the parameter $p$ under the automorphism group of $\\cA$ and the equality of the deformation parameter $t$. These theorems generalize classical results on Weyl and Witt algebras, provide new families of simple algebras, and offer a foundation for further research in deformation theory, representation theory, and cohomology.",

Our starting point is the Dousse--Konan reformulation of the $(\\mathrm{KMN})^2$ crystal character formula, applied to the level-one perfect crystal $B=B(\u03b8)\\sqcup B(0)$ of Benkart--Frenkel--Kang--Lee with ground element $\u03c6\\in B(0)$. This realizes the normalized character $e^{-\u039b_0}\\mathrm{ch} L(\u039b_0)$ as generating functions of grounded $B$-colored partitions governed locally by the crystal energy. After principal specialization, we obtain a colored partition model subject to explicit difference, congruence, and initial conditions. On the product side, under the same specialization, the Weyl--Kac character formula yields an explicit Euler-type product, equivalently the generating function for partitions with parts in a concrete allowed set. Comparing the two specializations gives coefficientwise equalities of generating functions. A key computational feature is that the difference matrix can be produced from the crystal data without explicitly computing the energy function. For each type we tabulate the congruence data, forbidden initial parts, and the full difference matrix, and we provide reproducible coefficient checks.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a quantitative framework for analyzing the mean-square exponential stabilization of stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise, focusing specifically on the optimal stabilizing rate, which characterizes the fastest exponential stabilization achievable under admissible control policies. \nOur contributions are twofold. First, we extend norm-based techniques from deterministic switched systems to the stochastic setting, deriving a verifiable necessary and sufficient condition for the exact attainability of the optimal stabilizing rate, together with computable upper and lower bounds. Second, by restricting attention to state-feedback policies, we reformulate the optimal stabilizing rate problem as an optimal control problem with a nonlinear cost function and derive a Bellman-type equation. Since this Bellman-type equation is not directly tractable, we recast it as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem whose valid solutions require strictly positive-definite matrices. To ensure the existence of such solutions, we introduce a regularization scheme and develop a Regularized Normalized Value Iteration (RNVI) algorithm, which in turn generates strictly positive-definite fixed points for a perturbed version of original nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem while producing feedback controllers. Evaluating these regularized solutions further yields certified lower and upper bounds for the optimal stabilizing rate, resulting in a constructive and verifiable framework for determining the fastest achievable mean-square stabilization under multiplicative noise.",

The method we proposed here, solves the problem of early exercise by introducing a front-fixing technique that permits for efficient and accurate valuation of an American put option. As in the comparison to other approaches in the existing literature, we can assert that this method is stable, accurate, consistent, and efficient. The results that we obtained here from the numerical experiments demonstrate not only the efficacy of the proposed method but also in consistently and accurately pricing American put options with a stable scheme. Under some appropriate conditions on the step size discretization, we also show the positivity and monotonicity of the coefficient involved in the numerical scheme used.",

    "abstract": "The contact process, or SIS epidemic, is a continuous-time Markov process used to model the spread of infection on a graph. Each vertex is either healthy or infected, and each infected vertex independently infects each of its healthy neighbors at rate $\u03bb$ and recovers at rate $1$. We study the contact process in the presence of additional intervention measures by introducing a third possible state for vertices, which we call isolated. Vertices may enter the isolated state either because of individual decisions or due to community-influenced decisions, which leads to two distinct models that we call the isolation model and the vigilance model, respectively. In the isolation model, infected vertices self-isolate at rate $\u03b1$. In the vigilance model, each healthy vertex causes each of its infected neighbors to isolate at rate $\u03b1$. Unlike the usual contact process, these models lack the key features of attractiveness and existence of a dual, which makes analyzing them more challenging. We study the persistence times of the infection on large, finite, degree-heterogeneous random graphs. We show that the infection in the isolation model persists for at least stretched exponential time in the size of the graph for all values of $\u03b1$ and $\u03bb$. By contrast, in the vigilance model, for every fixed $\u03b1$ the persistence time of the infection exhibits a phase transition in $\u03bb$: for small $\u03bb$ the infection persists for at most a linear time in the size of the graph, while for large $\u03bb$ the infection persists exponentially long. This contrast demonstrates that individual versus community-influenced isolation can substantially affect the persistence of an epidemic.",

We further introduce a new quasi-interpolation operator into finite element spaces, a variant of the classical Scott--Zhang interpolation, whose associated constants scale polynomially with the dimension. Building on these ingredients, we prove a multilevel norm equivalence theorem and derive a BPX preconditioner with explicit polynomial bounds on its dimensional dependence. This result has notable implications for emerging quantum computing methodologies: recent studies indicate that polynomial dependence of BPX preconditioners on dimension can yield exponential speedups for quantum-algorithmic approaches over their classical counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Future wireless networks will utilize extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) over high-frequency bands, which, however, produce near-field spherical wavefronts and spatial wideband effects. To exploit and mitigate these, this paper proposes a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-enabled transmit scheme for wideband near-field communications (NFC). Our solution leverages true-time-delay (TTD)-based hybrid beamfocusing architectures to mitigate spatial wideband effect and reduce radio frequency chain requirements. The objective is to maximize the minimum rate by jointly optimizing frequency-dependent analog beamfocusing, frequency-independent analog beamfocusing, digital beamfocusing, and common rate allocation. To solve this complicated non-convex problem, we develop a penalty-based iterative algorithm that partitions the variables into three blocks and then employs block coordinate descent (BCD) to optimize each block alternately. This algorithm is further extended to support the sub-connected TTD-based analog beamfocusing architectures. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that our transmit scheme: 1) effectively compensates for spatial wideband effect, addressing a critical challenge in wideband operation; 2) achieves performance comparable to full digital beamfocusing while maintaining lower hardware complexity; 3) achieves substantial performance gains over the other two benchmarks.",

We also identify two sharp obstructions to global approximation: (i) an Orlicz tail-mismatch condition that induces a strictly positive forward-KL gap, and (ii) structural restrictions, such as non-autoregressive Gaussian kernels, that force \"branch collapse'' in conditional distributions. For each obstruction we give a minimal structural modification that restores approximability.\n  On the optimization side, we establish finite-sample oracle inequalities and prove that the empirical SIVI objectives L(K,n) $\u0393$-converge to their population limit as n and K tend to infinity. These results give consistency of empirical maximizers, quantitative control of finite-K surrogate bias, and stability of the resulting variational posteriors.\n  Combining the approximation and optimization analyses yields the first general end-to-end statistical theory for SIVI: we characterize precisely when SIVI can recover the target distribution, when it cannot, and how architectural and algorithmic choices govern the attainable asymptotic behavior.",

The natural frequency function determines the emergent dynamics of the SCKM, and we emphasize that singularity plays a crucial role in the occurrence of sticking phenomena. For the identical natural frequency function, we derive the complete phase synchronization in finite time under a suitable set of conditions for system parameters and initial data. In contrast, for a nonidentical natural frequency function, we show the emergence of practical synchronization, meaning that the phase diameter is proportional to the inverse of coupling strength asymptotically. Furthermore, we rigorously establish a graph limit from the singular Kuramoto model with a finite system size to the SCKM. We also provide several numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results.",

First, we construct the explicit polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) using a least-squares approach. Then, f is reconstructed by solving the degree-2 polynomial equation a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0 for any $x \\in [-1,1]$, where an index function is used to select the correct sign in the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula-based nonlinear approximation (degree-2 in f) outperforms classical orthogonal polynomial-based least-squares approximation (degree-0 in f) and rational approximation (degree-1 in f) for functions with sharp transitions or discontinuities. As a potential application, we apply the degree-2 representation to data denoising. Instead of relying on more complex \"edge-preserving\" metric-based optimization techniques, the smooth coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x) enable effective least-squares-based denoising on the low-dimensional manifold described by the algebraic variety a(x) f^2 - b(x) f - c(x)=0. Denoising the index function, which determines the appropriate root to select, can be achieved using classical statistical or modern classification/clustering techniques. Numerical results and data denoising examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the degree-2 nonlinear approximation technique. The new nonlinear, quadratic formula-based representation also raises theoretical and numerical questions, including strategies for identifying numerically stable representations, developing optimal algorithms to construct the polynomial coefficient functions a(x), b(x), and c(x), and achieving economical representation and denoising of the index function.",

All individual subsystems in the ensemble are sparse, governed by the same sparsity pattern, and undergo switching at the same sequence of time instants. The controllability of an ensemble system describes the ability to use a common control input to simultaneously steer every individual system. A sparsity pattern is called structurally controllable for pair \\((k,q)\\) if it admits a controllable ensemble of \\(q\\) individual systems with at most \\(k\\) switches. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a sparsity pattern to be structurally controllable for a given \\((k,q)\\), and characterize when a sparsity pattern admits a finite \\(k\\) that guarantees structural controllability for \\((k,q)\\) for arbitrary $q$. Compared with the linear time-invariant ensemble case, this second condition is strictly weaker. We further show that these conditions have natural connections with maximum flow, and hence can be checked by polynomial algorithms. Specifically, the time complexity of deciding structural controllability is \\(O(n^3)\\) and the complexity of computing the smallest number of switches needed is \\(O(n^3 \\log n)\\), with \\(n\\) the dimension of each individual subsystem.",

    "abstract": "The increase in congestion in surface traffic, airborne pollution, and other environmental issues have motivated the transit authorities to promote public transit worldwide. In big cities and large metropolitan areas, adding new rapid transit lines attracts more commuters to the public system, as they frequently allow saving travel time as compared to the private mode (car) that faces high congestion. In addition, the travel time has less variability with respect to preset schedules, and rapid lines are more efficient than slow modes operated by buses. When a new rapid transit line is constructed, it partially replaces the traffic of existing slow transit lines. As a consequence, some of the slow-mode lines have to be either canceled or their routes modified to collaborate properly with the new rapid transit line. This process is usually carried out in a sequential way, thus leading to suboptimal solutions.\n  In this paper, we consider an integrated model for simultaneously designing rapid and redesigning slow networks. The aim of the model is community-oriented, that is, to maximize the demand covered (or captured) by both modes. We present a mathematical programming formulation that is solved by using a specially improved Benders decomposition. For this purpose, we include a partial decomposition to speed up the computation. The computational experiments are done on a case study based on real data obtained from a survey of mobility among transportation zones in the city of Seville.",

In this paper we rigorously justify that the wave packets for the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system can be approximated by solutions of the NLS equation over a physically relevant $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-2})$ time scale. Besides the difficulties such as resonances at $k=0$ and $k=\\pm k_0$ and loss of derivatives arising in the modulation approximation problem in the isentropic Euler-Poisson system, new difficulties arise in the non-isentropic case. In the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system, new resonances at wave number $k=\\pm 2k_0$ appear which necessitate rescaling the correction to the modulation approximation differently for different wave numbers. In addition, it is more difficult to obtain the uniform estimates for the error $(R_{0},R_{1},R_{-1})$ between the real solutions and the approximate solutions, due to the extra interactions with the temperature. To overcome the difficulties aroused by resonances and loss of derivatives, we find several important structural identities between the diagonalized unknowns and apply a series of normal-form transforms, to obtain uniform estimates for the error over the desired $\\mathcal{O}(\u03b5^{-2})$ long time scale.",

Next, we relate the basic cohomology of a singular Riemannian foliation with that of its blow-up, generalizing well-known, classical analogous results in algebraic and complex geometry.

In particular, when both the number of customers and queues grow, the parameters of the marginal distribution depend on the global characteristics of the network and are explicitly computed from a quadratic equation that arises from the corresponding large-deviation rate functions.

Johansson extended this result by showing the following: For a graph $G$ with $\u03b4(G) \\geq (1/2+\\varepsilon)n$, in the random graph process constrained to the host graph $G$, the hitting times for minimum degree $2$ and Hamiltonicity still coincide with high probability.\n  In this paper, we extend Johansson's result to Berge Hamilton cycles in hypergraphs.

    "abstract": "Spectral methods are renowned for their high accuracy and efficiency in solving partial differential equations. The Fourier pseudo-spectral method is limited to periodic domains and suffers from Gibbs oscillations in non-periodic problems. The Chebyshev method mitigates this issue but requires edge-clustered grids, which does not match the characteristics of many physical problems. To overcome these restrictions, we propose a B-spline-periodized Fourier (BSPF) method that extends to non-periodic problems while retaining spectral-like accuracy and efficiency. The method combines a B-spline approximation with a Fourier-based residual correction. The B-spline component enforces the smooth matching of boundary values and derivatives, while the periodic residual is efficiently treated by Fourier differentiation/integration. This construction preserves spectral convergence within the domain and algebraic convergence at the boundaries. Numerical tests on differentiation and integration confirm the accuracy of the BSPF method superior to Chebyshev and finite-difference schemes for interior-oscillatory data. Analytical mapping further extends BSPF to non-uniform meshes, which enables selective grid refinement in regions of sharp variation. Applications of the BSPF method to the one-dimensional Burgers' equation and two-dimensional shallow water equations demonstrate accurate resolution of sharp gradients and nonlinear wave propagation, proving it as a flexible and efficient framework for solving non-periodic PDEs with high-order accuracy.",

This is sharp in two ways: (1) there cannot be other $*$-isomorphic types of masas of $\\mathcal Q(\\ell_2)$ generated by projections and so, this result gives a complete $*$-isomorphic classification of masas of $\\mathcal Q(\\ell_2)$ generated by projections, (2) some additional set-theoretic hypothesis, like CH, is necessary to have all these C*-algebras as masas of $\\mathcal Q(\\ell_2)$.\n  This shows that masas of the Calkin algebras could have rather unexpected properties compared to the previously known three $*$-isomorphic types of them generated by projections: $\\ell_\\infty/c_0$, $L_\\infty$ and $\\ell_\\infty/c_0\\oplus L_\\infty$.\n  Secondly, without making any additional set-theoretic assumptions we construct a family of maximal possible cardinality (of the power set of $\\mathbb R$) of pairwise non-$*$-isomorphic masas of $\\mathcal Q(\\ell_2)$ generated by projections which (a) are not SAW*-algebras unlike the liftable masas (Gelfand spaces in this group of our masas are not $F$-spaces) (b) do not admit conditional expectations. This improves the results which required additional set-theoretic hypotheses to construct a single masa of $\\mathcal Q(\\ell_2)$ generated by projections without a commutative lift.",

    "abstract": "This work develops a nonlinear analogue of alternating projections on Hilbert space, based on iterating a weighted residual transformation that removes the portion of an operator detected by a projection after conjugation by its square root. Although this map is neither linear nor variational and falls outside classical operator-mean frameworks, the alternating flow between two fixed projections is shown to be monotone and to converge strongly to a positive limit supported on their common kernel. The analysis identifies an intrinsic representation of this limit inside the operator range of the initial datum, which makes it possible to compare the nonlinear limit with the shorted operator of Anderson-Duffin-Trapp. The nonlinear flow always produces an operator dominated by the shorted operator, with equality precisely in the commuting regime. A global energy identity describes how mass is dissipated at each step of the iteration, and a factorized description localizes the gap between the nonlinear limit and the classical shorted operator.",

    "abstract": "In our previous work, we studied the Generalized Hypergeometric Distribution (GHGD), which we refer to as the Multi-set Allocation Occupancy (MAO) distribution. We derived formulas for its expectation and variance for any number of subsets $T$ and overlap count $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le T$), and established an asymptotic property. However, these formulas were complex, and higher moments were not derived. Through further study, we have established a novel function that describes all higher moments of the MAO distribution with a unified, elegant formula. The core definitions are the MAO function $g(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_r) = \\prod_{i=1}^{T} (m_i)_{k_i} \\cdot (n-m_i)_{r-k_i}$ and the MAO norm $\\|(p_1, \\dots, p_r)\\|_T = \\frac{\\sum_{A_1, \\dots, A_r \\subseteq [T] \\; : \\; |A_j|=p_j} g(A_1, \\dots, A_r)}{((n)_r)^{T-1}}$, where $p_i$ is the size of subset $A_i$, $m_i < n$, and $(x)_r$ is the falling factorial. Using these definitions, the intricate moment relations simplify into a unified form: the $\u03bd$-th raw moment of $p(x_{=t})$ and $p(x_{\\ge t})$ can be calculated as $E(x_{=t}^\u03bd) = \\sum_{1 \\le i \\le \u03bd} s_{\u03bd,i} \\|t^i\\|$ and $E(x_{\\ge t}^\u03bd) = \\sum_{1 \\le i \\le \u03bd} s_{\u03bd,i} \\|[t, T]^i\\|$, where $s_{\u03bd,i}$ are Stirling numbers of the second kind and $[t,T] = \\{t, t+1, \\dots, T\\}$. Furthermore, based on the MAO norm, we formulate a novel MAO inequality under the proximity condition $\\max(p_i) - \\min(p_i) \\le 1$: $\\prod_{1\\le i \\le r} \\|(p_i)\\|_T \\ge \\|(p_1, \\dots, p_r)\\|_T$. A direct corollary is the asymptotic property of the MAO distribution: $E(X) > \\text{Var}(X)$ and $E(X) - \\text{Var}(X) = o(E(X))$ as $E(X) \\to 0$.",

This methodology is specifically designed to address the challenges inherent in inverse problems for infinite-dimensional, nonlinear, and nonlocal transport PDEs.\n  We demonstrate the power and versatility of our theory through two canonical examples: inverse problems for both the Mean Field Control (MFC) Dynamic Programming Equation and the Mean Field Game (MFG) Master Equation. Our work provides, for the first time, a unified foundation for identifying cost functions and interaction kernels from value function data. This establishes a new and fertile field of mathematical research with significant implications for both theory and applications in stochastic control and mean field games.",

    "abstract": "We develop a quantitative theory of Lipschitz harmonic functions (LHF) on finitely generated groups, with emphasis on the Lipschitz Liouville property, affine rigidity, and quasi-isometric invariance for groups of polynomial growth. On finitely generated nilpotent groups we prove an affine rigidity theorem: for any adapted, smooth, Abelian-centered probability measure $\u03bc$, every Lipschitz $\u03bc$-harmonic function is affine, $f(x)=c+\\varphi([x])$. For any finite generating set $S$ this yields a canonical isometric identification $$\n  \\mathrm{LHF}(G,\u03bc)/\\mathbb{C} \\cong \\mathrm{Hom}(G_{\\mathrm{ab}},\\mathbb{C}),\\qquad\n  \\|\\nabla_S f\\|_\\infty=\\max_{s\\in S}|\\varphi([s])|, $$ independent of the choice of centered measure. Next, for any finite-index subgroup $H\\le G$ and adapted smooth $\u03bc$ we prove a quantitative induction-restriction principle: restriction along $H$ and an explicit averaging operator give a linear isomorphism $\\mathrm{LHF}(G,\u03bc)\\cong\\mathrm{LHF}(H,\u03bc_H)$, where $\u03bc_H$ is the hitting measure, with two-sided control of the Lipschitz seminorms. For groups of polynomial growth equipped with SAS measures we then show that $\\mathrm{LHF}$ is a quasi-isometry invariant, and use this to construct coarse harmonic coordinates that straighten quasi-isometries up to bounded error. Finally, within the Lyons-Sullivan / Ballmann-Polymerakis discretization framework, we prove a quantitative discrete-to-continuous extension theorem: Lipschitz harmonic data on an orbit extend to globally Lipschitz $L$-harmonic functions on the ambient manifold, with gradient bounds controlled by the background geometry.",

    "abstract": "The growing presence of unauthorized drones poses significant threats to public safety, underscoring the need for aerial surveillance solutions. This work proposes a cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework enabling drone detection within the existing communication network infrastructure, while maintaining communication services. The system exploits the spatial diversity and coordination of distributed access points (APs) in a cell-free massive MIMO architecture to detect aerial passive targets. To evaluate sensing performance, we introduce two key metrics: age of sensing (AoS), capturing the freshness of sensing information, and sensing coverage. The proposed AoS metric includes not only the transmission delays as in the existing models, but also the processing for sensing and networking delay, which are critical in dynamic environments like drone detection. We introduce an ambiguity parameter quantifying the similarity between the target-to-receiver channels for two hotspots and develop a novel network configuration strategy, including hotspot grouping, AP clustering, and sensing pilot assignment, leveraging simultaneous multi-point sensing to minimize AoS. Our results show that the best trade-off between AoS and sensing coverage is achieved when the number of hotspots sharing the same time/frequency resource matches the number of sensing pilots, indicating ambiguity as the primary factor limiting the sensing performance.",

The famous Ebenfelt's SOS conjecture asks for the minimum rank of $A(z,\\bar z)\\|z\\|^2$ under the restriction that $A(z,\\bar z)\\|z\\|^2$ is an SOS. Assume that $A(z,\\bar z)$ is bihomogeneous. In the present note, we establish a connection between Ebenfelt's (Weak) SOS Conjecture and the theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies. By reformulating the conjecture in terms of lattice semigroups and their associated Newton-Okounkov convex bodies, we transform the problem of finding the minimal rank of a prolonged sum-of-squares polynomial into an extremal problem in convex geometry. In particular, we prove that this minimal rank is attained at the extreme points of a specific Newton-Okounkov body. Furthermore, if $A(z,\\bar z)$ is moreover diagonal, we demonstrate that the relevant extreme points are finitely many rational points, thereby reducing the verification of the conjecture to a computationally tractable problem. This work provides a new tool for attacking the SOS Conjecture.",

Since the work of Colombo et al. (Arch. Ration. Mech.

    "abstract": "Several problems in machine learning are naturally expressed as the design and analysis of time-evolving probability distributions. This includes sampling via diffusion methods, optimizing the weights of neural networks, and analyzing the evolution of token distributions across layers of large language models. While the targeted applications differ (samples, weights, tokens), their mathematical descriptions share a common structure. A key idea is to switch from the Eulerian representation of densities to their Lagrangian counterpart through vector fields that advect particles. This dual view introduces challenges, notably the non-uniqueness of Lagrangian vector fields, but also opportunities to craft density evolutions and flows with favorable properties in terms of regularity, stability, and computational tractability. This survey presents an overview of these methods, with emphasis on two complementary approaches: diffusion methods, which rely on stochastic interpolation processes and underpin modern generative AI, and optimal transport, which defines interpolation by minimizing displacement cost. We illustrate how both approaches appear in applications ranging from sampling, neural network optimization, to modeling the dynamics of transformers for large language models.",

    "abstract": "We study a dynamic Bayesian persuasion model called Markovian persuasion. In such a model, the belief of the receiver regarding the current state of a Markov chain $(X_n)_{n\\geq 1}$, over a finite state space $K$, is controlled through signals she obtains from a sender, who observes $(X_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ in real time. At each stage $n\\geq 1$, the receiver takes an action based on his current belief, which together with the realized state of $X_n$, determines the $n$'th stage payoff of the sender. The sender's goal in a Markovian persuasion game is to find a signaling policy that maximizes her expected $\u03b4$-discounted sum of stage payoffs for a discount factor $\u03b4\\in [0,1)$. We show that starting from any invariant distribution $(X_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ the trajectory of the $\u03b4$-discounted value is a monotone decreasing in $\u03b4$. By combining this result with the opposite increasing monotone trajectories found in Lehrer and S.\\ (2025, GEB), we are able to derive an upper bound on the rate of convergence of the $\u03b4$-discounted values (as $\u03b4\\to 1^-$) in the case where $(X_n)_{n\\geq 1}$ is ergodic. The results for the Markovian persuasion model are then extended to the Markov chain games model of Renault (2006, MOR).",

By supporting multiple computational backends such as NumPy, PyTorch, and JAX, FEALPy ensures consistent adaptability across CPU and GPU hardware systems.

Building upon prior work, we integrate advanced multi-deletion correction codes into an existing baseline protocol, which previously relied on single-deletion correction. Our proposed protocol reduces communication cost by leveraging more general partitioning techniques as well as multi-deletion error correction. We derive a generalized upper bound on the expected number of transmitted bits, applicable to a broad class of deletion correction codes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline in communication cost.

We derive optimal regularity results for two distinct models. The first model addresses the transverse oscillations of a fully thermoelastic plate, for which we prove that the associated semigroup is analytic. The second model considers a partially thermoelastic plate composed of two components: a thermoelastic component with nonzero temperature differences and an elastic component unaffected by temperature variations. For this model, we demonstrate that the semigroup \\( S(t) \\) belongs to the Gevrey class of order 4, provided the solutions are radial and symmetric. Both analyticity and Gevrey class membership are qualitative properties that intricately link regularity and stability, driven by robust dissipative mechanisms.

The objective is to minimize the sum of agent-specific composite convex functions over agent-specific private constraint sets. Unlike existing decentralized primal-dual methods that require knowledge of the Lipschitz constants, D-APDB automatically adapts to local smoothness by employing a distributed backtracking step-size search. Each agent relies only on first-order oracles associated with its own objective and constraint functions and on local communications with the neighboring agents, without any prior knowledge of Lipschitz constants. We establish $\\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ convergence guarantees for sub-optimality, infeasibility and consensus violation, under standard assumptions on smoothness and on the connectivity of the communication graph. To our knowledge, when nodes have private constraints, especially when they are nonlinear convex constraints onto which projections are not cheap to compute, D-APDB is the first distributed method with backtracking that achieves the optimal convergence rate for the class of constrained composite convex optimization problems. We also provide numerical results for D-APDB on a distributed QCQP problem illustrating the potential performance gains that can be achieved by D-APDB.",

    "abstract": "In the companion paper of the authors, a general synchronization framework was developed in the paradigmatic context of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations that allows one to precisely study the relation between the determining modes property of the corresponding dynamical system and the ability of certain continuous data assimilation algorithms to reconstruct unobserved state variables from sufficiently many observed state variables in this system, i.e., the reconstruction property. In this framework, the determining modes property and the reconstruction property can be viewed in a unified way as the ability of certain couplings of the Navier-Stokes equations to self-synchronize; due to the bi-directionality of coupling, the coupled system is referred to as an \"intertwinement.\" A central achievement of this framework is to deduce a conceptual equivalence between the determining modes property and the reconstruction property of continuous data assimilation algorithms. In this paper, we prove that there are at least two non-trivial classes of intertwinements to which this framework applies. Moreover, these intertwinements encompass the continuous data assimilation algorithms studied in (Olson, Titi 2003) and (Azouani, Olson, Titi 2014) as special cases. Specifically, we show that there exist two types of intertwinements that are globally well-posed and we identify conditions under which these intertwinements self-synchronize. We emphasize that the intertwinements studied here can be induced by nonlinear perturbations of the underlying system, which are subsequently coupled bi-directionally to a copy of itself. Thus, establishing global well-posedness and suitable global-in-time uniform bounds, which are crucial to proving the claimed synchronization phenomenon, requires careful consideration.",

    "abstract": "We show that objective Martin-Lof randomness and Kolmogorov complexity of instantaneous detailed data lists for $N$ helium gas atoms on $M$ possible energies is necessary and sufficient to directly write down its Helmholtz free energy and thus all thermostatics of the gas. We show that such theory formally precedes application of probability and statistics. Each datum in a list is distinct if $N,M$ are formally well defined and with passive monitoring of thermostatic variables only, each is to be intrinsic. In this introductory paper we consider a low density cool gas of noninteracting He atoms in quantum and classical regimes. Objective definitions of detailed disorder and of thermostatic entropy arise for gas in spontaneous detailed motion along with new insights into irreversible processes and an objective Second Law. Algorithmic probability is rigorously associated with Kolmogorov complexity. A condition for equal a priori probability naturally arises and Fermi-Dirac quantum statistics follows from Martin-Lof randomness.",

While this structure yields closed-form expressions for key performance metrics, its use for deterministic steady-state optimization remains limited. We introduce PG-Flow, a deterministic policy-gradient framework that differentiates through the steady-state flow fixed-point equations, providing exact gradients via implicit differentiation and a local adjoint system while avoiding trajectory sampling and Poisson equations. We establish global convergence under structural assumptions (affine flow operators and convex local costs), and show that acyclic networks admit linear-time computation of both flows and gradients. Numerical experiments on routing control in Jackson networks and energy-arrival control in Energy Packet Networks demonstrate that PG-Flow provides a principled and computationally efficient approach to deterministic steady-state optimization in geometric product-form networks.",

The goal of this paper is to guarantee the well-posedness of the parabolic KWC system.

To overcome this difficulty, results for the pseudo-parabolic type KWC system in [Antil et al., SIAM J. Math. Anal. \\textbf{56}(5), 6422--6445](2024) suggest that the $H^1$-regularity of the time-derivative of the solution plays an essential role in verifying the uniqueness of the solution. In this light, we consider the pseudo-parabolic KWC system as an approximating system of the parabolic one, and focus on the improvements of regularity of solution to the parabolic system. By virtue of this regularity result, we establish the well-posedness theory on the parabolic KWC system.",

The control architecture relies on the offline precomputation of the controllable tube, i.e, a time-indexed sequence of controllable sets. Sets are represented using constrained zonotopes (CZs), which are efficient encodings of convex polytopes that support fast set operations and enable tractable dynamic programming in high dimensions. Online, we obtain a globally optimal control profile by solving a series of one-step optimal control problems. Our key contributions are: (1) free-final-time optimality: we devise an optimal horizon computation algorithm to achieve global optimality; (2) robustness: we handle stochastic uncertainty in both the state and control, with probabilistic guarantees, by constructing bounded disturbance sets; (3) resilience: we develop (i) an optimization-free approach to computing the instantaneous reachable set, i.e., the reachable set from the current state, to enable, for example, large/maximal divert maneuvers, and (ii) an approach to achieving maximal decision-deferral, i.e., maintaining reachability/divert-feasibility to multiple targets for as long as possible. By means of an autonomous precision landing case study, we demonstrate globally optimal free-final-time guidance, robustness to navigation and actuation uncertainties, instantaneous divert envelope computation, and maximal decision-deferral.",

The essential step of the construction is the incorporation of the boundary-defining function among the fields of the theory, which allows us to realise the asymptotic boundary as a space-time submanifold by employing the gauge PDE implementation of Penrose's concept of asymptotically-simple space. In so doing the gauge PDE describing the boundary structure is obtained by restricting to the boundary of spacetime and simultaneously restricting to the boundary of the field space by setting the boundary defining function to zero. To implement this step systematically we introduce a notion of $Q$-boundary which seems to be new. The main concrete result of this work is the construction of the efficient boundary calculus, which gives a recursive procedure to obtain the explicit form of the equations satisfied by the boundary fields and their gauge transformations for boundary dimension $d \\geq 3$. These include obstruction equations (such as Bach equation or Yang-Mills equation for $d=4$) and generalised conservation equations in the subleading sector. In particular, we derive the explicit form of the higher conformal Yang-Mills equation for $d=8$. The approach is very general and, in principle, applies to generic (gauge) fields on the Einstein gravity background producing a conformally-invariant gauge theory on the boundary, which describes their boundary structure. It can be considered as an extension of the Fefferman-Graham construction that takes into account both the leading and the subleading sector of the bulk fields.",

In this respect, firstly, we adopt a more general notion of continued fraction expansions, in place of those arising from the nearest integer algorithms. Secondly, the issue is formulated in terms of zeros of quadratic and Hermitian forms, and a result is proved in terms of certain sequences of matrices associated with them, via continued fraction expansions. The result may be considered as a matrix analogue of Lagrange's theorem in the general framework. The unified approach leads to generalizations of the Lagrange theorem on one hand, and an extended version of a result of Hines (2019) on badly approximable complex numbers, on the other hand.",

    "title": "Double Local-to-Unity: Estimation under Nearly Nonstationary Volatility",
    "abstract": "This article develops a moderate-deviation limit theory for autoregressive models with jointly persistent mean and volatility dynamics. The autoregressive coefficient is allowed to drift toward unity slower than the classical 1/n rate, while the volatility persistence parameter also converges to one at an even slower, logarithmic order, so that the conditional variance process is itself nearly nonstationary and its unconditional moments may diverge. This double localization allows the variance process to be nearly nonstationary and to evolve slowly, as observed in financial data and during asset price bubble episodes. Under standard regularity conditions, we establish consistency and distributional limits for the OLS estimator of the autoregressive coefficient that remains valid in the presence of highly persistent stochastic volatility. We show that the effective normalization for least squares inference is governed by an average volatility scale, and we derive martingale limit theorems for the OLS estimator under joint drift and volatility dynamics. In a mildly stationary regime (where the autoregressive root approaches one from below), the OLS estimator is asymptotically normal. In a mildly explosive regime (where the root approaches one from above), an OLS based self normalized statistic converges to a Cauchy limit. Strikingly, in both regimes, the limiting laws of our statistics are invariant to the detailed specification of the volatility process, even though the conditional variance is itself nearly nonstationary. Overall, the results extend moderate-deviation asymptotics to settings with drifting volatility persistence, unify local to unity inference with nearly nonstationary stochastic volatility, and deliver practically usable volatility robust statistics for empirical work in settings approaching instability and exhibiting bubbles.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of batching laboratory samples in hospital laboratories where samples of different priorities are received continuously with uncertain transportation times. The focus is on optimizing the control strategy for loading a centrifuge to minimize patient turnaround time (TAT). While focusing on samples of patients in life-threatening situations (i.e., vital samples), we propose several online and offline methods, including a stochastic mixed-integer quadratic programming model integrated within a discrete-event system simulation. This paper aims to enhance patient care by providing timely laboratory results through improved batching strategies. The case study, which uses real data from a university hospital, demonstrates that incorporating distributional knowledge of transport times into our decision policy can reduce the median patient TAT of vital samples by 4.9 minutes and the 0.95 quantile by 9.7 minutes, but has no significant effect on low-priority samples. In addition, we show that this is essentially an optimal result by comparison with the upper bound obtained by a perfect-knowledge offline algorithm.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we formulate a geometric theory of elasticity and anelasticity for bodies containing material surfaces with their own elastic energies and distributed surface eigenstrains. Bulk elasticity is written in the language of Riemannian geometry, and the framework is extended to material surfaces by using the differential geometry of hypersurfaces in Riemannian manifolds. Within this setting, surface kinematics, surface strain measures, surface material metric, and the induced second fundamental form follow naturally from the embedding of the material surface in the material manifold. The classical theory of surface elasticity of Gurtin and Murdoch (1975) is revisited and reformulated in this geometric framework, and then extended to anelastic bodies with anelastic material surfaces. Constitutive equations for isotropic and anisotropic material surfaces are formulated systematically, and bulk and surface anelasticity are introduced by replacing the elastic metrics with their anelastic counterparts. The balance laws are derived variationally using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. These include the bulk balance of linear momentum together with the surface balance of linear momentum, whose normal component gives a generalized Laplace's law. As an application, we obtain the complete solution for a spherical incompressible isotropic solid ball containing a cavity filled with a compressible hyperelastic fluid, where the cavity boundary is an anelastic material surface with distributed surface eigenstrains. The analytical and numerical results quantify the effects of surface and fluid eigenstrains on the pressure-stretch response and residual stress.",

Also, Gresnigt has suggested extending Furey's work on quark and lepton families using octonions to three octonion subalgebras of sedenions.

    "abstract": "The diamond relay channel, where a source communicates with a destination via two parallel relays, is one of the canonical models for cooperative communications. We focus on the primitive variant, where each relay observes a noisy version of the source signal and forwards a compressed description over an orthogonal, noiseless, finite-rate link to the destination. Compress-and-forward (CF) is particularly effective in this setting, especially under oblivious relaying where relays lack access to the source codebook. While neural CF methods have been studied in single-relay channels, extending them to the two-relay case is non-trivial, as it requires fully distributed compression without any inter-relay coordination. We demonstrate that learning-based quantizers at the relays can harness input correlations by operating remote, yet in a collaborative fashion, enabling effective distributed compression in line with Berger-Tung-style coding. Each relay separately compresses its observation using a one-shot learned quantizer, and the destination jointly decodes the source message. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme, trained end-to-end with finite-order modulation, operates close to the known theoretical bounds. These results demonstrate that neural CF can scale to multi-relay systems while maintaining both performance and interpretability.",

Remarkably, the only assumption required by this convergence is that ${\\boldsymbol Y}$ is not almost surely a constant.

Finally, we show that it can be used to measure conditional dependence between ${\\boldsymbol Y}$ and ${\\boldsymbol Z}$ conditional on a third random vector ${\\boldsymbol X}$, and prove that the measure is monotonic with respect to the deviation from an independence distribution under certain model restrictions.",

The method builds upon equation-driven Galerkin ROMs constructed from vibration modes and modal-derivative companion vectors, while nonlinear reduced tensors are identified from standard finite element outputs. A database of such ROMs is generated over a set of training samples, and all reduced operators-including the linear stiffness matrix, the quadratic and cubic nonlinear tensors, the Rayleigh damping parameters, and the reduction basis-are interpolated using Radial Basis Functions (RBFs). A global reduced basis is obtained through a two-level POD compression, combined with a MAC-guided reordering strategy to ensure parametric smoothness. The resulting PROM preserves the symmetry and polynomial structure of the reduced equations, enabling robust and efficient adaptation to new parameter values. Analytical parameter sensitivities follow directly from the interpolation model. The approach is demonstrated on a parametrically curved panel and a wing-box with geometric variations, showing excellent agreement with high-fidelity simulations and enabling substantial reductions in computational cost for parametric analyses.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we study the dynamics of similarity classes of tetrahedra generated by the longest-edge bisection (LEB) algorithm. Building on the normalization strategy introduced by Perdomo and Plaza for triangles, we construct a canonical representation of tetrahedra in a normalized space embedded in the product of the hyperbolic half-plane and the hyperbolic half-space model. This representation allows us to define the left and right refinement maps, $\u03a6_L$ and $\u03a6_R$, acting on the space of normalized tetrahedral shapes, and to study their iterative orbits as discrete dynamical systems. Using these maps, we show that the orbit of the space-filling Sommerville tetrahedron contains only 4 similarity classes, 3 of which form an attractive cycle corresponding to the orbit of the path tetrahedron. We also show that small perturbations of elements in those orbits still lead to finite orbits. In addition, we study small perturbations of the regular tetrahedron and show that their orbits are also finite. Extensive numerical exploration of orbits for the other types of tetrahedra suggests that the LEB algorithm does not produce degenerating tetrahedra. Our framework provides a geometric and dynamical foundation for analyzing the shape evolution of tetrahedral meshes and offers a possible route toward an analytic proof of the non-degeneracy property for the tetrahedral partitions generated by the LEB refinements. This property is highly desired in e.g. the finite element methods (FEMs).",

    "abstract": "We investigate parametric estimation of the elasticity parameter in the CKLS diffusion based on high-frequency data. First, we transform the CKLS diffusion to a CIR-type one via a smooth state-space mapping and the general Girsanov change of measure. This transformation enables the applications of existing inference tools for CIR processes while ensuring possibilities of transferring the resulting limit theorems back to the original probability space. However, because Feller's condition fails, many existing high-frequency likelihood-based procedures cannot be applied directly, since their discretization schemes approximate likelihood terms involving the reciprocal of the process by Riemann sums that are no longer well-defined once the paths are allowed to hit zero. Instead, we estimate the drift coefficient of the transformed CIR-type model via a procedure based on its positive Harris recurrence, which is valid in the high-frequency regime. Exploiting the drift-elasticity relationship implied by the CKLS--CIR transformation, with the help of an initial estimation, we obtain an estimator of the CKLS elasticity from the CIR drift estimator in the transformed model. This yields a closed-form estimator of the elasticity parameter with an explicit asymptotic variance. We establish its $p$-consistency, stable convergence in law, and asymptotic normality. Finally, we show that stable convergence in law is invariant under equivalent changes of measure, thereby guaranteeing that the Gaussian limit remains invariant under the original measure.",

Despite the progress in optimal quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), optimal constructions of qLRCs remain largely unexplored, partly due to the fact that the existing bounds for qLRCs are not sufficiently tight. In this paper, we focus on pure qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction. We provide several new bounds for pure qLRCs and demonstrate that they are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we show that a variety of classical QECCs, including quantum Hamming codes, quantum GRM codes, and quantum Solomon-Stiffler codes, give rise to pure qLRCs with explicit parameters. Based on these constructions, we further identify many infinite families of optimal qLRCs with respect to different bounds, achieving code lengths much larger than those of known optimal qLRCs.",

    "abstract": "This paper proves a stability result for a variation of the Erd\u0151s-Ko-Rado theorem in the context of polynomials over finite fields. Let $\\mathcal F$ be a family of polynomials of degree at most $k \\geq 3$ in $\\mathbb F_q[X]$. Call $\\mathcal F$ intersecting if for any two polynomials $f, g$ in $\\mathcal F$, there exists a point $x \\in \\mathbb F_q$ for which $f(x) = g(x)$. An intersecting family is called a star if it consists of all polynomials $f$ with ${\\rm deg } f \\leq k$ such that $f(x) = y$ for some fixed points $x, y \\in \\mathbb F_q$. In this paper we prove that if $\\mathcal F$ is an intersecting family with $|\\mathcal F| \\geq \\frac 1{\\sqrt 2} q^k + \\mathcal O(q^{k-1})$, then $\\mathcal F$ is contained in a star. In fact, we prove that this is still true if we also evaluate the polynomials \"at infinity\", which is equivalent to studying the problem for homogeneous bivariate polynomials.\n  The proof technique extends to a general framework for intersection problems of linear codes $C$. One has to investigate the geometry of the projective system $\\mathcal S$ associated to $C$. If the hyperplanes that don't intersect $\\mathcal S$ are well spread out with respect to the points not on $\\mathcal S$, then one obtains stability results, showing that any intersecting family of reasonably large size is contained in a star.",

This computation allows us to resolve a conjecture of Conant, establishing that the total number $DM(n)$ of distance monoids grows at least exponentially in $n$.

    "abstract": "We study the orbit recovery problem under the rigid-motion group SE(n), where the objective is to reconstruct an unknown signal from multiple noisy observations subjected to unknown rotations and translations. This problem is fundamental in signal processing, computer vision, and structural biology.\n  Our main theoretical contribution is bounding the sample complexity of this problem. We show that if the d-th order moment under the rotation group SO(n) uniquely determines the signal orbit, then orbit recovery under SE(n) is achievable with $N\\gtrsim \u03c3^{2d+4}$ samples as the noise variance $\u03c3^2 \\to \\infty$. The key technical insight is that the d-th order SO(n) moments can be explicitly recovered from (d+2)-order SE(n) autocorrelations, enabling us to transfer known results from the rotation-only setting to the rigid-motion case. We further harness this result to derive a matching bound to the sample complexity of the multi-target detection model that serves as an abstract framework for electron-microscopy-based technologies in structural biology, such as single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET).\n  Beyond theory, we present a provable computational pipeline for rigid-motion orbit recovery in three dimensions. Starting from rigid-motion autocorrelations, we extract the SO(3) moments and demonstrate successful reconstruction of a 3-D macromolecular structure. Importantly, this algorithmic approach is valid at any noise level, suggesting that even very small macromolecules, long believed to be inaccessible using structural biology electron-microscopy-based technologies, may, in principle, be reconstructed given sufficient data.",

For many applications, however, this assumption is overly restrictive. We develop a general framework for analyzing the convergence of kernel interpolation {beyond the native space}. Let $A(\u03a9)$ and $B(\u03a9)$ be Banach spaces with continuous embeddings $\\mathcal{H}_k\\!\\left(\u03a9\\right) \\hookrightarrow A(\u03a9)\\hookrightarrow B(\u03a9)$, assume point evaluation is continuous on $A(\u03a9)$, and that $\\mathcal{H}_k\\!\\left(\u03a9\\right)$ is dense in $A(\u03a9)$.

Moreover, for a subclass of Sobolev kernels (including integer-order Mat\u00e9rn kernels), we prove that the Lebesgue constant is uniformly bounded on $[a,b]\\subset\\mathbb{R}$ under quasi-uniform centers; within our framework this implies supremum norm convergence of the interpolants for every target functions $f \\in C([a,b])$.",

In particular, we identify equivalent optimization and control algorithms that have already been pointed out in the existing literature, but mostly in a scattered way.

    "abstract": "In the context of municipal heat planning, it is imperative to consider the numerous buildings, numbering in the hundreds or thousands, that are involved. This poses particular challenges for model-based energy system optimization, as the number of variables increases with the number of buildings under consideration. In the worst case, the computational complexity of the models experiences an exponential increase with the number of variables. Furthermore, within the context of heat transition, it is often necessary to map extended periods of time (i.e., the service life of systems) with high resolution (particularly in the case of load peaks that occur at the onset of the day). In response to these challenges, the aggregation of input data is a common practice. In general, building blocks or other geographical and urban formations, such as neighbourhoods, are combined. This article explores the potential of incorporating energy performance indicators into the grouping of buildings. The case study utilizes authentic data from the Neu-Schwachhausen district, grouped based on geographical location, building geometry, and energy performance indicators. The selection of energy indicators includes the annual heat consumption as well as the potential for solar energy generation. To this end, a methodology is hereby presented that considers not only the anticipated annual energy quantity, but also its progression over time. We present a full workflow from geodata to a set of techno-socio-economically Pareto-optimal heat supply options. Our findings suggest that it is beneficial to find a balance between geographical position and energy properties when grouping buildings for the use in energy system models.",

Our first main result establishes that, over the moduli space of cscK metrics, the universal moduli space of solutions to Hitchin's equations carries a natural complex structure together with a family of pseudo-K\u00e4hler metrics forming a K\u00e4hler fibration with a K\u00e4hler Ehresmann connection.\n  We then investigate a second universal moduli space, constructed from the space of flat $G$-connections over $\\mathcal{T}$, which admits a nontrivial $J$-dependent K\u00e4hler fibration structure discovered by Hitchin. Using symplectic reduction, we build universal moduli spaces of solutions to the harmonicity equations depending on a coupling constant $\u03b1$, obtaining natural complex and pseudo-K\u00e4hler structures and an explicit K\u00e4hler potential. The main novelty here is that this moduli space is defined by a system coupling the scalar curvature with a cubic term in the Higgs field.

In this paper, we provide a complete algebraic description for the hermitian dual code of any $D_n$-code over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $D_n$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ with $\\gcd(q,n)=1$, through a suitable Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_n]$, and we determine all distinct hermitian self-orthogonal $D_n$-codes over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We also present a thorough representation of the euclidean dual code of any $Q_n$-code over $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where $Q_n$ is a generalised quaternion group of order $4n$ with $\\gcd(q,4n)=1$, via the Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\\mathbb{F}_q[Q_n]$. In particular, since the semisimple group algebras $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[Q_n]$ and $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_{2n}]$ are isomorphic, then the hermitian dual code of any $Q_n$-code has also been fully described. As application of the hermitian dualities computed, we give a systematic construction, via the structure of the group algebra, to obtain quantum error-correcting codes, and in fact we rebuild some already known optimal quantum codes with this methodical approach.",

    "abstract": "Radio frequency (RF)-based indoor localization offers significant promise for applications such as indoor navigation, augmented reality, and pervasive computing. While deep learning has greatly enhanced localization accuracy and robustness, existing localization models still face major challenges in cross-scene generalization due to their reliance on scene-specific labeled data. To address this, we introduce Radiance-Field Reinforced Pretraining (RFRP). This novel self-supervised pretraining framework couples a large localization model (LM) with a neural radio-frequency radiance field (RF-NeRF) in an asymmetrical autoencoder architecture. In this design, the LM encodes received RF spectra into latent, position-relevant representations, while the RF-NeRF decodes them to reconstruct the original spectra. This alignment between input and output enables effective representation learning using large-scale, unlabeled RF data, which can be collected continuously with minimal effort. To this end, we collected RF samples at 7,327,321 positions across 100 diverse scenes using four common wireless technologies--RFID, BLE, WiFi, and IIoT. Data from 75 scenes were used for training, and the remaining 25 for evaluation. Experimental results show that the RFRP-pretrained LM reduces localization error by over 40% compared to non-pretrained models and by 21% compared to those pretrained using supervised learning.",

On the one hand, for non-degenerate SDEs with super-linear drifts, we propose a novel modified Euler scheme and establish the corresponding non-asymptotic convergence bound under the multiplicative type quasi-Wasserstein distance\n  by the aid of the asymptotic reflection by coupling. As a direct application of the theory derived, we explore the non-asymptotic convergence bound of the modified tamed/truncated Euler scheme\n  and, as a byproduct, furnish the associated non-asymptotic convergence rate under the $L^1$-Wasserstein distance although the\n  dissipativity at infinity is not in force. On the other hand, we tackle the non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the Euler scheme corresponding to a kind of degenerate SDEs, where the underdamped Langevin SDE is a typical candidate. To handle such setting, we also appeal to a carefully tailored coupling approach, where the ingredient in the coupling construction lies in that a proper metric and a suitable substitute in the cut-off function and the reflection matrix need to be chosen appropriately. In addition, as a consequent application, the non-asymptotic convergence bound and the $L^1$-Wasserstein convergence rate are revealed for the kinetic Langevin sampler.",

As a starting point, we first establish the existence and smoothness of joint densities for the finite-dimensional distributions of the solution in the general context of hypoellitpic SDEs driven by Gaussian rough paths. We then turn to the fBM setting and derive a local upper bound for the joint density in terms of the control distance.

Persistence diagrams do not carry intrinsic spectral or kernel structures, so applications typically use auxiliary vectorizations of diagrams. Virtual persistence diagrams, given by the Grothendieck completion of finite diagrams with the $W_1$ metric, yield a group structure with additive cancellation and a translation-invariant metric. For a finite metric pair $(X,d,A)$ we use the identification $K(X,A)\\cong \\mathbb Z^{|X\\setminus A|}$ and parametrize its Pontryagin dual torus. The Lipschitz seminorms of characters in the $W_1$ geometry are expressed in terms of edgewise phase differences on the quotient $X/A$. A weighted graph Laplacian on $X/A$ determines a Dirichlet symbol $\u03bb(\u03b8)$, and the corresponding heat spectral multipliers induce translation-invariant kernels and their reproducing-kernel Hilbert spaces. We obtain explicit global $W_1$-Lipschitz bounds for all functions in these spaces. Random Fourier feature maps are constructed by sampling from the heat measures; they are unbiased kernel approximations and satisfy asymptotic Lipschitz estimates based on the same spectral quantities.

    "abstract": "In coding theory, handling errors that occur when symbols are inserted or deleted from a transmitted message is a long-standing challenge. Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function.",

The main objective is to identify the critical plots for intervention, using the network connectivity and potential intervention constraints.\n  Using results from monotone systems theory, we first derive a sufficient condition guaranteeing the elimination of the wild population through SIT, which relies on the sign of the Perron value of a certain Metzler matrix. When an Allee effect is naturally present, releases are finite in time, and an upper bound of the control time is provided. We then formulate an optimisation problem aimed at minimising the total daily number of sterile insects released to ensure population elimination. We focus in particular on the oriental fruit fly, which significantly impacts mango orchards in La R\u00e9union.\n  Through numerical simulations, we illustrate our theoretical results and study different scenarios, including some where releases are limited to certain orchards. Indeed, when implementing SIT in the field, some owners may be reluctant to allow releases on their property. We also consider additional control by mass trapping, which can affect the sterile insects entering trapped areas, and show that although it increases the critical number of sterile insects to be released daily, it reduces the duration of the SIT program. Mass trapping may thus decrease the total number of sterile insects released over the entire elimination program.",

The so-called relaxed problem plays a central role within this context. Through a numerical example, it is shown why relying on the relaxed problem can lead the solution astray. As an alternative, an iterative Switching Time Optimization method is proposed. The method consists of two components that iteratively interact: a Switching Time Optimization (STO) problem and a sequence optimization. Each component is explained in detail, and the numerical example is resolved, the results of which shows the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of the method are discussed and future lines of research are sketched.",

This joint moduli space has many interesting structures that are preserved by the mapping class group of the surface. We describe a surprising relationship between four key objects: the isomonodromic foliation, a canonical hermitian form arising from the Atiyah-Bott-Goldman symplectic structure on the character variety, a canonical holomorphic form which vertically lifts vector fields on Teichm\u00fcller space, and the energy function for equivariant harmonic maps. One consequence of this work is the construction of pseudo-K\u00e4hler metrics on many examples of components of character varieties which include rank two higher Teichm\u00fcller spaces.

We extend some of these findings to the broader family of \u03b1-symmetric distributions, which includes both elliptically symmetric and multivariate heavy-tailed distributions. For location estimation, we establish an upper bound on the estimation error of the location halfspace median under the Huber contamination model. An analogous result for the standard scatter halfspace median matrix is feasible only under the assumption of elliptical symmetry, as ellipticity is deeply embedded in the definition of scatter halfspace depth. To address this limitation, we propose a modified scatter halfspace depth that better accommodates \u03b1-symmetric distributions, and derive an upper bound for the corresponding \u03b1-scatter median matrix. Additionally, we identify several key properties of scatter halfspace depth for \u03b1-symmetric distributions.",

We develop an abstract optimal recovery framework in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) for reconstructing unknown target functions from mixed equality and inequality functional constraints. Within this framework, the approximation of $v^*$ is cast as a collocation-type problem derived from verification conditions for optimality -- most prominently, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation -- that uniquely characterizes $v^*$. As the set of collocation points becomes dense in the ambient domain $\u03a9$, we establish convergence of the RKHS approximants to $v^*$: globally on $\u03a9$ in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is analytic, and locally (in a neighborhood of the origin) in the RKHS norm when $v^*$ is bounded from above and below by quadratic functions. Furthermore, we show that a practical numerical realization of the abstract scheme reduces to the classical policy iteration algorithm. Numerical experiments support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "In [arXiv:1405.6274, Question 5.2 & Question 5.3] Aschenbrenner, Friedl and Wilton ask: (1) Is the equation problem solvable for the fundamental group of any $3$-manifold? and (2) Is the first-order theory of the fundamental group of any $3$-manifold decidable? In this paper we answer both of these questions by proving that Hilbert's tenth problem over the integers can be encoded in equations over any non-virtually abelian fundamental group of any Seifert fibered 3-manifold whose orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. We use this to show that the equation problem (and hence also the first-order theory) is undecidable in this infinite family of $3$-manifold groups and then apply it to classify the Seifert 3-manifold groups with decidable equation problems and decidable first-order theories, in the case that the orbifold has non-negative Euler characteristic. In contrast, we show that for this class of Seifert 3-manifold groups the single equation problem is decidable. For every Seifert 3-manifold group $G$ where the orbifold has negative Euler characteristic we show that either $G$ has decidable equation problem or $G$ has a finite index subgroup of index $2$ that has decidable equation problem. These negative Euler characteristic results follow from work of Liang on central extensions of hyperbolic groups. We also discuss why Liang's results do not suffice to deal with all the negative Euler characteristic cases. We show how to construct several other infinite families of $3$-manifold groups with undecidable equation problem (and hence also undecidable first-order theory) including examples that are not Seifert manifold groups and examples that are not virtually nilpotent. In addition, we observe that there are numerous other infinite families for which the first-order theory is undecidable such as fundamental groups of manifolds modeled on 3-dimensional Sol geometry.",

We have studied the completeness of the spectrum in terms of the Bethe roots for small lattice sizes and have computed the eigenstate momenta. We found that the spins of the low-lying excitations can have fractional values in accordance with predictions of the underlying conformal field theory.

Generalized splines can also be understood via schemes, with the interpolation constraints -- or so-called GKM-condition -- encoded by gluing along certain closed subschemes. This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness.\n  We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension. As a special case, this implies every generalized spline module over $k[x,y]$ with principal edge labels is free.",

    "title": "Universality of AMP via Tree Pairings",
    "abstract": "We prove universality for Approximate Message Passing (AMP) with polynomial nonlinearities applied to symmetric sub-Gaussian matrices $A\\in\\mathbb R^{N\\times N}$. Our approach is combinatorial: we represent AMP iterates as sums over trees and define a Wick pairing algebra that counts the number of valid row-wise pairings of edges. The number of such pairings coincides with the trees contribution to the state evolution formulas. This algebra works for non-Gaussian entries. For polynomial nonlinearities of degree at most $D$, we show that the moments of AMP iterates match their state evolution predictions for $t \\lesssim \\frac{\\log N}{D\\log D}$ iterations. The proof controls all \"excess\" trees via explicit enumeration bounds, showing non \"Wick-paired\" contributions vanish in the large-$N$ limit. The same framework should apply, with some modifications, to spiked AMP and tensor AMP models.",

    "abstract": "Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is a two-dimensional modulation scheme designed in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, exhibiting superior performance over orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in environments with high Doppler frequency shifts. We investigated the channel estimation in the DD domain of OTFS systems, modeling it as a sparse signal recovery problem. Subsequently, within the existing sparse Bayesian learning framework, we proposed an adaptive Bayesian threshold-based active denoising mechanism. Combined with inverse-free sparse Bayesian learning, this effectively addresses the pseudo-peak issue in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios while maintaining low complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that this algorithm outperforms existing channel estimation algorithms in terms of anti-noise performance and complexity.",

    "abstract": "For any $k\\ge 3$ and $\\ell \\in [k-1]$ such that $(k,\\ell) \\ne (3,1)$, we show that any sufficiently large $k$-graph $G$ must contain a Hamilton $\\ell$-cycle provided that it has no isolated vertices and every set of $k-1$ vertices contained in an edge is contained in at least $\\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\lfloor{\\frac{k}{k-\\ell}\\rfloor}(k-\\ell)}\\right)n - (k - 3)$ edges. We also show that this bound is tight for infinitely many values of $k$ and $\\ell$ and is off by at most $1$ for all others, and is hence essentially optimal. This improves an asymptotic version of this result due to Mycroft and Z\u00e1rate-Guer\u00e9n, and the case $\\ell = k-1$ completely resolves a conjecture of Illingworth, Lang, M\u00fcyesser, Parczyk and Sgueglia.\n  These results support the utility of $\\textit{minimum}$ $\\textit{supported}$ $\\textit{co-degree}$ conditions in a $k$-graph, a recently introduced variant of the standard notion of minimum co-degree applicable to $k$-graphs with non-trivial strong independent sets. Our proof techniques involve a novel blow-up tiling framework introduced by Lang, avoiding traditional approaches using the regularity and blow-up lemmas.",

    "title": "Generalized Higman's Theorem and iterated ideals",
    "abstract": "Generalized Higman's Theorem is the direct counterpart of Higman's Theorem that asserts the closure of the class of \\emph{better} quasi-orders, instead of the class of \\emph{well} quasi-orders, under the construction $P\\mapsto P^{<\u03c9}$ of the embeddability order on finite sequences. Traditionally, this result is obtained as a consequence of very powerful and general techniques of Nash-Williams. In this paper, we propose a new proof of this result that is based on an explicit characterization of the underlying orders. In particular, this new technique allows us to formalize the proof of the result in the formal theory $\\mathsf{atr}_0$, thus resolving a long-standing open problem in the field of reverse mathematics.\n  The main ingredient of our proof is the introduction of a transfinite hierarchy of orders $\\dot I^*_\u03b1(P)$ starting with $\\dot I^*_0(P)=P$ and $\\dot I^*_{\u03b1+1}(P)$ being the inclusion order on ideals of $\\dot I^*_\u03b1(P)$. On one hand, we show that a quasi-order $P$ is a bqo if and only if all $\\dot I^*_\u03b1(P)$ are wqos. On the other hand, under the assumption that $P$ is a bqo, we show that the $\\dot I^*_\u03b1(P^{<\u03c9})$ are wqos, and furthermore give a characterization of their structure in terms of a transfinite iteration of a Higman-like construction. The sufficiently explicit character of this proof allows us to formalize it in a rather straightforward manner.",

Three of these had been conjectured by Flohr, Grabow, and Koehn, while special cases of two of the identities were first conjectured in 1993 by Kedem, Klassen, McCoy, and Melzer. Warnaar's proof relies on a multi-sum identity from Andrews' proof of the Andrews-Gordon identities. We give a new proof of all four identities using the theory of Bailey pairs. Furthermore, we establish a parametric generalization of two of the identities and provide two distinct proofs of this generalization.",

    "abstract": "Chifan-Ioana (2010) implies that, for any factor of IID percolation on any nonamenable Cayley graph $G$, there is a countable set of (strong) indistinguishability classes for non-hyperfinite clusters. We introduce quantitative strengthenings, called (qI) and (qSI): for $\u03b7$-non-hyperfinite clusters, there are at most $M(G,\u03b7)<\\infty$ (strong) indistinguishability classes, for any FIID percolation.\n  We first show that (qI) and (qSI) for any $G$ are equivalent to the ``sparse implies thin'' property (SiT): any FIID percolation with $\u03b7$-non-hyperfinite clusters has density at least $c(G,\u03b7)>0$. Also, (SiT) is independent of the finite generating set of a group. We prove, using entropy inequalities, that (SiT) holds for free groups, even for weak FIIDs. On the other hand, recent work of Jard\u00f3n-S\u00e1nchez, Mellick, Poulin, and Wr\u00f3bel implies that (SiT) fails for weak FIIDs on non-exact, i.e., not property (A) groups.\n  Furthermore, (SiT) implies that the Bernoulli graphing over any non-hyperfinite FIID cluster is strongly ergodic, and that indistinguishability for non-hyperfinite FIID clusters is equivalent to strong indistinguishability. These results follow from the work of Chifan-Ioana for every nonamenable Cayley graph, but with non-probabilistic proofs.\n  We also prove, again using entropy inequalities, this time for all nonamenable Cayley graphs, that any FIID percolation with high enough expected degree must have a density close to 1, and there must be a single indistinguishability class of such clusters. On Kazhdan groups, there must be a single such cluster.\n  Our results have finite counterparts: in any large girth $d$-regular graph sequence, any FIID subgraph of average degree at least $2+\u03b4$ must have density at least $c(d,\u03b4)>0$. In the uniform random d-regular graph $G_{n,d}$, this holds for every subgraph of average degree at least $2+\u03b4$.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we investigate optimal control of a Brinkman equation couple with sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard equation. The Cahn-Hilliard equation is endowed with a source term accounting for mass exchange and the velocity equation contains a non divergence-free forcing term, which act as distributed control variable. We consider the aforementioned system with constant mobility, viscosity and nonlinearity of double-well shape is regular. The cost functional of the optimal control problem contains a nondifferentiable term like the $L^1$-norm with sparsity constant $\u03ba$, which leads to sparsity of optimal controls. We study the first order necessary optimality condition for both the case $\u03ba=0$ and $\u03ba>0.$ When the cost functional is differentiable, first order necessary optimality conditions are characterized by Lagrange multiplier method and for nondifferentiable case we have used the idea of Casas and Tr\u00f6ltzsch from the paper (Math. control Relat. Fields, 10(3):527-546, 2020).",
