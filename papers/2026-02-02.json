    "title": "Convergence Analysis of the Discrete Constrained Saddle Dynamics and Their Momentum Variants",
    "abstract": "We study the discrete constrained saddle dynamics and their momentum variants for locating saddle points on manifolds. Under the assumption of exact unstable eigenvectors, we establish a local linear convergence of the discrete constrained saddle dynamics and show that the convergence rate depends on the condition number of the Riemannian Hessian. To mitigate this dependence, we introduce a momentum-based constrained saddle dynamics and prove local convergence of the continuous-time dynamics as well as the corresponding discrete scheme, which further demonstrates that momentum accelerates convergence, particularly in ill-conditioned settings. In addition, we show that a single-step eigenvector update is sufficient to guarantee local convergence; thus, the assumption of exact unstable eigenvectors is not necessary, which substantially reduces the computational cost. Finally, numerical experiments, including applications to the Thomson problem, the Rayleigh quotient on the Stiefel manifold, and the energy functional of Bose-Einstein condensates, are presented to complement the theoretical analysis.",

This solution preserves upper and lower bounds of the densities, and shows a certain decay of the BV norm (of the order of $t^{-1/3}$ for $t\\to 0$ -- if $\u03c1_0\\notin BV$, otherwise the BV norm is of course bounded -- and of the order of $t^{-1}$ as $t\\to\\infty$). This generalizes a previous result by Carlier and Poon, who only gave a full proof in one dimension of space and did not consider the case $\u03c1_0\\notin BV$.\n  The main tool consists in considering an approximated TV-JKO scheme which artificially imposes a lower bound on the density and allows to find a continuous-in-time solution regular enough to prove that the lower bounds of the initial datum propagates in time, and study on this approximated equation the decay of the BV norm.",

    "abstract": "We establish the first unconditional well-posedness result for the master equation associated with a general class of mean field games of controls. Our analysis covers games with displacement monotone or Lasry--Lions monotone data, as well as those with a small time horizon. By unconditional, we mean that all assumptions are imposed solely at the level of the Lagrangian and the terminal cost. In particular, we do not require any a priori regularity or structural assumptions on the additional fixed-point mappings arising from the control interactions; instead we show that these fixed-point mappings are well-behaved as a consequence of the regularity and the monotonicity of the data. Our approach is bottom-up in nature, unlike most previous results which rely on a generalized method of characteristics. In particular, we build a classical solution of the master equation by showing that the solutions of the corresponding $N$-player Nash systems are compact, in an appropriate sense, and that their subsequential limit points must be solutions to the master equation. Compactness is obtained via uniform-in-$N$ decay estimates for derivatives of the $N$-player value functions. The underlying games are driven by non-degenerate idiosyncratic Brownian noise, and our results allow for the presence of common noise with constant intensity.",

    "abstract": "Conformal prediction (CP) is a distribution-free method to construct reliable prediction intervals that has gained significant attention in recent years. Despite its success and various proposed extensions, a significant practical feature which has been overlooked in previous research is the potential skewed nature of the noise, or of the residuals when the predictive model exhibits bias. In this work, we leverage recent developments in CP to propose a new asymmetric procedure that bridges the gap between skewed and non-skewed noise distributions, while still maintaining adaptivity of the prediction intervals. We introduce a new statistical learning problem to construct adaptive and asymmetric prediction bands, with a unique feature based on a penalty which promotes symmetry: when its intensity varies, the intervals smoothly change from symmetric to asymmetric ones. This learning problem is based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and the recently introduced kernel sum-of-squares framework. First, we establish representer theorems to make our problem tractable in practice, and derive dual formulations which are essential for scalability to larger datasets. Second, the intensity of the penalty is chosen using a novel data-driven method which automatically identifies the symmetric nature of the noise. We show that consenting to some asymmetry can let the learned prediction bands better adapt to small sample regimes or biased predictive models.",

For a generic stable discretization of $X$ in terms of a dense sequence $(V_m)_{m \\in \\mathbb{N}_0}$ of finite-dimensional subspaces, we obtain fully-discrete, linear approximations in terms of so-called sparse-grid tensor-product projectors, with convergence rates of approximations as well as of sparse-grid tensor-product quadratures of the target functions.\n  We verify the abstract assumptions in two fundamental application settings: first, a linear elliptic diffusion equation with affine-parametric coefficients and second, abstract holomorphic maps between separable Hilbert spaces with affine-parametric input data encoding. For these settings, as in [37,20], cancellation of anti-symmetric terms in ultra-spherical Jacobi generalized polynomial chaos expansion coefficients implies crucially improved convergence rates of sparse-grid tensor-product quadrature with respect to the infinite-tensor-product Jacobi weight, free from the ``curse-of-dimension\".\n  Largely self-contained proofs of all results are developed.

To address two central challenges -- slow progress in flat energy landscapes, which can trigger premature stagnation at suboptimal configurations, and mesh deterioration during geometric evolution -- we couple a second-order inertial flow with a minimal-deformation-rate (MDR) mesh motion strategy. This coupling accelerates convergence while preserving mesh quality and thus avoids remeshing. To further enhance robustness for non-smooth or non-convex initial geometries, we incorporate surface-diffusion regularization within the Barrett-Garcke-N\"urnberg (BGN) framework. Moreover, we extend the inertial MDR methodology to Willmore-type surface hole filling, enabling high-order smooth reconstructions even from incompatible initial data. Numerical experiments demonstrate markedly faster convergence to lower original objective values, together with consistently superior mesh preservation throughout the evolution.",

Under the high-dimensional setting, most of the existing research has focused on identifying change points in historical data. However, there is a significant lack of studies on the practically relevant online change point problem, which means promptly detecting change points as they occur. In this paper, applying the limiting theory of linear spectral statistics for random matrices, we propose a class of spectrum based CUSUM-type statistic. We first construct a martingale from the difference of linear spectral statistics of sequential sample Fisher matrices, which converges to a Brownian motion. Our CUSUM-type statistic is then defined as the maximum of a variant of this process. Finally, we develop our detection procedure based on the invariance principle. Simulation results show that our detection method is highly sensitive to the occurrence of change point and is able to identify it shortly after they arise, outperforming the existing approaches.",

Bernoulli sensing and communication links, under a finite-horizon linear-quadratic-Gaussian cost, we rigorously characterise the optimal policies through an uncertainty-aware synthesis. We establish that the optimal switching policy, for the ISAC system at the base station, is threshold-based in terms of the source and base-station estimation covariances, while the optimal control policy, for the actuator at the source, is linear in the source state estimate.

We consider an ISAC-enabled base station that can sense the state of a remote source and communicate this information back to the source. Both sensing and communication succeed with given probabilities and incur distinct costs. The objective is to optimise a long-term cost that captures information freshness, measured by the age of information (AoI), at the source together with sensing and communication overheads. The resulting sequential decision problem is formulated as a discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision process with a two-dimensional AoI state, representing information freshness at the source and at the base station. We prove that the optimal stationary policy admits a monotone threshold structure characterised by a nondecreasing switching curve in the AoI state space. Our numerical analysis illustrates the structures of the value function and the optimal decision map. These results demonstrate that freshness-based objectives can be naturally integrated into ISAC design, while yielding interpretable and implementable strategies.",

The ants process relies on a reinforcement learning mechanism. In this paper, we modify the ants process by having more than one ants nest (and still one source of food). For technical reasons, we restrict ourselves to the case when there are two nests, and when the graph is a triangle between the two nests and the source of food, whose edges have been replaced by series-parallel graphs.

This paper proposes a new list decoding for extended RS (eRS) codes defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^n}. It is developed based on transforming an eRS code into n binary polar codes. Consequently, it can be decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding and further their list decoding, i.e., the SCL decoding. A pre-transformed matrix is required for reinterpretating the eRS codes, which also determines their SC and SCL decoding performances. Its column linear independence property is studied, leading to theoretical characterization of their SC decoding performance. Our proposed decoding and analysis are validated numerically.",

Under a Boolean approximation of block fading, DivE derives a Boolean fading function for each variable node (VN) output (i.e., the a-posteriori reliability after iterative decoding), from which the VN diversity order can be directly determined. Building on this insight, we develop a greedy blockmapping search that assigns protograph VNs to fading blocks so that all information VNs achieve full diversity, while including the minimum additional parity VNs when full diversity is infeasible at the nominal rate. Numerical results on the 5G New Radio LDPC codes show that the proposed search finds block mappings that guarantee full diversity for all information bits without modifying the base-graph structure, yielding a markedly steeper high-SNR slope and lower BLER than random mappings.",

These metrics are non-smooth and non-convex, so off-the-shelf optimization algorithms can only guarantee convergence to Clarke critical points. To address this, the proposed Normalized Descent algorithm leverages the structure of non-smooth points in visibility problems and introduces randomness to escape saddle points. Our technical analysis allows for the non-monotonic decrease in the visibility metric and strengthens the algorithm guarantees, ensuring convergence to local minima with high probability.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we completely describe the family of integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\\mathbb{Q}[X]$. We accomplish this result by classifying the Krull domains between these two polynomial rings. To this end, we first describe the DVRs of $\\mathbb{Q}(X)$ lying over $\\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ for some prime $p \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, by distinguishing them according to whether the extension of the residue fields is algebraic or transcendental. We unify the known descriptions of such valuations by considering ultrametric balls in $\\mathbb{C}_p$, the completion of the algebraic closure of the field $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers. We then study when the intersection $R$ of such DVRs with $\\mathbb{Q}[X]$ is of finite character, so that $R$ is a Krull domain, and we finally compute the divisor class group of $R$. It turns out that such a ring is formed by those polynomials which simultaneously map a finite union of ultrametric balls of $\\mathbb{C}_p$ to its valuation domain $\\mathbb{O}_p$, as $p\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ ranges through the set of primes. By a result of Heinzer, the Krull domains of this class are precisely the integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\\mathbb{Q}[X]$. This novel approach provides a geometric understanding of this class of integrally closed domains. Furthermore, we also describe the UFDs between $\\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\\mathbb{Q}[X]$.",

We then exploit these structural results to characterize, from a metaplectic perspective, classes of time-frequency representations satisfying prescribed structural properties. Finally, we discuss further implications for parabolic equations with complex quadratic Hamiltonians, we study the boundedness of their propagators on modulation spaces, we obtain estimates in time of their operator norms. Finally, we apply our theory to the study of propagation of Wigner singularities.",

Moreover, under the k-reducibility assumption, the computation of the homology self-closeness number of the wedge sum of spaces essentially reduces to the computation of the homology self-closeness numbers of the individual wedge summands. We generalize the notion of an atomic space to that of an $n$-atomic space and establish some of its fundamental properties.

In this paper we examine techniques to accelerate the application of DMD to large-scale data sets with an eye on randomized techniques. Randomized techniques exploit low-rank matrix approximations at a much smaller computational cost, therefore permitting the use of increased data set sizes. In particular, we propose the application of the RPCholesky algorithm in the setting of kernelized DMD (KDMD). This algorithm relies on adaptive randomized sampling to approximate positive semidefinite kernel matrices and provides better stability guarantees than previously implemented randomized methods for KDMD. Differences between existing competitive randomized techniques and our proposed implementation are discussed with a focus on numerical stability and tradeoff between exploration and exploitation of information obtained from data. The efficacy of this new combination of algorithms is demonstrated on well-established benchmark problems from DMD literature increasing in problem dimension.",

It is a phase-field model that combines the Cahn-Hilliard regularized interface equation and Biot's equations of poroelasticity. Solving the system poses significant challenges due to its coupled, nonlinear, and non-convex nature. The main goal of this work is to provide a consistent and efficient solution strategy. With this in mind, we introduce a semi-implicit time discretization such that the resulting discrete system is equivalent to a convex minimization problem. Then, using abstract theory for convex problems, we prove the convergence of an alternating minimization method to the time-discrete system. The solution strategy is relatively flexible in terms of spatial discretization, although we require standard inverse inequalities for the guaranteed convergence of the alternating minimization method. Finally, we perform some numerical experiments that show the promise of the proposed solution strategy, both in terms of efficiency and robustness.",

However, most functions lack closed-form proximal operators, which has long restricted these methods to a narrow set of problems. Hamilton-Jacobi-based proximal operator (HJ-Prox) is a recent derivative-free Monte Carlo technique based on Hamilton-Jacobi PDE theory, that approximates proximal operators numerically. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for operator splitting via HJ-Prox, which allows for deployment of operator splitting even when functions are not proximable. We prove that replacing exact proximal steps with HJ-Prox in algorithms such as proximal point, proximal gradient descent, Douglas-Rachford splitting, Davis-Yin splitting, and primal-dual hybrid gradient preserves convergence guarantees under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments demonstrate HJ-Prox is competitive and effective on a wide variety of statistical learning tasks.",

In this work, we study quaternionic perfect sequences having a one-to-one correspondence with the binary sequences arising in Williamson's construction of quaternion-type Hadamard matrices. Using this correspondence, we devise an enumeration algorithm that is significantly faster than previously used algorithms and does not require the sequences to be symmetric. We implement our algorithm and use it to enumerate all circulant and possibly non-symmetric Williamson-type matrices of orders up to 21; previously, the largest order exhaustively enumerated was 13. We prove that when the blocks of a quaternion-type Hadamard matrix are circulant, the blocks are necessarily pairwise amicable. This dramatically improves the filtering power of our algorithm: in order 20, the number of block pairs needing consideration is reduced by a factor of over 25,000. We use our results to construct quaternionic Hadamard matrices of interest in quantum communication and prove they are not equivalent to those constructed by other means. We also study the properties of quaternionic Hadamard matrices analytically, and demonstrate the feasibility of characterizing quaternionic Hadamard matrices with a fixed pattern of entries. These results indicate a richer set of properties and suggest an abundance of quaternionic Hadamard matrices for sufficiently large orders.",

In the analogous case when $f$ is a continuous $N^{1,p}$ map from $[0,1]^n$ into a metric space, we show that the image $f([0,1]^n)$ has a unique metric tangent (Gromov-Hausdorff convergence) almost everywhere.

We propose a multilevel Monte Carlo gradient estimator whose bias decays as $O(T_{n}^{-1} )$ while its expected computational cost grows only as $O(log T_n )$, where $T_n$ is the maximal truncation level at iteration n. Building on this approach, we introduce a multilevel MCMC framework for adaptive stochastic gradient methods, leading to new multilevel variants of Adagrad and AMSGrad algorithms. Under conditions controlling the estimator bias and its second and third moments, we establish a convergence rate of order $O(n^{-1/2} )$ up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we illustrate these results on Importance-Weighted Autoencoders trained with the proposed multilevel adaptive methods.",

While these approaches are of independent interest, the aim of this work is to apply them to global optimization. Our framework applies generically to any method that can be formulated as a MKV system.

    "abstract": "Rydberg-based Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimation has been hampered by the complexity of receiver arrays and the single-target, narrow-band limitations of existing single-receiver methods. This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses these limitations. We demonstrate that by spatially resolving the fluorescence profile along the vapor cell, the multi-target problem can be effectively solved. Our approach hinges on the insight that by superimposing incoming signals with a strong local oscillator (LO), the complex atomic absorption pattern is linearized into a simple superposition of sinusoids. In this new representation, each spatial frequency uniquely and directly maps to the DoA of a target. This reduces the multi-target challenge into a spectral estimation problem, which we address using Prony's method. Our approach, termed Imaging-based Spectral Estimation (ISE), inherently supports multi-target detection and restores the full broadband capability of the sensor by removing the restrictive cell-length dependency. This development also shows potential for realizing multi-channel Rydberg receivers and the continuous-aperture sensing required for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). We develop a comprehensive theoretical model, derive the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) as a performance benchmark, and present simulations validating the effectiveness of the approach to resolve multiple targets.",

It admits an energy-dissipation law and, under suitable assumptions, bounded solutions. Many structure-preserving numerical schemes have been proposed to retain such properties; however, existing approaches are often fully implicit and therefore computationally expensive. We introduce a simple design principle for constructing dissipation-preserving finite difference schemes and apply it to the Swift--Hohenberg equation in three spatial dimensions. Our analysis relies on discrete inequalities for the underlying energy, assuming a Lipschitz continuous gradient and either convexity or $\u03bc$-strong convexity of the relevant terms. The resulting method is linearly implicit, yet it preserves the original energy-dissipation law, guarantees unique solvability, ensures boundedness of numerical solutions, and admits an a priori error estimate, provided that the time step is sufficiently small. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first linearly implicit finite difference scheme for the Swift--Hohenberg equation for which all of these properties are established.",

The formulation of this counting problem leads to a universal construction which assigns to any poset a finitely cocomplete additive category; it is abelian when the poset is finite and does not depend on the choice of any ring of coefficients. For a general poset the universal category of representations is abelian if and only if for the lattice of ideals the meet of two compact elements is again compact.",

Considering an equivalence relation on $B_n$ posets, where two posets are equivalent if they share the same set of type-$B$ linear extensions, we identify a natural representative of each equivalence class, which we call a distinguished poset. We further characterize the distinguished posets whose sets of type-$B$ linear extensions form intervals in the right weak Bruhat order on the the hyperoctahedral groups. Finally, we discuss the relationship among the categories associated to type-$B$ weak Bruhat interval modules, $B_n$ poset modules, and finite-dimensional $H_n^B(0)$-modules.",

In industry-scale active learning settings, where generating a single high-fidelity simulation may require days or weeks of computation and produce data volumes on the order of gigabytes, they quickly become impractical. This paper proposes a scalable and reliable Bayesian surrogate model, termed the Bayesian Interpolating Neural Network (B-INN). The B-INN combines high-order interpolation theory with tensor decomposition and alternating direction algorithm to enable effective dimensionality reduction without compromising predictive accuracy. We theoretically show that the function space of a B-INN is a subset of that of Gaussian processes, while its Bayesian inference exhibits linear complexity, $\\mathcal{O}(N)$, with respect to the number of training samples. Numerical experiments demonstrate that B-INNs can be from 20 times to 10,000 times faster with a robust uncertainty estimation compared to Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes. These capabilities make B-INN a practical foundation for uncertainty-driven active learning in large-scale industrial simulations, where computational efficiency and robust uncertainty calibration are paramount.",

A rigorous system framework incorporating realistic 3GPP Tapped Delay Line (TDL) channel models is established to accurately capture high-mobility propagation characteristics. To counteract channel aging effects while maintaining low computational complexity, an SNR-aware flexible FTN strategy is introduced, wherein a low-complexity Look-Up Table (LUT) is utilized to adaptively optimize the time-domain compression factor based on instantaneous channel responses. Through this mechanism, the trade-off between rate acceleration and interference penalty is effectively resolved, ensuring that spectral efficiency is maximized while strict reliability constraints are satisfied with minimal processing overhead. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis is provided, in which analytical expressions for effective throughput, energy efficiency, and bit error rate are derived. Finally, it is demonstrated by extensive simulations that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms static FTN benchmarks, offering a superior balance of high throughput and robustness for next-generation LEO communications.",

This presents new possibilities for composers interested in the serial method, given the fact that the variety of intervals obtained by this method is far greater than that of classic serialism. In this manuscript, we will study some unexplored possibilities that the proliferating series offer from a mathematical point of view, which will allow composers to gain much more familiarity with them and potentially result in the creation of pieces that take serialism to the next level.",

However, scale-free noises, whose spectra scale as a non-integer power of frequency, are ubiquitous in practice. We establish a method, together with performance guarantees, that solves the forecasting problem in the presence of scale-free noise.

To do it, we first linearize the nonlinear equation around the steady state. The linearized system turns out to be a system coupled between second order and fourth order parabolic equations and the control acts in the fourth order parabolic equation. The null controllability of the linearized system is obtained by a duality argument proving an observability inequality. To prove the observability inequality, a new Carleman inequality for the coupled system is derived. Next, using the source term method, it is shown that the null controllability of the linearized system with non-homogeneous terms persists provided the non-homogeneous terms satisfy certain estimates in a suitable weighted space. Finally, using a Banach fixed point theorem in a suitable weighted space, the local controllability of the nonlinear system is obtained.",

The state equations of the followers interact through graphon coupling terms, with their diffusion coefficients depending on the state, the graphon aggregation term, and the control variables. The diffusion term of the leader's state equation depends on its state and control variables. Within this framework, a hierarchical decision-making structure is established: for any strategy adopted by the leader, the followers compete to attain a Nash equilibrium, while the leader optimizes its own cost functional by anticipating the followers' equilibrium response. This work develops a rigorous mathematical model for the game, proves the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the system's state equations under admissible control sets, and constructs a Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium for the continuum follower game. By employing the continuity method, we establish the existence, uniqueness, and stability of solutions to the associated forward-backward stochastic differential equation with a graphon aggregation term.",

Classical solutions, such as those proposed by Gringarten et al. 1975, rely on simplified assumptions and systematically overestimate thermal performance, which can lead to unrealistic engineering decisions.\n  This study presents a generalized analytical model for enhanced geothermal systems that explicitly captures thermal interactions between fractures while preserving analytical tractability.\n  The formulation is based on Green\u015b functions and reproduces realistic thermal behavior under conditions representative of fractured geothermal reservoirs. The resulting solution is computationally efficient and sufficiently simple to be implemented directly in standard spreadsheets, without requiring Laplace space transformations or numerical inversion algorithms.\n  The model is validated against numerical simulations performed using CMG STARS and Volsung software, showing close agreement in temperature evolution, including the effects of interacting fractures. Compared with classical analytical approaches, the proposed model corrects optimistic bias and provides more reliable predictions of production temperature and energy recovery.\n  These results have direct implications for geothermal feasibility studies, well design, and power forecasting, effectively bridging the gap between legacy analytical models and numerical or commercial engineering tools. Building on the analytical framework originally introduced by Gringarten et al. 1975, the proposed formulation generalizes classical heat transfer solutions to account for fracture interaction while retaining analytical simplicity and practical applicability.",

However, existing static policies fail to address a fundamental tension: algorithms suffer from stochastic ``reliability drift,'' while human override capacity is scarce and congestible. We formulate the management of such systems as a dynamic queueing control problem. The system state is defined by the tuple (queue backlog, reliability regime), and the control variable is a state-dependent risk threshold. We prove that the optimal escalation policy is driven by the endogenous ``Shadow Price of Capacity.'' We establish two key structural monotonicity results: (i) Congestion Shedding, where the threshold rises with backlog to sacrifice marginal accuracy for responsiveness; and (ii) Safety Buffering, where the threshold lowers during drift to use the queue as a ``risk capacitor.'' Furthermore, we identify a critical ``Capacity Phase Transition'' in the arrival-drift parameter space, beyond which no policy can maintain safety standards without causing structural system failure (infinite queues). Our results provide rigorous operational rules for managing the interface between imperfect algorithms and congested experts.",

    "abstract": "Covariance steering (CS) synthesizes a control policy which drives the state's mean and covariance matrix towards desired values. Offering tractable computation of a closed-loop policy which can obey chance constraints in uncertain environments, application to many real-world control problems have been proposed. We consider the chance-constrained, discrete-time, linear time-varying CS with Gaussian noise. The contribution of this paper is a novel solution method for this problem, explicitly writing the propagation equations of the Cholesky factor of the state covariance matrix by using the QR decomposition. The use of the square-root form of covariance matrices brings two key benefits over other existing methods: (i) computational scalability and (ii) numerical reliability. (i) Compared to solution methods that require large block matrix formulations, the proposed method scales better with the growth in horizon length, shows better optimality, and uses memoryless state feedback. (ii) Compared to another class of methods that explicitly define the covariance matrix as variables, the proposed method allows flexible cost formulations and shows better numerical reliability when uncertainty terms are smaller than the mean. On the other hand, these benefits come with a minor drawback: the propagation equation of covariance square roots is non-convex, necessitating sequential convex programming to solve. However, this paper proves the global optimality of the proposed approach for CS without chance constraints. When chance constraints are present, the existing optimal CS formulation is also non-convex, and we prove that the proposed approach shares the same local minima. We verify the mathematical arguments via extensive numerical simulations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a highly parallel and derivative-free fractional neural walk-on-spheres method (FNWoS) for solving high-dimensional fractional Poisson equations on irregular domains. We first propose a simplified fractional walk-on-spheres (FWoS) scheme that replaces the high-dimensional normalized weight integral with a constant weight and adopts a correspondingly simpler sampling density, substantially reducing per-trajectory cost. To mitigate the slow convergence of standard Monte Carlo sampling, FNWoS is then proposed via integrating this simplified FWoS estimator, derived from the Feynman-Kac representation, with a neural network surrogate. By amortizing sampling effort over the entire domain during training, FNWoS achieves more accurate evaluation at arbitrary query points with dramatically fewer trajectories than classical FWoS. To further enhance efficiency in regimes where the fractional order $\u03b1$ is close to 2 and trajectories become excessively long, we introduce a truncated path strategy with a prescribed maximum step count. Building on this, we propose a buffered supervision mechanism that caches training pairs and progressively refines their Monte Carlo targets during training, removing the need to precompute a highly accurate training set and yielding the buffered fractional neural walk-on-spheres method (BFNWoS). Extensive numerical experiments, including tests on irregular domains and problems with dimensions up to $1000$, demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency of the proposed methods.",

To close a Duhamel fixed-point argument, we need uniform $L^1$ bounds for the associated half-line biharmonic heat kernel.

A key insight is that the underlying surface can be implicitly represented as a zero level set, allowing us to formulate a constraint minimization problem. We employ the primal-dual methodology, along with regularization and acceleration techniques, to develop our algorithm. This approach is robust, efficient, and easy to implement.

This scheme can fail with KM even in low-complexity first-order instances $\\varphi$ and even when only a set of indices $x$ are relevant. For closely related reasons, (ii) the theory KM does not prove the \u0141o\u015b theorem scheme for internal second-order ultrapowers, even for large cardinal ultrapowers, such as the ultrapower by a normal measure on a measurable cardinal. Indeed, the theory KM itself is not generally preserved by internal ultrapowers. Finally, (iii) KM does not prove that the $\u03a3^1_n$ logical complexity is invariant under first-order quantifiers, even bounded first-order quantifiers. For example, $\\forall \u03b1{<}\u03b4 \u03c8(\u03b1,X)$ is not always provably equivalent to a $\u03a3^1_1$ assertion when $\u03c8$ is.

    "abstract": "Sensing privacy and communication confidentiality play fundamentally different but interconnected roles in adversarial wireless environments. Capturing this interplay within a single physical-layer framework is particularly challenging in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the same waveform simultaneously serves dual purposes. We study a secure ISAC system in which a monostatic transmitter simultaneously sends a confidential message to a legitimate receiver and senses an environmental state, while a passive adversary attempts both message decoding and state estimation. We partially characterize the fundamental trade-offs among three performance measures: the transmitter's secrecy rate, its detection exponent, and the adversary's detection exponent. Beyond the joint input distribution that governs overall performance, the trade-offs are further shaped by the transmitter's ability to extract keys via feedback and hide both the content and structure of the codewords via wiretap and resolvability codes. We derive an achievable region, and illustrate the resulting design trade-offs through a numerical example.",

By the Lyapunov function approach, we show that the convergence properties of the proposed dynamical system depend on the choice of the Tikhonov regularization parameter. Specifically, when the Tikhonov regularization parameter tends to zero rapidly, the convergence rate of the primal-dual gap along the generated trajectory is O(1 over t squared times beta(t)); when the Tikhonov regularization parameter tends to zero slowly, the convergence rate of the primal-dual gap is o(1 over beta(t)). We also prove the strong convergence property of the trajectory generated by the Tikhonov regularized dynamical system to the minimum-norm solution of the convex-concave bilinear saddle point problem, and derive several integral estimates.

For the straight line model, this point is known to be an eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity, and we provide a detailed analysis of the corresponding eigenfunctions. By contrast, in the case of a circle, we show that the said point is not itself an eigenvalue, but rather an accumulation point of a double sequence of simple eigenvalues. In view of the high degree of symmetry of the configurations under analysis, this behavior is unexpected and our findings lead us to formulate some conjectures concerning critical singular interactions supported on generic smooth curves.",

The linearized Euler operator at this steady state possesses different invariant subspaces, within which we apply our criterion to rule out or detect instabilities. We show linear stability of odd perturbations, for which the unstable spectrum can appear only on the real axis. We exclude this possibility by applying our stability criterion. Real instabilities, instead, exist and can be detected with the same criterion if we consider suitable rescalings of the Taylor-Green vortex. In the subspace of functions even in both variables, the problem is reduced to finding a single complex root of our stability function. We successfully locate this value by combining our general criterion with a rigorous computer-assisted argument.

While adaptive step-size methods (like Armijo line-search) have revolutionized convex minimization, their application to this setting is hindered by the Stochasticity Barrier: the noise in gradient estimation masks the true operator curvature, triggering erroneously large steps that destabilize convergence. In this work, we propose VR-SDA-A (Variance-Reduced Stochastic Descent-Ascent with Armijo), a novel algorithm that integrates recursive momentum (STORM) with a rigorous Same-Batch Curvature Verification mechanism. We introduce a theoretical framework based on a Lyapunov potential tracking the Operator Norm, proving that VR- SDA-A achieves an oracle complexity of O(epsilon -3) for finding an epsilon-stationary point in general Lipschitz continuous operators. This matches the optimal rate for non-convex minimization while uniquely enabling automated step-size adaptation in the saddle-point setting. We validate our approach on canonical rotational benchmarks and non-convex robust regression tasks, demonstrating that our method effectively suppresses limit cycles and accelerates convergence with reduced dependence on manual learning rate scheduling.",

The methodology targets the efficient approximation of the relationship between optimized geometries and their corresponding mechanical responses or Quantity of Interest (QoI), with a particular focus on compliance-minimized linear elastic structures. High-dimensional TO results are first compressed using RRAEs, which encode the data into a low-rank approximation via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), obtained in this sense the most important features that approximate the data. Separate RRAE models are trained for geometry and for different types of QoIs, including scalar metrics, one-dimensional stress fields, and full two-dimensional von Mises stress distributions. The resulting low-dimensional latent coefficients of the latent space are then related through multilayer perceptrons to address both direct problems -- predicting structural responses from geometry -- and inverse problems -- recovering geometries from prescribed performance targets. The proposed approach is demonstrated on a benchmark TO problem based on a half MBB beam, using datasets generated via density-based Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) optimization. Numerical results show that the framework enables accurate and computationally efficient surrogate models, with increasing robustness and fidelity as richer QoIs are considered. The methodology also provides a foundation for generative mechanical design by enabling the synthesis of new geometries and responses through latent-space exploration.",

This work extends the graphon-based framework for IPS, used to derive continuum and mean-field limits in the non-exchangeable setting, to situations where the spatial domain is fractal rather than Euclidean. The motivation arises from both physical models naturally formulated on fractals and real-world networks exhibiting hierarchical or quasi-self-similar structure.\n  Our analysis relies on tools from fractal geometry, including Iterated Function Systems and self-similar measures. A central result is an explicit isomorphism between self-similar IPS and graphon IPS, which allows us to justify the continuum and mean-field limits in the self-similar setting. This connection reveals that macroscopic dynamics on fractal domains emerge naturally as limits of dynamics on appropriate discretizations of fractal sets.\n  Another contribution of the paper is the derivation of optimal convergence rates for the discrete self-similar models. We introduce a scale of generalized Lipschitz spaces on fractals, extending the Nikolskii-Besov spaces used in the Euclidean setting, and obtain convergence estimates for discontinuous Galerkin approximations of nonlocal equations posed on fractal domains. These results apply to kernels with minimal regularity addressing models relevant in applications.",

We introduce Semi-knockoffs, a CIT method that can accommodate any pre-trained model, avoids this split, and provides valid p-values and false discovery rate (FDR) control for high-dimensional settings. Unlike methods that rely on the model-$X$ assumption (known input distribution), Semi-knockoffs only require conditional expectations for continuous variables. This makes the procedure less restrictive and more practical for machine learning integration. To ensure validity when estimating these expectations, we present two new theoretical results of independent interest: (i) stability for regularized models trained with a null feature and (ii) the double-robustness property.",

Kcakol and S\u00e1nchez Ruiz proved that every sequentially complete Fr\u00e9chet--Urysohn locally convex space (lcs) is Baire. Being motivated by the property $(K)$ and the notion of a Mackey null sequence we introduce a property $(MK)$ which is strictly weaker than the property $(K)$, and show that any locally complete lcs has the property $(MK)$. We prove that any $\u03ba$-Fr\u00e9chet--Urysohn tvs with the property $(MK)$ is a Baire space; consequently, each locally complete $\u03ba$-Fr\u00e9chet--Urysohn lcs is a Baire space.

We answer two questions posed by Stiebitz et al. regarding the characterization of graphs which achieve Steffen's bound.

    "title": "Theoretical Challenges in Learning for Branch-and-Cut",
    "abstract": "Machine learning is increasingly used to guide branch-and-cut (B&C) for mixed-integer linear programming by learning score-based policies for selecting branching variables and cutting planes. Many approaches train on local signals from lookahead heuristics such as strong branching, and linear programming (LP) bound improvement for cut selection. Training and evaluation of the learned models often focus on local score accuracy. We show that such local score-based methods can lead to search trees exponentially larger than optimal tree sizes, by identifying two sources of this gap. The first is that these widely used expert signals can be misaligned with overall tree size. LP bound improvement can select a root cut set that yields an exponentially larger strong branching tree than selecting cuts by a simple proxy score, and strong branching itself can be exponentially suboptimal (Dey et al., 2024). The second is that small discrepancies can be amplified by the branch-and-bound recursion. An arbitrarily small perturbation of the right-hand sides in a root cut set can change the minimum tree size from a single node to exponentially many. For branching, arbitrarily small score discrepancies, and differences only in tie-breaking, can produce trees of exponentially different sizes, and even a small number of decision differences along a trajectory can incur exponential growth. These results show that branch-and-cut policies trained and learned using local expert scores do not guarantee small trees, thus motivating the study of data-driven methods that produce policies better aligned with tree size rather than only accuracy on expert scores.",

This approach, which we call the \"Geometric Quantization by Paths\" (GQbP) framework, replaces the traditional construction of principal bundles with the distillation of the space of histories. In this third part, we cross the \"Threshold of Analysis\" by constructing the intrinsic observable algebra of the system. The harmonic oscillator is treated here as a validation case, demonstrating that the standard resolution via complex polarization and half-forms is naturally integrated into the GQbP framework. Starting from the complexified groupoid, we define the algebra using symplectic half-densities to ensure a canonical convolution product. We then show that the transition to a polarized representation forces a factorization of these densities. The action of the symmetry group on the polarized half-forms generates a divergence term, which we identify as the source of the zero-point energy of the harmonic oscillator, $E_0 = n\\hbar/2$. This derivation resolves the \"Metaplectic Anomaly\" as a necessary geometric consequence of the intrinsic quantization process.",

Under a natural set of operational axioms, the most general form of entropy is captured by the family of R\u00e9nyi entropies, parameterized by a real number $\u03b1$. Conditional entropy extends the notion of entropy by quantifying uncertainty from the viewpoint of an observer with access to potentially correlated side information. However, despite their significance and the emergence of various useful definitions, a complete characterization of measures of conditional entropy that satisfy a natural set of operational axioms has remained elusive. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of conditional entropy, defined through a set of axioms that are essential for any operationally meaningful definition: additivity for independent random variables, invariance under relabeling, and monotonicity under conditional mixing channels. We prove that the most general form of conditional entropy is captured by a family of measures that are exponential averages of R\u00e9nyi entropies of the conditioned distribution and parameterized by a real parameter and a probability measure on the positive reals. Finally, we show that these quantities determine the rate of transformation under conditional mixing and provide a set of second laws of quantum thermodynamics with side information for states diagonal in the energy eigenbasis.",
