    "title": "Fisher-Information-Based Sensor Placement for Structural Digital Twins: Analytic Results and Benchmarks",
    "abstract": "High-fidelity digital twins rely on the accurate assimilation of sensor data into physics-based computational models. In structural applications, such twins aim to identify spatially distributed quantities--such as elementwise weakening fields, material parameters, or effective thermal loads--by minimizing discrepancies between measured and simulated responses subject to the governing equations of structural mechanics. While adjoint-based methods enable efficient gradient computation for these inverse problems, the quality and stability of the resulting estimates depend critically on the choice of sensor locations, measurement types, and directions.\n  This paper develops a rigorous and implementation-ready framework for Fisher-information-based sensor placement in adjoint-based finite-element digital twins. Sensor configurations are evaluated using a D-optimal design criterion derived from a linearization of the measurement map, yielding a statistically meaningful measure of information content. We present matrix-free operator formulas for applying the Jacobian and its adjoint, and hence for computing Fisher-information products $Fv = J^\\top R^{-1} Jv$ using only forward and adjoint solves. Building on these operator evaluations, we derive explicit sensitivity expressions for D-optimal sensor design with respect to measurement parameters and discuss practical strategies for evaluating the associated log-determinant objectives. To complement the general framework, we provide analytically tractable sensor placement results for a canonical one-dimensional structural model, clarifying the distinction between detectability and localizability and proving that D-optimal placement of multiple displacement sensors yields approximately uniform spacing.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides two extensions of first order logic by `$\u03c9$-rules'. In each case we characterize the countable structures whose theory in the logic is categorical (has a unique model). In the one-sorted inferential $\u03c9$-logic, both Robinson's system $Q$ and Peano Arithmetic become categorical. In the two-sorted generalized $\u03c9$-logic we show\n  each complete $L_{\u03c9_1,\u03c9}$ sentence defines the same class of structures as a first-order theory with the appropriate $G-\u03c9$-rule. These logics are much weaker than second order logic and we argue that they do not appeal to the arithmetical concepts that the categoricity theorems themselves aim to secure. The results depend on proving that the inferential rules for the logics are categorical, i.e. they uniquely determine certain truth-conditions for the logical connectives and quantifiers. We provide an extensive answer to the doxological challenge (on referential determinacy) proposed in \\cite{ButtonWalshbook} and we develop a philosophical view of mathematics -which we call {\\em cognitive modelism}- according to which classical mathematics is best understood as a complex process of constructing and developing a distinctive class of concepts, rather than merely describing a fixed pre-existing realm of structures.\n  KEYWORDS: categoricity, inferentialism, first-order logic, first-order theories, $\u03c9$-rules, $L_{\u03c9_1,\u03c9}$.",

    "abstract": "The teaching of matrix multiplication in secondary education is often limited to the mechanical application of the row-by-column algorithm, leaving aside its interpretation as a geometric transformation. This study analyzes the impact of a GeoGebra-mediated instructional sequence, grounded in the Mathematical Working Space (MWS) framework, on students learning of the matrix product. Ten fifth-year secondary students from a school in Lima (Peru) participated in the study. The intervention was carried out over four sessions, combining manual activities with digital exploration using GeoGebra. The results show notable progress in students semiotic genesis, reflected in the coordination of algebraic, graphical, and numerical representations; in instrumental genesis, through the increasingly meaningful use of GeoGebra as a cognitive tool; and in discursive genesis, as students developed explanations of the geometric effects of matrices. A transition is observed from an algorithmic execution of matrix multiplication toward a conceptual understanding based on linear transformations. These findings suggest that task designs integrating manual work, dynamic visualization, and mathematical argumentation support deeper understanding of matrix multiplication and provide criteria for the reflective use of digital technologies in secondary linear algebra instruction.",

    "abstract": "Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression at the user equipment plays a key role in enabling accurate channel reconstruction and precoder design in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems. A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.",

We prove that for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), the mutual-visibility number $\u03bc(D)$ is always 1, and for directed cycles of length $n \\geq 3$, it is strictly 2. In contrast, we demonstrate that tournaments can support arbitrarily large mutual-visibility sets; specifically, using properties of Paley tournaments, we show that $\u03bc(T)$ grows linearly with the size of the tournament. On the algorithmic side, we show that while verifying a candidate set is polynomial-time solvable ($O(|S|(|V|+|A|))$), the problem of determining $\u03bc(D)$ is NP-hard for general digraphs. We also analyze the impact of strong bridges and strongly connected components on the upper bounds of $\u03bc(D)$.",

In this work, we study two approaches aimed at improving the symmetry properties of such an approximation scheme: one based on a quadrature rule for the Haar measure on the compact Lie group encoding the continuous symmetry of interest and one based on a random sampling of that Haar measure. We demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that the quadrature augmentation leads to exact symmetry preservation in polynomial models, while the random augmentation has only square-root convergence of the symmetrization error.",

Several authors have observed that balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs) provide nice examples of TPMs for LDP protocols. Indeed, it has been shown that such BIBD-based LDP protocols provide optimal estimators.\n  In this primarily expository paper, we give a detailed introduction to LDP protocols and their connections with block designs. We prove that a subclass of LDP protocols known as pure LDP protocols are equivalent to $(r,\u03bb)$-designs (which contain balanced incomplete block designs as a special case). An unbiased estimator for an LDP scheme is a left inverse of the transition probability matrix. We show that the optimal estimators for BIBD-based TPMs are precisely those obtained from the Moore-Penrose inverse of the corresponding TPM. We also review some existing work on optimal LDP protocols in the context of pure protocols.",

This work presents a novel approach for resolving flow problems using the LATIN-PGD solver. In this contribution, we place ourselves within the framework of Newtonian compressible and laminar flows. This specific and relatively simple case enables focusing on flows for which a state equation provides a direct relation between pressure and density. It is then possible to use the LATIN solver to set up a pressure-velocity decoupling algorithm. Moreover, Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) is natively included in the solver and yields two independent space-time decompositions for the velocity and the pressure fields. As a first step, the solver is validated on a problem for which an analytical solution is available. It is then applied to slightly more complex problems. The results show good agreement with the literature, and we expect that the solver could be used to compute more complicated material laws in the future.",

Previous numerical studies have shown that single- and double-precision matrix multiplication using the Ozaki-II scheme achieves higher throughput than that of standard BLAS routines on modern AI hardware equipped with fast INT8 matrix multiply-accumulate units with INT8 inputs and INT32 accumulation. However, the accuracy of the Ozaki-II scheme can degrade when the exponent distribution of the input matrices is wide, in which case a large number of low-precision matrix multiplications is required to obtain high-precision results. In this paper, we present a rigorous deterministic error analysis of the Ozaki-II scheme.

The construction accommodates multiple index sorts (worlds, times, locations) via a compound index space, representing intensions as linear operators. Modal operators are derived algebraically: accessibility relations become linear operators, and modal conditions reduce to threshold checks on accumulated values. For uncountable index domains, we develop a measure-theoretic generalization in which necessity becomes truth almost everywhere and possibility becomes truth on a set of positive measure, a non-classical logic natural for continuous parameters.",

    "abstract": "From a geometric viewpoint, billiard trajectories and geodesics are related by mutual approximation results. In one direction, it is known that every geodesic curve in the boundary of a smooth convex body can be approximated by a sequence of billiard trajectories inside of it. We establish the other direction by proving that, for Riemannian billiard tables (under mild assumptions), there exists a family of fold-type surfaces such that every sequence of geodesic segments on these surfaces has a subsequence that converges to a billiard trajectory in the table. In particular, this is true for convex Euclidean tables. We also describe a more general class of tables to which this result applies and present explicit non-Euclidean examples.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the existence and properties of stable, uniformly rotating star-planet systems, i.e. mass ratio is sufficiently small. It is modeled by the Euler-Poisson equations. Following the framework established by McCann for binary stars \\cite{McC06}, we adopt a variational approach, and prove the existence of local energy minimizers with respect to the Wasserstein $L^\\infty$ metric, under the assumed equation of state $P(\u03c1)=K\u03c1^\u03b3$ and under the condition that the mass ratio $m$ is sufficiently small, corresponding to a star-planet system. Such minimizers correspond to solutions of the Euler-Poisson system. We consider two cases. For $\u03b3> 2$, we not only prove existence but also show, via scaling arguments, that the radii (to be precise, the bounds of the supports of the minimizers) tend to zero. For $\\frac{3}{2} < \u03b3\\leq 2$, we estimate an upper bound for the (potential) expansion rates of the radii, and it turns out that the existence result remains valid in this case as well. Finally, we provide estimates for the distances between different connected components of supports of minimizers and propose a conjecture regarding the number of connected components.",

    "abstract": "Extreme rainfall over the Indian monsoon region poses severe societal and infrastructural risks but remains difficult to predict at daily time scales due to stochastic convective triggering and multiscale atmospheric interactions. While large-scale atmospheric fields provide important environmental context, their ability to localize extreme rainfall events is fundamentally limited. In this study, we examine how large-scale atmospheric information from ERA5 reanalysis can be leveraged for event-level probabilistic prediction of daily rainfall extremes over India. We compare an adaptive ConvLSTM baseline with a proposed Physics-Gated Latent Ordinary Differential Equation (PG-LODE) framework, which models atmospheric evolution as a continuous-time latent process whose dynamics are explicitly modulated by a physics-based gating mechanism under convectively unstable conditions. Extreme events are defined using the local 95th percentile of the India Meteorological Department gridded rainfall dataset during the June to September monsoon season. Pixel-wise evaluation shows limited skill for both models due to spatial displacement errors, whereas event-level tile-based verification reveals a clear performance contrast. The ConvLSTM remains highly conservative, detecting only 27 percent of extreme events, while PG-LODE achieves near-complete detection with a substantially higher critical success index and a moderate false alarm rate. These results demonstrate that physics-gated continuous-time latent dynamics offer a robust pathway for translating large-scale atmospheric predictability into reliable assessments of extreme rainfall risk.",

In contrast to the integer-order case, when \\(s\\notin\\mathbb N\\) the operator \\(\\mathcal{P}_s\\) does not enjoy the conformal covariance that allows one, in the upper half-space or ball model, to relate it to the Euclidean fractional Laplacian \\((-\u0394)^s\\); this link is crucial for importing Euclidean theory. We therefore introduce \\(\\widetilde{\\mathcal{P}}_s\\) (\\(s>0\\)), which is conformally related to \\((-\u0394)^s\\).

In this work, we propose the Physics-Driven Orthogonal Feature Method (PD-OFM), a framework for constructing feature representations that are explicitly tailored to both the differential operator and the computational domain by pretraining features using physics-informed objectives together with orthogonality regularization. This pretraining strategy yields nearly orthogonal feature bases. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence that physics-informed pretraining improves the approximation capability of the learned feature space. When employed to solve Helmholtz, Poisson, wave, and Navier-Stokes equations, the proposed method achieves residual errors 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than those of comparable methods. Furthermore, the orthogonality regularization improves transferability, enabling pretrained features to generalize effectively across different source terms and domain geometries for the same PDE.",

    "abstract": "We propose a novel error analysis framework for scaled generalized Laguerre and generalized Hermite approximations.This framework can be regarded as an analogue of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem: It characterizes the spatial and frequency bandwidths that can be effectively captured by Laguerre or Hermite sampling points. Provided a function satisfies the corresponding bandwidth constraints, it can be accurately approximated within this framework. The proposed framework is notably more powerful than classical theory -- it not only provides systematic guidance for choosing the optimal scaling factor, but also predicts root-exponential and other intricate convergence behaviors that classical approaches fail to capture. Leveraging this framework, we conducted a detailed comparative study of Hermite and Laguerre approximations. We find that functions with similar decay and oscillation characteristics may nonetheless display markedly different convergence rates. Furthermore, approximations based on two concatenated sets of Laguerre functions may offer significant advantages over those using a single set of Hermite functions.",

Distinct from canonical GCFs derived from classical hypergeometric series, the identity at hand features a complex polynomial architecture characterized by quartic partial numerators. Our approach utilizes an algebraic decomposition of the second-order shift operator $\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{T}^2 - b_n \\mathcal{T} - a_n$ into a coupled first-order system. This decomposition enables an exact mapping of the higher-order recurrence to a cascaded system, from which the continued fraction is identified as the reciprocal of an Ap\u00e9ry-like summation involving central binomial coefficients. The convergence is established through Pincherle's Theorem, confirming that the numerator sequence constitutes the minimal solution to the associated difference equation. This work provides a systematic operator-theoretic methodology for verifying automated conjectures of transcendental constants with high-degree polynomial coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $t$, an independent set $S\\subseteq V(G)$ is $t$-frugal if every vertex has at most $t$ neighbors in $S$. A $t$-frugal coloring of $G$ is a partition of its vertex set into $t$-frugal independent sets. The maximum cardinality of a $t$-frugal independent set in $G$ is denoted by $\u03b1_t^f(G)$, while the minimum cardinality of a $t$-frugal coloring of $G$, $\u03c7_t^f(G)$, is called the $t$-frugal chromatic number of $G$. Frugal colorings were introduced in 1998 and studied later in just a handful of papers. In this paper, we revisit this concept. While the NP-hardness of frugal coloring is known, we prove that the decision version of $\u03b1_t^f$ is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs, and present a linear-time algorithm to determine its value for trees. We prove a general sharp lower bound on $\u03c7_{t}^{f}(G)$ expressed in terms of $\u03b1_{t}^{f}(G)$ and size of $G$. We also give a sharp upper bound on the $\u03b1_2^f$ of any graph $G$, which in the case of graphs with minimum degree $\u03b4\\geq2$ simplifies to $\u03b1_2^f(G)\\le 2n/(\u03b4+2)$. We prove that $3\\le\u03c7_2^f(G)\\le 5$ holds for any graph $G$ with $\u0394(G)=3$. For several classes of graphs such as block graphs, the Cartesian and strong products of multiple two-way infinite paths, we determine the exact values of $\u03b1_2^f$. We provide sharp bounds on the $\u03b1_2^f$ in all four standard graph products, which are expressed as different invariants of their factors. Finally, we obtain Nordhaus-Gaddum type inequalities for the sum of the $2$-frugal chromatic numbers of $G$ and its complement from below and from above by functions of the order of $G$. For the upper bound $\u03c7_{2}^{f}(G)+\u03c7_{2}^{f}(\\overline{G})\\leq 3n/2$, we characterize the family of extremal graphs $G$.",

First, we transfer Lyndon's result from classical predicate calculus and prove LPP for all normal modal logics with the Lyndon interpolation property (LIP). Then we prove that all logics between K4.3 and S4.3 do not have LPP. We also show that among tabular extensions of S4 there are infinitely many logics with LPP and infinitely many logics without this property. Finally, we prove that all canonical monotone modal logics which are preserved under bisimulation products have both LIP and LPP. In particular, we show LIP and LPP for all logics that are axiomatizable over the minimal monotone logic EM by means of closed formulas and formulas of the form A(p) -> <>p, where A is positive.",

The approach aims to solve the problem of motion planning for planar motion systems using magnetic levitation that can be used in assembly lines, automated laboratories or clean-rooms. In these applications, time-optimal trajectories that can be computed in real-time are required to increase productivity and allow the vehicles to be reactive if needed. The presented approach encodes the environment representation using free-space corridors and represents the motion of the vehicle through such a corridor using a motion primitive. These primitives are selected heuristically and define the trajectory with a limited number of degrees of freedom, which are determined in an optimization problem. As a result, the method achieves significantly lower computation times compared to the state-of-the-art, most notably solving a full Optimal Control Problem (OCP), OMG-tools or VP-STO without significantly compromising optimality within a fixed corridor sequence. The approach is benchmarked extensively in simulation and is validated on a real-world Beckhoff XPlanar system",

One interpretation of the classical certainty equivalence principle for linear systems with output feedback and quadratic costs is as follows: the optimal action at each time is obtained by evaluating the optimal state-feedback policy of the stochastic linear system at the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimate of the state. Motivated by this interpretation, we consider certainty equivalent policies for general (non-linear) partially observed stochastic systems that allow for any state estimate rather than restricting to MMSE estimates. In such settings, the certainty equivalent policy is not optimal. For models where the cost and the dynamics are smooth in an appropriate sense, we derive upper bounds on the sub-optimality of certainty equivalent policies. We present several examples to illustrate the results.",

    "abstract": "We propose a fundamental metric for measuring the distance between two distributions. This metric, referred to as the decision-focused (DF) divergence, is tailored to stochastic linear optimization problems in which the objective coefficients are random and may follow two distinct distributions. Traditional metrics such as KL divergence and Wasserstein distance are not well-suited for quantifying the resulting cost discrepancy, because changes in the coefficient distribution do not necessarily change the optimizer of the underlying linear program. Instead, the impact on the objective value depends on how the two distributions are coupled (aligned). Motivated by optimal transport, we introduce decision-focused distances under several settings, including the optimistic DF distance, the robust DF distance, and their entropy-regularized variants. We establish connections between the proposed DF distance and classical distributional metrics. For the calculation of the DF distance, we develop efficient computational methods. We further derive sample complexity guarantees for estimating these distances and show that the DF distance estimation avoids the curse of dimensionality that arises in Wasserstein distance estimation. The proposed DF distance provides a foundation for a broad range of applications. As an illustrative example, we study the interpolation between two distributions. Numerical studies, including a toy newsvendor problem and a real-world medical testing dataset, demonstrate the practical value of the proposed DF distance.",

The target problem is the reproduction of mag-netic field-line structures in a helical fusion reactor configuration. Using identical training data sampled from exact solutions, we perform comparisons under matched mean squared error (MSE) levels. Visualization of magnetic field lines reveals that standard PINNs may exhibit structural collapse across magnetic surfaces even when the MSE is sufficiently small, whereas Trefftz-PINNs successfully preserve the global topology of magnetic field lines. Furthermore, the proposed framework is extended to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems, where streamline structures of veloc-ity fields are analyzed. Similar tendencies are observed, demonstrating that Trefftz-PINNs provide superior structure preservation compared to standard PINNs. These results indicate that minimizing numerical error alone does not guarantee physical consistency, and that constraining the solution space prior to learning is an effective strategy for physics-consistent surrogate modeling.",

In this study, we simulate this optically passive vision compression (OPVC) scheme and compare its rate-distortion performance to that of a standalone event camera (SAEC).

This cardinality is determined by the positive root system of the $A_{k-1}$ Weyl chamber.We decompose Euler's generating function into a finite sum of simplicial rational transforms. By applying Brion's localization theorem and the negative binomial expansion, we derive an exact closed-form formula with $O(1)$ computational complexity.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations coupled with the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation, which describes a two-phase mixture of the viscous incompressible fluid with particles or bubbles through a frictional force term. In the three-dimensional whole space, we construct a new class of suitable weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes-Vlasov-Fokker-Planck system satisfying energy estimates and three local or global energy inequalities of different forms. These obtained local energy inequalities play an important role in characterizing the measure of the singularity set of weak solutions. The main difficulties in deriving these inequalities lie in establishing the convergence of the density function $f$ in bounded or unbounded domains and dealing with the convergence of the non-local frictional force term. The strong convergence of both $f$ and $f \\log f$ weighted by $|v|^k$ is proved by exploring some new a priori quantities of the velocity with the help of Tao's $L^p$ decomposition and the DiPerna-Lions compactness method. Moreover, as an immediate consequence of the existence result, we are able to describe the Hausdorff dimension of set of singular points of the fluid velocity $u$ and also establish the $\u03b1$-H\u00f6lder continuity of $f$ at the regular points of $u$.",

We characterise broad classes of confining potentials for which the equilibrium measure is supported on the unit ball and admits an explicit density. Our main contribution is a converse construction: starting from a prescribed radially symmetric equilibrium density given as a power series in the squared radius, we determine the associated external potential and establish the corresponding Euler-Lagrange variational conditions. A key ingredient in the proof is an identity between two ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric functions evaluated at unit argument, which is of independent interest. As applications, we identify the external potentials corresponding to equilibrium densities proportional to $(1-|x|^2)^\u03b1$, $\u03b1>-1$, and show that these potentials can be expressed in terms of Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, reducing to polynomials for special values of $\u03b1$. We also determine the equilibrium measure associated with purely power-type external potentials, often referred to as Freud or Mittag--Leffler potentials in the context of log gases, for which the equilibrium density admits an explicit ${}_2F_1$ representation. Furthermore, we apply our framework to a Coulomb gas in dimension $d+1$ confined by a harmonic potential to the half-space. We derive a necessary condition under which the equilibrium measure is fully supported on the boundary hyperplane of dimension $d$, with the induced density corresponding to that of a Riesz gas with exponent $s=d-1$.",

This is in stark contrast with the 3D case, in which a wealth of nontrivial entire solutions with finite index (and energy density) is conversely known to exist, by work pioneered by Del Pino--Kowalczyk--Wei.

However, existing CPA schemes are restricted to an idealized setting in which the system cannot tolerate stragglers. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results by demonstrating a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted intersection threshold.",

    "abstract": "We propose an orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm for signal estimation in the rectangular spiked matrix model with general rotationally invariant (RI) noise. We establish a rigorous state evolution that exactly characterizes the high-dimensional dynamics of the algorithm. Building on this framework, we derive an optimal variant of OAMP that minimizes the predicted mean-squared error at each iteration. For the special case of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the fixed point of the proposed OAMP algorithm coincides with that of the standard AMP algorithm. For general RI noise models, we conjecture that the optimal OAMP algorithm is statistically optimal within a broad class of iterative methods, and achieves Bayes-optimal performance in certain regimes.",

The strong odd chromatic number of $G$ is defined as the smallest integer $k$ for which $G$ admits a strong odd coloring using $k$ colors. In this paper, we evaluate the strong odd chromatic number of join of cycles and empty graphs and one point union of graphs. Using these results, we construct infinite family of planar graphs that serves as counter examples to a recent conjecture regarding the upper bound of the strong odd chromatic number of planar graphs.",

Our main results rely on the algebraic properties of specific elliptic curves after performing a base change to suitable number fields. As a consequence, we establish that, under appropriate assumptions, any non-elementary arithmetic progression of five or six squares properly defined over a quadratic extension of $K$ must be of a specific form.

Backscatter communication (BackCom) is an attractive low-power paradigm, but its spectral efficiency declines in dense deployments. This paper presents an uplink BackCom design that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and maximizes system energy efficiency (EE). In a bistatic network where multiple backscatter nodes (BNs) harvest RF energy and alternate between sleep and active modes, we formulate a fractional program with coupled time, power, and reflection variables and develop a Dinkelbach-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with closed-form updates. Analysis reveals two operating modes depending on power availability, circuit demands and propagation conditions. Simulations show the proposed design adapts the time allocation, achieving up to 8% higher EE than fixed-power and 68% than no-sleep baselines, and delivering up to 127% EE gains over orthogonal multiple access (OMA). These results establish NOMA-enabled BackCom as a scalable, energy efficient solution for large-scale IoT deployments.",

This paper presents the task Footprints of the Walking of Numbers, a dynamic visualization proposal aimed at supporting the understanding of decimal numbers through the exploration of their infinite decimal expansions. The task is based on assigning vectors to the decimal digits from 0 to 9, so that the sequence of digits of a number generates a dynamic geometric path in the plane. Through the use of GeoGebra as a visualization environment, students can observe, compare, and interpret traces associated with different types of numbers, such as terminating decimals, repeating decimals, and irrational numbers, identifying visual regularities linked to their decimal behavior. The analysis is developed from a theoretical-didactical perspective, using the Mathematical Working Space as an interpretative lens to characterize the potential of the task design. In addition, the paper discusses the punctual use of generative AI tools exclusively as instrumental support for computation, without shifting the focus away from mathematical reasoning.",

In this paper we explore a higher-dimensional analogue of this theory, formulated with respect to the higher Auslander-Reiten translation $\u03c4_d$. In particular, we associate to any functorially finite $d$-torsion class a maximal $\u03c4_d$-rigid pair and a $(d+1)$-term silting complex. In the case $d=1$, the notions of maximal $\u03c4_d$-rigid and support $\u03c4$-tilting pairs coincide, and our theory recovers the classical bijections. However, the proof strategies for $d>1$ differ significantly. As an intermediate step, we prove that a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of a module category induces a $d$-cluster tilting subcategory of the category of $(d+1)$-term complexes, producing novel examples of $d$-exact categories. We introduce the notion of a $d$-torsion class in the exact setup, and use this to obtain the aforementioned $(d+1)$-term silting complex. We moreover apply our theory to study $d$-APR tilting modules and slices. To illustrate our results, we provide explicit combinatorial descriptions of maximal $\u03c4_d$-rigid pairs and $(d+1)$-term silting complexes for higher Auslander and higher Nakayama algebras.",

A key technical ingredient is a new memorization result for deep ReLU networks that enables efficient point fitting with dense architectures. We further introduce a class of compositional models in which each component function is smooth and acts on a domain of low intrinsic dimension. This framework unifies two common assumptions in the statistical learning literature, structural constraints on the target function and low dimensionality of the covariates, within a single model. We show that deep networks can approximate such functions at rates determined by the most difficult function in the composition. As an application, we derive improved convergence rates for empirical risk minimization in nonparametric regression that adapt to smoothness, compositional structure, and intrinsic dimensionality.",

In this paper, we introduce a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for dynamic divergence adaptation in vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)-based OWC networks. By continuously interacting with the environment, the RL agent autonomously learns a near-optimal mapping between receiver height and beam divergence, thereby eliminating the need for analytical modeling or computationally intensive exhaustive search. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves up to 92% coverage at low receiver heights and maintains robust performance under challenging conditions, enabling scalable, real-time, and energy-efficient beam control for dense VCSEL array deployments in next-generation OWC systems.",

In particular, we develop a framework for weighted consensus dynamics based on weighted Hodge Laplacian flows and show some decomposition results for weighted Hodge Laplacians. We then show that two key spectral functions of the weighted Hodge Laplacians, the trace of the pseudoinverse and the smallest non-zero eigenvalue, are jointly convex in upper and lower simplex weights and can be formulated as semidefinite programs.

In this paper, we study factor-balancedness and uniform factor-balancedness, making two main contributions. First, we establish general sufficient conditions for an infinite word to be (uniformly) factor-balanced, applicable in particular to any given linearly recurrent word. These conditions are formulated in terms of $\\mathcal{S}$-adic representations and generalize results of Adamczewski on primitive substitutive words, which show that balancedness of length-2 factors already implies uniform factor-balancedness. As an application of our criteria, we characterize the Sturmian words and ternary Arnoux--Rauzy words that are uniformly factor-balanced as precisely those with bounded weak partial quotients. Our second main contribution is a study of the relationship between factor-balancedness and factor complexity. In particular, we analyze the non-primitive substitutive case and construct an example of a factor-balanced word with exponential factor complexity, thereby making progress on a question raised in 2025 by Arnoux, Berth\u00e9, Minervino, Steiner, and Thuswaldner on the relation between balancedness and discrete spectrum.",

    "abstract": "The theory of point vortex dynamics has existed since Kirchhoff's proposal in 1891 and is still under development with connections to many fields in mathematics. As a strong simplification of the concept of vorticity it excels in computational speed for vorticity based fluid simulations at the cost of accuracy. Recent finding by Stefanella Boatto and Jair Koiller allowed the extension of this theory on to closed surfaces. A comprehensive guide to point vortex dynamics on closed surfaces with genus zero and vanishing total vorticity is presented here. Additionally fundamental knowledge of fluid dynamics and surfaces are explained in a way to unify the theory of point vortex dynamics of the plane, the sphere and closed surfaces together with implementation details and supplement material.",

In this paper, we investigate the existence of the Shilov boundary ideal in this context, as defined by Arveson (1969). To do this, by following the conceptual frameworks underlying Hamana's constructions of the injective envelope and the C*-envelope, respectively, we define the notions of the injective R-envelope and the R-C*-envelope for a unital local operator space. Furthermore, we show that the injective R-envelope construction given by us coincides with the one given by Dosi (2014).",

Second, we establish the corresponding regularity theory for convex sets in complex LCTVS's. Third, we develop a theory of regular embeddings for complex noncommutative convex sets, in the sense of Davidson and Kennedy. Finally, we use the complex theory to derive a theory of regular embeddings for real noncommutative convex sets. Interestingly, at present there appears to be no direct route to the latter.",

This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection. Experimental results on Gaussian sources and deep-learning-based semantic classification demonstrate that generative decompression closes a vast majority of the performance gap to the ideal joint-optimization benchmark, enabling adaptive, high-fidelity reconstruction without modifying the encoder.",

In particular we show examples in which the leftmost particle can be null recurrent, positive recurrent, ballistically transient, or subdiffusively transient.

The problem of stability in maniplexes is a natural variant of the problem of stability in graphs. A maniplex is stable if every automorphism of its canonical double cover is a lift of some automorphism of the original maniplex. Due to their very rich structure, regular (maximally symmetric) maniplexes are always stable. It is thus natural to ask what is the maximum possible degree of symmetry that a maniplex that is not stable can admit. Symmetry in maniplexes is usually measured by the number of orbits on flags (nodes) of their automorphism group. A few families of unstable maniplexes with 4 flag-orbits are known for rank 3. In this paper, we show that 2-orbit maniplexes exist for every rank n > 2$.",

For an open set $\\mathcal O$, a set $Z$ is a domain of determination when the values of solutions of the differential equation $Pu=0$ are determined on $Z$ by their values in $\\mathcal O$. Fritz John's global H\u00f6lmgren theorem implies that points that can be reached by deformations of noncharacteristic hypersufaces with initial surface and boundaries in $\\mathcal O$ belong to a domain of determination provided that local uniqueness holds at noncharacteristic surfaces. Using spacelike hypersurfaces yields sharp finite speed results whose domains of determination are described in terms of influence curves that never exceed the local speed of propagation. This paper studies deformations of noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces. We prove that points reachable by (repeated) deformations by noncharacteristic nonspacelike hypersurfaces coincide exactly with the set of points reachable by (repeated) homotopies of timelike arcs whose initial curves and endpoints belong to $\\mathcal O$. When the set $\\mathcal O$ is a small neighborhood of a forward timelike arc connecting $a$ to $b$, a natural candidate for $Z$ is the intesection of the future of $a$ with the past of $b$. This candidate is exact for D'Alembert's equation. We prove that it is also exact when $a,b$ are points close together on a fixed timelike arc. The timelike homotopy criterion fuels the construction of surprising examples for which the domain of determination is strictly larger (resp. strictly smaller) than the future-intersect-past candidate.",

    "abstract": "We show that a compact rigid balanced braided monoidal category with enough compact projective objects gives rise to a system of mapping class group representations compatible with the gluing along marked intervals. A motivation to consider non-finite tensor categories is the theory of vertex operator algebras where such categories arise as categories of modules. The mapping class group representations presented in this article admit a factorization homology description. In other words, they are of three-dimensional origin and hence obey a holographic principle. A compact projective symmetric Frobenius algebra endows the representations with a pointing that is mapping class group invariant and compatible with the gluing along intervals. This shows that, at least to some extent, many of the tools for the construction and study of spaces of conformal blocks and correlators remain available in a non-finite, but rigid setting.",

    "title": "A necessary and sufficient condition for discrete-time consensus on star boundaries",
    "abstract": "It is intuitive and well known, that if agents in a multi-agent system iteratively update their states in the Euclidean space as convex combinations of neighbors' states, all states eventually converge to the same value (consensus), provided the interaction graph is sufficiently connected. However, this seems to be also true in practice if the convex combinations of states are mapped or radially projected onto any unit $l_p$-sphere or even boundaries of star-convex sets, herein referred to as star boundaries. In this paper, we present insight into this matter by providing a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus of the normalized states (directions) for strongly connected directed graphs, which is equivalent to asymptotic consensus of states when the star boundaries are the same for all agents. Furthermore, we show that when asymptotic consensus occurs, the states converge linearly and the point of convergence is continuous in the initial states. Assuming a directed strongly connected graph provides a more general setting than that considered, for example, in gradient-based consensus protocols, where symmetric graphs are assumed. Illustrative examples and a vast number of numerical simulations showcase the theoretical results.",
