    "abstract": "Standard Navier--Stokes--Fourier theory and Maxwellian-based Grad 13-moment closures yield no independent pressure-gradient driving of the conductive heat flux in an isothermal, single-component gas in the hydrodynamic (small-Knudsen) regime. This absence is specific to the Maxwellian local-equilibrium weight. We show that when the closure is constructed about a generalized class of isotropic non-Maxwellian reference weights with finite fourth moment -- characterized by a single shape parameter (a kurtosis-like moment ratio) that deforms the distribution continuously away from a Maxwellian -- the small-Knudsen constitutive reduction retains a bulk pressure-gradient (barothermal) contribution to the conductive heat flux. This mechanism predicts pressure-driven conduction as a direct kinetic signature of non-Maxwellian equilibrium moment structure.",

    "abstract": "Spectral properties of Gram matrices are central to high dimensional asymptotic analyses of statistical estimators in regression and covariance estimation. These properties, in turn, depend critically on the extreme singular values and condition numbers of Gaussian random matrices. For many applications, sharp positive and negative moment bounds for these quantities are required to control expected prediction risk and related performance metrics. Although extensive work provides concentration and tail bounds for extreme singular values of Gaussian random matrices, these results do not readily yield the moment bounds needed in such analyses. Motivated by this gap, we establish non asymptotic moment bounds for arbitrary positive moments of the largest singular value and arbitrary negative moments of the smallest singular value, and uniform bounds for arbitrary positive moments of the condition number of high dimensional Gaussian random matrices. We demonstrate the utility of these bounds by applying them to derive explicit risk guarantees in high dimensional regression and covariance estimation, as well as to obtain bounds on the mean iteration complexity of gradient descent for solving Gram linear systems. Finally, we present counterexamples demonstrating that the positive condition number moment bounds and negative smallest singular value moment bounds cannot, in general, be extended to the broader class of sub Gaussian random matrices.",

    "abstract": "We propose a reaction--diffusion model of predator--prey interaction in which the predators occupy only a subset of the prey's territory, leaving a predator-free exclusion zone. Ecological examples include marine protected areas where it is illegal to fish, or buffer zones left between the territories of rival predators. The prey are subject to a strong Allee effect, so excessive predation may lead to the extinction of both species. The exclusion zone mitigates this problem by providing the prey with a refuge in which to proliferate without predation. Thus, paradoxically, a smaller predator territory may be able to support a more substantial population than a larger one. Using a topological degree argument, we show in any dimensions that, provided the exclusion zone is large enough, the system possesses spatially heterogeneous coexistence equilibria with positive populations of both species. This result is global in the sense that it does not rely on local bifurcations from semi-trivial stationary states. We also show that as the predator domain becomes asymptotically small, the total predator population does not vanish, and in some cases may actually be maximized in this limit of shrinking predation area. Conversely, we show that as the predator domain becomes large, it may exhibit thresholding behavior, passing suddenly from a regime with coexistence solutions to one in which extinction becomes unavoidable, highlighting the need for careful analysis in the management of predator--prey systems.",

Fix a Kummer level $n\\ge 1$ and an irregular type $\u03a6$ along $D$, and consider the logarithmic Betti boundary $X^{\\log}_n$ (the level-$n$ Kato--Nakayama space). We construct a strictly $1$-categorical, cover-based Betti presenter for Stokes torsors by building a small strict \u010cech--Stokes collar groupoid on a punctured logarithmic collar of $D$, together with a canonical projection $\u03c0$ to the underlying sector \u010cech groupoid. The central observation is that the appropriate collar Stokes moduli is the groupoid of strict functorial sections $\\operatorname{Sec}(\u03c0)$ (equivalently, $\\mathrm{St}_\u03a6$-torsors on the sector cover), yielding a fully explicit presenter that remains small and strictly functorial. We then glue the collar presenter to the ordinary \u010cech presenter of $U:=X\\setminus D$ through a strict diagram of small groupoids and an explicit $2$-pushout presenter $G_{\u03a6,n}$. We prove that global Stokes objects, defined intrinsically as a $2$-fiber product, are computed by a strict torsorial gluing problem, i.e.\\ by Stokes-corrected torsorial representations of $G_{\u03a6,n}$. In arbitrary SNC depth we solve the local corner presentation problem by an explicit chamber-complex model on the angular torus: Stokes torsors are nonabelian cocycles on the $1$-skeleton with relations read off from $2$-cells. The overall construction is canonical up to Morita equivalence with a contractible space of identifications (invariant under stratified subdivision), and it is compatible with Kummer descent along all normal crossings strata via $(\u03bc_n)^k$-equivariant local models and descent to homotopy fixed points.",

    "abstract": "Income-based poverty indicators are insufficient to fully explain the multifaceted socio-economic issue of energy poverty. The ability of households to obtain and use energy services sustainably is significantly influenced by structural factors like building efficiency, energy prices, climate, and regional disparities. Moreover, the assessment of energy poverty inherently involves uncertainty, vagueness, and subjective judgments, which limit the applicability of classical deterministic evaluation approaches. This paper proposes a novel, integrated MCDM framework based on FFSs to address these issues. To objectively assess the uncertainty present in FF-information, a novel FF-entropy metric is first presented. The proposed entropy employs a nonlinear structure, enabling a more flexible and sensitive representation of fuzziness in complex decision environments. The subjective weights obtained from the FF-PIPRECIA approach are then blended with the entropy-based objective weights. Lastly, options are ranked according to their relative usefulness in relation to ideal and anti-ideal solutions using the FF-MARCOS approach. The proposed framework is applied to the regional evaluation of energy poverty in Turkiye, considering seven geographical regions and six key criteria: income level, energy prices, energy efficiency, building efficiency, climate, and urbanization. Sensitivity analysis, weight perturbation analysis, and entropy-criterion dominance analysis validate the robustness and stability of the suggested model across various parameter settings. For policymakers and practitioners seeking to develop focused, effective, and socially just energy policies amid uncertainty, the proposed method provides a robust, adaptable decision-support tool.",

Our main result shows that this rate vanishes if and only if no loop isotopism exists between a loop and its opposite, providing a structural criterion for chirality. A strengthened variant based on translation-generated symmetries is discussed in the appendix.",

    "abstract": "Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple connected graph. A connected edge cover of $G$ is a subset $S\\subseteq E$ such that every vertex of $G$ is incident with at least one edge in $S$ and the subgraph induced by $S$ is connected. The connected edge cover polynomial of $G$ is defined as $E_c(G,x)=\\sum_{i} e_c(G,i)x^i$, where $e_c(G,i)$ denotes the number of connected edge covers of $G$ with exactly $i$ edges. In this paper, we derive explicit formulas for both the connected edge cover polynomials and the total number of connected edge covers for several important graph families, including wheels, complete graphs $K_n$, complete bipartite graphs $K_{2,n}$, friendship graphs, and lollipop graphs. Each formula is accompanied by a combinatorial proof and verified by computational enumeration for small orders.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the asymmetric numbers of communities in multi-layer directed networks is a challenging problem due to the multi-layer structures and inherent directional asymmetry, leading to possibly different numbers of sender and receiver communities. This work addresses this issue under the multi-layer stochastic co-block model, a model for multi-layer directed networks with distinct community structures in sending and receiving sides, by proposing a novel goodness-of-fit test. The test statistic relies on the deviation of the largest singular value of an aggregated normalized residual matrix from the constant 2. The test statistic exhibits a sharp dichotomy: Under the null hypothesis of correct model specification, its upper bound converges to zero with high probability; under underfitting, the test statistic itself diverges to infinity. With this property, we develop a sequential testing procedure that searches through candidate pairs of sender and receiver community numbers in a lexicographic order. The process stops at the smallest such pair where the test statistic drops below a decaying threshold. For robustness, we also propose a ratio-based variant algorithm, which detects sharp changes in the sequence of test statistics by comparing consecutive candidates. Both methods are proven to consistently determine the true numbers of sender and receiver communities under the multi-layer stochastic co-block model.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we prove Aldous's conjecture from 1987 that there is no backoff protocol that is stable for any positive arrival rate. The setting is a communication channel for coordinating requests for a shared resource. Each user who wants to access the resource makes a request by sending a message to the channel. The users don't have any way to communicate with each other, except by sending messages to the channel. The operation of the channel proceeds in discrete time steps. If exactly one message is sent to the channel during a time step then this message succeeds (and leaves the system). If multiple messages are sent during a time step then these messages collide. Each of the users that sent these messages therefore waits a random amount of time before re-sending. A backoff protocol is a randomised algorithm for determining how long to wait -- the waiting time is a function of how many collisions a message has had. Specifically, a backoff protocol is described by a send sequence $\\overline{p} = (p_0,p_1,p_2,\\ldots)$. If a message has had $k$ collisions before a time step then, with probability $p_k$, it sends during that time step, whereas with probability $1-p_k$ it is silent (waiting for later). The most famous backoff protocol is binary exponential backoff, where $p_k = 2^{-k}$. Under Kelly's model, in which the number of new messages that arrive in the system at each time step is given by a Poisson random variable with mean $\u03bb$, Aldous proved that binary exponential backoff is unstable for any positive $\u03bb$. He conjectured that the same is true for any backoff protocol. We prove this conjecture.",

We also derive a limit in law for the scaled location of the vertex visited last by the walk. Here the limit turns out to be precisely the critical Liouville Measure, normalized by its total mass. Both limits hold jointly with the limiting joint law explicitly described. These results resolve well known open problems in the field, in the case of wired boundary conditions.

In this work, we exploit this kinetic embedding to formulate a modified initial-value problem for one-dimensional Lorentz-boosted diffusion. We show that the resulting dynamics are well posed both forward and backward in time, provided the boosted density profiles admit a kinetic-theory realization. Such profiles form a space of band-limited functions, within which the evolution can be expressed as a discrete superposition of spatially sampled initial data, weighted by a Shannon-Whittaker-type Green function defined on the full Minkowski plane.

However, standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) faces severe theoretical and numerical challenges when applied to this broader class, particularly regarding non-convexity and instability in sparse regimes. To resolve these issues, this paper introduces a unified estimation framework based on the Fenchel-Young loss. By leveraging the intrinsic convex conjugate structure of PUMs, we demonstrate that the Fenchel-Young estimator guarantees global convexity and bounded gradients, providing a mathematically natural alternative to MLE. Addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity, we further extend this framework via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization. We first derive an exact finite-dimensional reformulation of the infinite-dimensional primal problem, establishing its theoretical convexity. However, recognizing that the resulting worst-case constraints involve computationally intractable inner maximizations, we subsequently construct a tractable safe approximation by exploiting the global Lipschitz continuity of the Fenchel-Young loss. Through this tractable formulation, we uncover a rigorous geometric unification: two canonical regularization techniques, standard L2-regularization and the margin-enforcing Hinge loss, emerge mathematically as specific limiting cases of our distributionally robust estimator. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and the Swissmetro benchmark validate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional methods, recovering stable preferences even under severe data limitations.",

A logarithmic Sobolev-type inequality is employed to control oscillations in the mass density. Furthermore, by constructing a combined functional that incorporates both the GCP energy and the physical entropy, we derive the exponential decay of solutions. As a byproduct of our approach, we also prove the global existence of $H^2$ solutions for a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger-Langevin equation.\n  Finally, for GCP solutions that remain bounded away from vacuum, we justify the time-relaxation limit and provide an explicit convergence rate. Our analysis relies on compactness techniques that does not require the existence or smoothness of solutions to the limiting equations. Moreover, our results impose no well-preparedness conditions on the initial data, thereby accommodating the possible formation of an initial layer.",

We want to ensure that all players feel that they have been treated fairly, not only after the last day, but after every single day. We present two 'balance' conditions on sequences of permutations. One condition can always be satisfied, but is arguably too weak; a second condition is strong, and can be satisfied for all n <= 11, but cannot be satisfied for some larger values of n, including all n>61.\n  We then relate the 'balance' condition to the requirement that the cumulative assignment is proportional up to one item (PROP1), where proportionality holds in a strong ordinal sense -- for every valuations that are consistent with the item ranking. We present a third balance condition that implies ordinal PROP1. We show that a sequence guaranteeing this balance condition exists for all n <= 12, but might not exist when n=6k for any k >= 19.\n  Finally, we present a fourth, weaker balance condition on a sequence, that guarantees ordinal proportionality up to two items (PROP2).

Meanwhile, emerging 6G demands such as immersive communications and environmental sensing pose challenges to traditional signal processing. To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms.",

This property, termed perfect c-nonlinearity (PcN), represents optimal resistance to c-differential attacks - a concern highlighted by recent cryptanalysis of the Kuznyechik cipher variant. We provide the first characterization using the classical difference distribution table (DDT): F is PcN if and only if Delta_F(a,b) Delta_F(a,c^{-1}b) = 0 for all nonzero a,b. This enables verification in O(p^{2n}) time given a precomputed DDT, a significant improvement over the naive O(p^{3n}) approach. We prove a strict dichotomy for monomial permutations: the derivative F(x + alpha) - cF(x) is either a permutation for all nonzero shifts or for none, with the general case remaining open. For quadratic permutations, we provide explicit algebraic characterizations. We identify the first class of affine transformations preserving c-differential uniformity and derive tight nonlinearity bounds revealing fundamental incompatibility between PcN and APN properties.

In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming. Guided communication, in contrast, confines signals within a physical medium, significantly reducing interference and supporting higher data rates over longer distances. Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we consider causal inference in various high-dimensional treatment settings, including for single multi-valued treatments and vector treatments with binary or continuous components, when the number of treatments can be comparable to or even larger than the number of observations. These settings bring unique challenges: first, the treatment effects of interest are a high-dimensional vector rather than a low-dimensional scalar; second, positivity violations are often unavoidable; and third, estimation can be based on a smaller effective sample size. We first discuss fundamental limits of estimating effects here, showing that consistent estimation is impossible without further assumptions. We go on to propose a novel sparse pseudo-outcome regression framework for arbitrary high-dimensional statistical functionals, which includes generic constrained regression estimators and error guarantees. We use the framework to derive new doubly robust estimators for mean potential outcomes of high-dimensional treatments, though it can also be applied to other scenarios. We analyze the proposed estimators under exact and approximate sparsity assumptions, giving finite-sample risk bounds. Finally, we derive minimax lower bounds to characterize optimal rates of convergence and show our risk bounds are unimprovable.",

    "abstract": "Numerical computations involving rational matrices often benefit from preserving underlying matrix structures such as symmetry, Hermitian properties, or sparsity that reflect physical, geometric, or algebraic characteristics of the system. Maintaining such structures enhances stability, accuracy, and efficiency. Linearization, a technique that reformulates rational matrix problems as generalized eigenvalue problems (GEPs) of larger matrices, is widely used but does not automatically retain structure. In this chapter, we focus on structured linearizations, which preserve both the spectral information of the original rational matrix and its intrinsic structural properties. To achieve this, we present the construction of a family of linearizations called generalized Fiedler pencils with repetition (GFPR), which we prove to be valid linearizations for rational matrices. Moreover, we demonstrate that the GFPR family serves as a versatile framework for generating structured linearizations, specifically symmetric, skew-symmetric, T-even, and T-odd linearizations, provided the original rational matrix exhibits the corresponding structure. These structured linearizations facilitate the use of specialized, structure-preserving algorithms, reduce numerical errors, and yield physically meaningful solutions in application",

The classical real line embeds as a genuine subfield $\\mathbb{R}_{\\mathrm{cl}}\\subset H$, and all field operations agree with the usual ones on $\\mathbb{R}$. The additive structure of $H$ is almost associative but not a canonical hypergroup.

We propose surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis that combines computational efficiency with a rigorous assessment of parameter influence. In this work, we analyze the recently proposed hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model, which describes fluid flows in coupled free-flow and porous-medium systems with arbitrary flow directions at the fluid--porous interface. The model results from vertical averaging and contains several unknown parameters. We perform surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices to investigate the sensitivity of the model to variations of physical parameters for two test cases: filtration and splitting flows. However, constructing surrogates for higher-dimensional random fields requires either many training runs or sophisticated sampling strategies. To address this, we compare polynomial chaos surrogates, including sparse and multi-resolution representations, for their efficiency in global sensitivity analysis, using a predefined Sobol' sequence of training samples. Across the tested cases, multi-resolution approach delivers the most accurate estimation of Sobol' indices.",

For Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type kinetics, we show that this principle is equivalent to a minimal relaxation-time principle, selecting among admissible constitutive responses the one with the fastest compatible relaxation toward equilibrium.\n  We show how the caloric equation of state, entropy balance, and entropy production can be computed from kinetic theory, and we propose a hybrid methodology in which the Chapman--Enskog expansion is used only to compute entropy production and equilibrium thermodynamic relations, while full constitutive closures are obtained through constrained optimization. The proposed hybrid Chapman-Enskog-Rajagopal-Srinivasa approach recovers the standard Euler and Navier-Stokes-Fourier constitutive laws for monatomic gases.

Unlike traditional correlation-based approaches, we construct a complete signed graph for each trading day within a specified time window, where the sign of an edge between a pair of assets is determined by the relative behavior of their log returns with respect to their mean returns. Within this framework, we introduce a combinatorial interpretation of higher-order moments, showing that maximizing skewness and minimizing kurtosis correspond to maximizing balanced triangles and balanced 4-cliques with specific signed edge configurations respectively. We establish that the latter leads to an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, while the former is naturally guaranteed by the structural properties of the signed graph model. Based on this interpretation, we propose a dimensionality reduction method using a combinatorial formulation of the mean-variance optimization problem through a combinatorial hedge score metric for assets. The proposed framework is validated through extensive backtesting on 199 S\\&P 500 assets over a 16-year period (2006 - 2021), demonstrating the effectiveness of reduced asset universes for portfolio construction using both Markowitz optimization and equally weighted strategy.",

    "abstract": "Locking is a common effect in finite element and isogeometric analysis. In the case of plates, transverse shear locking is most prominent, for shells several other types of locking exist. A common cure are mixed methods that introduce additional fields of unknowns into the variational formulation. These fields reduce constraints and thus alleviate locking significantly. As a drawback, the discretized additional fields increase computational costs significantly. These fields are often eliminated by static condensation, which requires the inverse of a part of the stiffness matrix. In Lagrange-based finite elements, this inverse is computed on element level, due to a discontinuous interpolation of additional fields. Since isogeometric analysis features higher continuity, static condensation must be performed on patch level, which requires a costly matrix inversion on that level. In this contribution, the virtual shear parameters of a mixed isogeometric plate formulation are interpolated by enhanced approximate dual basis functions. This allows to conduct row-sum lumping of the relevant matrix part at a minimal loss of accuracy, since this part becomes diagonal dominant. For a properly chosen integration space, this lumped matrix becomes the identity matrix. Thus, the proposed condensation procedure does not require an inversion anymore. The crucial and novel point is the proposed treatment of knot vectors with limited internal continuity. With the help of several single- and multi-patch examples, both with full and with limited internal continuity, we show that the proposed procedure obtains optimal error convergence rates in all cases, while without these alterations, convergence rates are significantly deteriorated.",

In our previous work we described this chamber decomposition by means of the hyperplane arrangement. It is important to note that to any chamber it corresponds the compact space, which is a smooth compact manifold for a chamber of maximal dimension. In this paper we obtain explicit description of the cohomology rings of the symplectic $T^n$ - reductions on $G_{n,2}$ for the standard moment map in terms of the chamber decomposition of $\u0394_{n,2}$ and the well known results of Kirwan and Goldin.\n  We recently introduced the Hassett category whose objects are special compactifications of the space $\\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$. The initial object in this category is the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{0, n}$. In this paper we describe the cohomology rings of various compactifications for $\\mathcal{M}_{0, n}$, which correspond to the objects of the Hassett category. Our results show that even in the case $n=5$ there are objects in the Hassett category with different cohomology rings.",

This set has been recently shown to be convex in some practically relevant settings in modern wireless networks, including cell-less networks. However, even under convexity, sum-rate maximization is challenging because the nonlinear spectral radius characterization of the achievable rate region is difficult to handle directly. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting subgradient projections onto the level sets of suitably reformulated spectral radius functions. Notably, the derived subgradient projection algorithm provably converges to the global optimum of the sum-rate maximization problem under the convexity condition. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is illustrated in simulations for cell-less networks.",

By analyzing two important structured subclasses, we obtain exact determinations and improved upper bounds that significantly narrow this gap.\n  For simple biquadratic forms those containing only distinct terms of the type $x_i^2 y_j^2$ we prove that the maximum achievable SOS rank is exactly 7, a value attained by a form corresponding to a $C_4$-free bipartite graph with the maximum number of edges. This settles the question for simple forms.\n  For $y$-deficient biquadratic forms a class introduced here that permits cross terms among two of the three $y$-variables while the third appears only in pure square terms we prove an upper bound of $9$ by combining Calder\u00f6n's theorem on $m\\times 2$ forms with the known value $\\mathrm{BSR}(4,2) = 5$.\n  Our main result is a constructive proof that $\\mathrm{BSR}(4,3) \\geq 8$.

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communications has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless systems due to its potential to support extremely high data rates. However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems.",

    "abstract": "For several physically relevant SPDEs, it is known that global weak solutions coexist with local strong ones. Typically, weak-strong uniqueness results are known, and ensure that the global and strong solutions coincide as long as the latter exist. Times at which a weak solution does not coincide with a strong one are called singular times. Determining their fractal dimension is fundamental to capturing the regularity of weak solutions.\n  We define singular times for a wide class of semilinear SPDEs. We show that sets of singular times have fractal dimension (i.e., Hausdorff and/or Minkowski) at most $ 1-\\ell\\, \\mathsf{Exc}$, where $\\ell$ and $\\mathsf{Exc}$ are the time integrability and the excess of spatial regularity compared to the critical regularity of the energy bound associated with weak solutions, respectively. Moreover, their corresponding $(1-\\ell\\,\\mathsf{Exc} )$-dimensional measure is zero. We formulate and apply our theory to quenched strong Leray-Hopf solutions of 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with physically relevant noises, including rough Kraichnan and Lie transport. In particular, we extend the fundamental $1/2$-dimensional bound of Leray and Scheffer on singular times for 3D NSEs to the stochastic setting, and we prove new conditional results under supercritical Serrin's conditions, irrespective of the roughness of the noise. Our framework is new even in the deterministic case, and provides the first partial regularity results for weak solutions to SPDEs with multiplicative noise.",

Given a discrete ordinates discretization, we report the corresponding matrix structures, depending on model and discretization parameters. Despite the possibly dense nature of these matrices, the use of Krylov methods is effective (especially in the matrix-free context) and robust. We propose a theoretical analysis, using the spectral tools of the symbol theory, explaining why Krylov convergence is robust w.r.t. all the discretization parameters, even in the unpreconditioned case. In fact, the compactness of the continuous operators used in the modeling leads to zero-clustered dense matrix sequences plus identity, so that the clustering at the unity of the spectra is deduced. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, which have a direct application, for example, in the simulation of radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres, a key problem in astrophysical research. In general, we demonstrate that optimal scaling with respect to RT discretization parameters is expected for Krylov solution strategies.",

We accomplish this by introducing the notion of system interpolation, which determines whether the input-state trajectories of a continuous-time system can be realized as piecewise polynomial interpolations of the input-state trajectories of a discrete-time system. In this context, a piecewise polynomial interpolation of a discrete-time signal is characterized as a continuous-time function that coincides with the discrete-time signal at given sampling instants and can be realized as a polynomial of a prescribed degree over intervals between these instants. By representing piecewise polynomial functions as linear combinations of shifted Legendre polynomials, we characterize system interpolation as a subspace inclusion that is completely in terms of system parameters. This therefore allows for a computationally efficient comparison of the input-state behavior of a continuous-time system with that of a discrete-time one. We then exploit this characterization to discretize a given continuous-time system into a discrete-time one. Lastly, given a control specification, we exploit system interpolation to synthesize controllers that ensure satisfaction at each given sampling instant, while they measure the extent of (possible) violation over intervals between these instants.",

    "abstract": "Mixed-Integer Programs (MIPs) are NP-hard optimization models that arise in a broad range of decision-making applications, including finance, logistics, energy systems, and network design. Although modern commercial solvers have achieved remarkable progress and perform effectively on many small- and medium-sized instances, their performance often degrades when confronted with large-cale or highly constrained formulations. This paper explores the use of the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO) framework as a flexible, metaheuristic alternative for computing high-quality solutions to MIPs through the design of problem-specific decoders. The proposed approach separates the search process from feasibility enforcement by operating in a continuous random-key space while mapping candidate solutions to feasible integer solutions via efficient decoding procedures. We evaluate the methodology on two representative and structurally distinct benchmark problems: the mean-variance Markowitz portfolio optimization problem with buy-in and cardinality constraints, and the Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem. For each formulation, tailored decoders are developed to reduce the effective search space, promote feasibility, and accelerate convergence. Computational experiments demonstrate that RKO consistently produces competitive, and in several cases superior, solutions compared to a state-of-the-art commercial MIP solver, both in terms of solution quality and computational time. These results highlight the potential of RKO as a scalable and versatile heuristic framework for tackling challenging large-scale MIPs.",

    "abstract": "The conditions under which stochastic systems of infinitely many interacting particles can maintain sufficient spatial order to move coherently along a time-periodic orbit, thereby breaking the time-translation invariance of the underlying dynamical equation, have been an elusive issue. Via a free energy technique, we prove that if a non-reversible interacting particle system on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d=1,2$, with strictly positive rates admits a product measure as a stationary measure, then it cannot exhibit time-periodic behaviour. This provides a first step towards a general conjecture that time-periodic behaviour cannot occur in one- and two-dimensional systems with short-range interactions and constitutes the first result for non-reversible dynamics in dimension two.",

Building on the particle-kinetic-hydrodynamic hierarchy developed for non-rotating floes, we generalize the particle model to describe ice floes as rigid bodies characterized by position, linear velocity, angular velocity, size, and moment of inertia. The interaction rules now include nonlinear contact forces and torques arising from short-range compression, restitution, and tangential friction laws, together with hydrodynamic drag that couples translational and rotational motions. These particle descriptions lead to an enriched Vlasov-type kinetic equation posed on an extended phase space, whose moments yield a hydrodynamic system for mass, momentum, and angular-momentum balances. Compared with Part I, the resulting macroscopic equations feature additional stress contributions, rotational transport, and dissipative mechanisms stemming from nonlinear collisions. The proposed framework provides a more realistic description of sea-ice floe dynamics and offers a systematic pathway toward multiscale modeling of sea-ice rheology under complex environmental forcing.",

    "abstract": "The $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$-orbits of primitive $n$-squared origamis can be represented by finite four-regular graphs. It is a conjecture of McMullen that the orbit graphs of such origamis in the stratum $\\mathcal{H}(2)$ form an expander family. We provide indirect evidence for this conjecture by proving that the absolute values of the Euler characteristics of the graphs in this family go to infinity with the number of squares $n$. This generalises previous work of the authors, in which we established eventual non-planarity for this family, and provides the strongest indirect evidence to date for McMullen's conjecture. We also prove that the same phenomenon holds for primitive origamis in the Prym loci of $\\mathcal{H}(4)$ and $\\mathcal{H}(6)$. Assuming conjectures of Zmiaikou and Delecroix--Leli\u00e8vre, we establish the same in $\\mathcal{H}(1,1)$ and for two families of non-Prym origamis in $\\mathcal{H}(4)$. Finally, assuming a stronger conjecture concerning orbit growth in low-complexity strata, we establish that for any family of $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$-orbit graphs of primitive origamis in a stratum with one or two conical singularities, the absolute values of the Euler characteristics of the graphs go to infinity with the number of squares along a density one subsequence. By relating the genus of the elliptic generator orbit graphs to the genus of the associated arithmetic Teichm\u00fcller curves, we also recover results of Mukamel and extend results of Torres-Teigel--Zachhuber establishing that the genus of these Teichm\u00fcller curves in $\\mathcal{H}(2)$ and the Prym loci of $\\mathcal{H}(4)$ and $\\mathcal{H}(6)$ also go to infinity. The proofs rely on counts of integral points on algebraic hypersurfaces using methods of Bombieri--Pila and Browning--Gorodnik, on counts of orbifold points on Teichm\u00fcller curves, and on counts of pseudo-Anosov diffeomorphisms with bounded dilatation.",

Necessary and sufficient conditions for valid parity assignments are established in terms of distance constraints between codewords and their nearest non-codewords. It is shown that the Hamming-distance-3 relations among Hamming codewords induce a bipartite graph, a fundamental geometric property that is exploited to develop a systematic SEFCC construction. By deriving a tight upper bound on the sum of pairwise distances, we prove that the proposed bipartite construction uniquely achieves the maximum sum-distance, the largest possible minimum distance of 2, and the minimum number of distance-2 codeword pairs. Consequently, for the HCMF SEFCC problem, sum-distance maximisation is not merely heuristic-it exactly enforces the optimal distance-spectrum properties relevant to error probability. Simulation results over AWGN channels with soft-decision decoding confirm that the resulting max-sum SEFCCs provide significantly improved data protection and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to arbitrary valid assignments.",

The proposed approach, which we first present in abstract form, generates a hierarchical sequence of adaptively refined finite-dimensional approximation spaces and employs a (nonlinear) conjugate gradient (CG) method to compute suitable approximations on each space. A core novelty of our approach is that all components of the algorithm are consistently driven by energy reduction principles rather than by classical a posteriori estimators. In particular, adaptive refinement is steered by local energy reduction indicators which aim to construct subsequent approximation spaces in a way that attains the largest potential decrease in energy. Likewise, the stopping criteria for the iterative solver are based on either relative or averaged energy reductions on each subspace. As a concrete realization, we present a concise implementation for $\\mathbb{P}_1$ finite element discretizations of second-order semilinear elliptic diffusion-reaction models, where the local indicators driving the element refinements are computed based on edge-wise energy reductions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting scheme achieves optimal convergence for various benchmark problems in two-dimensional polygonal domains.",

    "abstract": "Eigenvalue and eigenvector perturbation theory is a fundamental topic in several disciplines, including numerical linear algebra, quantum physics, and related fields. The central problem is to understand how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}$ change under the addition of a perturbation matrix $E \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}$. Much of the existing literature focuses on structured perturbations. For example, in [C.-K. Li and R.-C. Li, Linear Algebra Appl. 2005], the matrix $A$ is assumed to be Hermitian and block diagonal, while the perturbation $E$ is Hermitian and block off-diagonal. In this work, we investigate a different structured setting in which the perturbation has the commutator form $E = AB - BA$ for some matrix $B$, which we show to be a generalization of the block diagonal structure considered by Li and Li. First, we extend their main result by showing that the perturbation of the $i$-th eigenvalue of $A$, denoted by $\u03bb_i$, is of order $\\|E\\|^2 / \u03b7_i$, where $\u03b7_i = \\min_{j \\neq i} |\u03bb_i - \u03bb_j|$ is the spectral gap associated with $\u03bb_i$. Second, we provide a detailed analysis of the role played by the matrix $B$ in the perturbation of the eigenvectors. This analysis is further generalized to the case of block-diagonal matrices with multiple eigenvalues, as well as to perturbed singular values and eigenvalues of Jordan blocks.",

Salient features of the result are: (i) error bounds are not only uniform in $\\varepsilon$ but improve as $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0$; and (ii) no restriction on $\u03c4$ in terms of $\\varepsilon$. The analysis combines iterated Duhamel's expansions and a transformation that exploits cancellations in oscillatory phases that cannot be obtained directly from regularity estimates of the exact solution.

We prove that both symbols ${\\tt 0},{\\tt 1}$ occur with frequency $1/2$ and we show uniform recurrence and symmetry properties of its set of factors. The proof reveals a structural bridge between combinatorics on words and harmonic analysis: the first difference sequence is shown to be Toeplitz, providing dynamical rigidity, while filtered frequencies naturally encode a dyadic structure that lifts to the compact group of $2$-adic integers. In this $2$-adic setting, desubstitution becomes a linear operator on Fourier coefficients, and a spectral contraction argument enforces uniqueness of limiting densities. Our results answer several conjectures of Dekking (on a sibling sequence) and illustrate how harmonic analysis on compact groups can be fruitfully combined with substitution dynamics.",

    "title": "Quadratic Equations over Graph Products and the Exponent of Periodicity",
    "abstract": "In 1977, Makanin established the decidability of equations in free monoids. A key ingredient in his proof is the exponent of periodicity: for a word $w$, it is the largest exponent $e$ such that $w$ contains a nonempty factor of the form $p^e$. Makanin showed that if a system of equations in a free monoid has a solution with sufficiently large exponent of periodicity, then it has infinitely many solutions. However, the converse -- whether the existence of infinitely many solutions implies the existence of solutions with arbitrarily large exponent of periodicity -- remains open.\n  In this paper, we investigate the analogous problem for quadratic equations in finitely generated groups. Using normal forms to define the exponent of periodicity, we identify structural conditions on groups and their normal forms that guarantee that infinite solution sets of quadratic systems have an unbounded exponent of periodicity. We prove that these conditions are preserved under graph products and, in particular, hold for all finitely generated right-angled Artin groups. In addition, we show that they also hold for finitely generated (graph products of) torsion-free nilpotent and hyperbolic groups, and we characterize the Baumslag-Solitar groups satisfying them.",

However, its linear convergence rate suffers from ill-conditioned problems and is highly sensitive to the smallest nonzero singular value. In this work, we aim to extend the classical Kaczmarz to nearly singular linear systems that are row rank-deficient. We introduce a new concept of nearly singular property by treating the row space as an unstable subspace in the Grassman manifold. We then define a related important space called the approximate kernel, based on which a robust kernel-augmented Kaczmarz (KaK) is introduced via the subspace correction framework and analyzed by the well-known Xu--Zikatanov identity. To get an implementable version, we further introduce the approximate dual kernel and transform KaK into an equivalent kernel-augmented coordinate descent. Furthermore, we develop an accelerated variant and establish the improved rate of convergence matching the optimal complexity of first-order methods. Compared with existing methods, ours achieve uniform convergence rates for nearly singular linear systems, and the robustness has been confirmed by some numerical tests.",

    "title": "Non-Extreme Individual Minima for Improved Pareto Front Sampling Efficiency and Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "In multi-objective optimization, the set of optimal trade-offs -- the Pareto front -- often contains regions that are extremely steep or flat. The Pareto optimal points in these regions are typically of limited interest for decision-making, as the marginal rate of substitution is extreme: a marginal improvement in one objective necessitates a significant deterioration in at least one other objective. These unfavorable trade-offs frequently occur near the individual minima, where single objectives attain their minimum values without considering the remaining criteria.\n  To address this, we propose the concept of \\emph{non-extreme individual minima} that relies on the notion of $L$-practical proper efficiency. These points can serve as a less sensitive replacement for \\emph{standard} individual minima in subsequent related methods. Specifically, they allow for a more practical restriction of the Pareto front sampling within a refined utopia-nadir hyperbox, provide a meaningful basis for image space normalization, and can enhance decision-making techniques, such as knee-point methods, by focusing on regions with acceptable trade-offs.\n  We provide a computationally efficient algorithm to determine these non-extreme individual minima by solving at most $2n_J$ standard weighted-sum scalarizations, where $n_J$ is the number of objectives. To ensure robustness across varying objective scales, the method incorporates an integrated image space normalization strategy. Numerical examples, specifically a convex academic case and a non-convex real-world application, demonstrate that the method successfully excludes practically irrelevant regions in the image space.",

We prove that the joint distribution of the numbers of particles near the outposts converges to a multidimensional Heine distribution. Our results reveal a interesting phenomenon: although the outposts are geometrically disconnected, the particle count near each outpost is strongly correlated with the particle counts near all other outposts, not only the nearest ones (provided the outposts are not separated by a component of the droplet).",

We characterize an oracle modality as the least one forcing the given predicate. We establish an adjoint retraction between modalities and propositional containers, from which it follows that every modality is an oracle modality. The left adjoint maps sums to suprema, which makes suprema of modalities easy to compute when they are given in terms of oracle modalities. We also study sheaves for oracle modalities. We describe sheafification in terms of a quotient-inductive type of computation trees, and describe sheaves as algebras for the corresponding monad. We also introduce equifoliate trees, an intensional notion of oracle computation given by a (non-propositional) container. Equifoliate trees descend to sheaves, and lift from sheaves in case the container is projective.

In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs).\n  For each of these two families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes.

We derive general recurrence relations for cluster variables arising from flips of a triangulation, corresponding to specific sequences of mutations. Our approach is grounded in a detailed combinatorial analysis over the standard $n$-triangulated $m$-gon (with explicit calculations for $n=1,2$). As a generalization, the non-simply-laced $G_2$ type is also considered. We prove the \"well-triangulated\" property for cluster mutations under flips, which provides a combinatorial framework for understanding the stability and transformation rules of these cluster algebra structures, and compute the monomial counts for the cluster expansion formula.",

We also prove a stratification theorem for exponential sums in families indexed by a scheme and the characters of a connected commutative algebraic group. Our method is based on Tannakian categories introduced by Gabber and Loeser. This method naturally yields fiber functors. We also prove vanishing theorems over a connected commutative algebraic group, classify the negligible sheaves, and prove relative weak propagation theorems for tori.",

    "title": "Steiner Forest for $H$-Subgraph-Free Graphs",
    "abstract": "Our main result is a full classification, for every connected graph $H$, of the computational complexity of Steiner Forest on $H$-subgraph-free graphs. To obtain this dichotomy, we establish the following new algorithmic, hardness, and combinatorial results:\n  Algorithms: We identify two new classes of graph-theoretical structures that make it possible to solve Steiner Forest in polynomial time. Roughly speaking, our algorithms handle the following cases: (1) a set $X$ of vertices of bounded size that are pairwise connected by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size, possibly together with an independent set of arbitrary size that is connected to $X$ in an arbitrary way; (2) a set $X$ of vertices of arbitrary size that are pairwise connected in a cyclic manner by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size.\n  Hardness results: We show that Steiner Forest remains NP-complete for graphs with 2-deletion set number $3$. (The $c$-deletion set number is the size of a smallest cutset $S$ such that every component of $G-S$ has at most $c$ vertices.)\n  Combinatorial results: To establish the dichotomy, we perform a delicate graph-theoretic analysis showing that if $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, then excluding $H$ as a subgraph either yields one of the two algorithmically favourable structures described above, or yields a graph class for which NP-completeness of Steiner Forest follows from either our new hardness result or a previously known one.\n  Along the way to classifying the hardness for excluded subgraphs, we establish a dichotomy for graphs with $c$-deletion set number at most $k$. Specifically, our results together with pre-existing ones show that Steiner Forest is polynomial-time solvable if (1) $c=1$ and $k\\geq 0$, or (2) $c=2$ and $k\\leq 2$, or (3) $c\\geq 3$ and $k=1$, and is NP-complete otherwise.",

Determining effective upper bounds on the cohomological dimension in terms of topological invariants of $\\text{Spec}(A/I)$ is a central problem in commutative algebra. In equal characteristic, Faltings proved in 1980 a general bound on the cohomological dimension of an ideal in terms of its big height. In this article, we extend Faltings' result to the unramified mixed characteristic setting and show that the resulting bound is sharp.",

    "abstract": "A theta divisor on the universal principally polarised abelian variety can be extended to a compactification either by taking the Zariski closure, or by taking the unique extension which is pure of weight 2. For the latter, following ideas of Yuan and Zhang, we need to pass to the category of adelic- or b-divisors. We show that the two choices of extension differ by a tropicalisation of the Riemann theta function. We prove an extension of Moret-Bailly's ''key formula'' that features the pure weight 2 extension of the theta divisor, and discuss various arithmetic applications, including a ''universal'' formula for the N\u00e9ron--Tate height of a point. A key technical input is the systematic use of the theory of logarithmic abelian varieties due to Kajiwara, Kato, and Nakayama.",

    "title": "Multichannel Conflict-Avoiding Codes for Expanded Scenarios",
    "abstract": "A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) of length L and weight w is used for deterministic multiple-access without feedback. When the number of simultaneous active users is less than or equal to w, such a code is able to provide a hard guarantee that each active user has a successful transmission within every consecutive L time slots. Recently, CACs were extended to multichannel CAcs (MC-CACs) over M orthogonal channels with the aim of increasing the number of potential users that can be supported. While most existing results on MC-CAC are derived under the assumption that M is not less than w, this paper focuses on the case that M is less than w, which is more relevant to practical application scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of exceptional codewords in MC-CACs. By employing some techniques from additive combinatorics, we derive a series of optimal MC-CACs. Along the way, several previously known optimal CAC results are generalized. Finally, our results extend naturally to AM-OPPTS MC-CACs and mixed-weight MC-CACs, two classes of relevant codes.",

    "title": "A Polyhedral Study on Unit Commitment with a Single Type of Binary Variables",
    "abstract": "Efficient power production scheduling is a crucial concern for power system operators aiming to minimize operational costs. Previous mixed-integer linear programming formulations for unit commitment (UC) problems have primarily used two or three types of binary variables. The investigation of strong formulations with a single type of binary variables has been limited, as it is believed to be challenging to derive strong valid inequalities using fewer binary variables, and the reduction of the number of binary variables is often accompanied by a compromise in tightness. To address these issues, this paper considers a formulation for unit commitment using a single type of binary variables and develops strong valid inequality families to enhance the tightness of the formulation. Conditions under which these strong valid inequalities serve as facet-defining inequalities for the single-generator UC polytope are provided. For those large-size valid inequality families, the existence of efficient separation algorithms for determining the most violated inequalities is also discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed single-binary formulation and strong valid inequalities is demonstrated through computational experiments on network-constrained UC problems. The results indicate that the strong valid inequalities presented in this paper are effective in solving UC problems and can also be applied to UC formulations that contain more than one type of binary variables.",
