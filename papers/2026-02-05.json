    "title": "Basis Criteria for Extending Generalized Splines",
    "abstract": "Let $R$ be a commutative ring with identity and $G$ a graph. Extending generalized splines are a further extension of generalized splines by allowing vertex labels of $G$ to lie in varying modules rather than in a fixed ring $R$. Geometrically, this corresponds to the construction of equivariant cohomology by Braden and MacPherson (see [5]). Therefore, characterizing such splines has immediate implications in geometry, particularly in the computation of equivariant cohomology.\n  In this paper, we study extending generalized splines as a $R$- module in which each vertex $v$ is labeled by $M_v = m_v R$ and each edge $e$ is labeled by $M_e = R/r_e R$ together with quotient $R$-module homomorphisms $M_v\\to M_e$ for each vertex $v$ incident to the edge $e$, where $R$ is a greatest common divisor domain (GCD). We characterize module bases of such splines in terms of determinants so that it provides a criterion for freeness of spline modules.",

    "abstract": "We study discrete statistical mechanics systems perturbed by a random environment without a finite second moment. Specifically, we consider a random environment whose tail distribution satisfies $P[\u03c9> x] \\sim x^{-\u03b3}$ as $x \\to +\\infty$ for some $\u03b3\\in (1,2)$. Inspired by the seminal work of Caravenna, Sun and Zygouras \\cite{csz_2016}, we adopt a general framework that encompasses as key examples both the disordered pinning model and the long-range directed polymer model. We provide some subcriticality condition under which we prove that the discrete disordered system possesses a non-trivial scaling limit. We also interpret the subcriticality condition in terms of a generalized Harris criterion without second moment, which gives a prediction for disorder relevance depending on the parameters of the system. Our analysis relies on the study of multilinear polynomials of independent heavy-tailed random variables known as polynomial chaos and their continuous analogue, given by multiple integrals with respect to a $\u03b3$-stable L\u00e9vy white noise. We develop precise and flexible moments estimates adapted to the heavy-tailed setting.",

Using the Hopf-Lax representation of the Parisi formula, we construct explicit counterexamples within the class of mixed \\(p\\)-spin models. In particular, we exhibit a model in which the classical AT perturbation is performed around the unique minimizer of the RS free energy, and prove that even in this setting, the AT criterion fails to characterize the RS phase.

    "title": "On the pure traction problem of linear elasticity: a regularized formulation and its robust approximation",
    "abstract": "The pure traction problem of elasticity appears frequently in engineering applications, and its complexity stems from the fact that its solution is unique only up to (infinitesimal) rigid body motions. When finite elements are employed to approximate this problem, one solution is typically singled out by applying carefully selected boundary conditions on the discrete model or by imposing global constraints on the deformation. However, neither of these strategies is both simple and computationally efficient. In this work, we propose a new approach to solving the pure traction problem that overcomes existing limitations. Our method builds on a regularized form of the problem whose solution is shown to be unique, converges to the original solution of minimal norm, and can be approximated with finite elements in a straightforward way, without additional degrees of freedom. Additionally, we analyze the situation in which the approximation of the solution domain renders the loading of the discretized problem non-equilibrated, making the problem ill-posed. In this case, we propose a regularized predictor--corrector finite element formulation that handles the incompatibilities of the loading, providing a solution that converges to that of the original Neumann problem as the mesh size and the regularizing parameter tend to zero. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for representative problems in mechanics where pure traction boundary conditions appear.",

    "title": "Lattices with congruence densities larger than $3/32$",
    "abstract": "By a 1997 result of R. Freese, an $n$-element lattice has at most $2^{n-1}$ congruences. This motivates us to define the congruence density cd$(L)$ of a finite $n$-element lattice as $|$Con$(L)|/2^{n-1}$, where $|$Con$(L)|$ is the number of elements of the congruence lattice Con$(L)$ of $L$. We prove that whenever $L$ is a finite lattice with cd$(L)>3/32$, then $L$ has the same number of join-irreducible and meet-irreducible elements. This result is sharp, since there exists a six-element lattice $R_6$ with cd$(R_6)=3/32$ but fewer join-irreducible than meet-irreducible elements. By R. Freese, C. Mure\u015fan, J. Kulin, and the present author's results, lattices with congruence densities larger than $1/8$ have already been described. Here we decrease the lower threshold from $1/8$ to $3/32$. That is, we describe all finite lattices $L$ such that cd$(L)>3/32$. As a corollary, we give the $k$th largest number of congruences of $n$-element lattices for $n>8$ and $k\\in\\{n+1, n+2, n+3,n+4\\}$.",

    "title": "Sampled-Data Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Control of Multiplicative Systems: A Convex Relaxation with Performance Guarantees",
    "abstract": "This paper investigates the robust optimal control of sampled-data stochastic systems with multiplicative noise and distributional ambiguity. We consider a class of discrete-time optimal control problems where the controller \\emph{jointly} selects a feedback policy and a sampling period to maximize the worst-case expected concave utility of the inter-sample growth factor. Modeling uncertainty via a Wasserstein ambiguity set, we confront the structural obstacle of~``concave-max'' geometry arising from maximizing a concave utility against an adversarial distribution. Unlike standard convex loss minimization, the dual reformulation here requires a minimax interchange within the semi-infinite constraints, where the utility's concavity precludes exact strong duality. To address this, we utilize a general minimax inequality to derive a tractable convex relaxation. Our approach yields a rigorous lower bound that functions as a probabilistic performance guarantee. We establish an explicit, non-asymptotic bound on the resulting duality gap, proving that the approximation error is uniformly controlled by the Lipschitz-smoothness of the stage reward and the diameter of the disturbance support. Furthermore, we introduce necessary and sufficient conditions for \\emph{robust viability}, ensuring state positivity invariance across the entire ambiguity set. Finally, we bridge the gap between static optimization and dynamic performance, proving that the optimal value of the relaxation serves as a rigorous deterministic floor for the asymptotic average utility rate almost surely. The framework is illustrated on a log-optimal portfolio control problem, which serves as a canonical instance of multiplicative stochastic control.",

Central to our inversion scheme is the construction of indicator functions, defined pointwise over the spatial and temporal sampling variables. The proposed inversion scheme permits the recovery of the $\u0398$-convex support domain from far-field data at sparse observation directions. Uniqueness in determining the convex hull of the support and the excitation instants-using all observation directions-is also established as a direct consequence of the factorization method. The effectiveness and feasibility of the approach are examined through comprehensive numerical simulations in two and three dimensions.",

When the number $N$ of particles goes to infinity and the diameter $\\varepsilon$ of the particles goes to zero, and under the weak density assumption $N\\varepsilon^2=1$, it has been known since the work of Lanford that the empirical measure for the particles converges to the solution of the Boltzmann equation in a short time interval. In particular, the particles remain dynamically independent, in this limit and in the short time interval where the correlations induced by their collisions remain under control. In a recent work, Y. Deng, Z. Hani and X. Ma successfully obtained the same convergence result in arbitrary large time; more precisely, the convergence result holds for any time interval on which the Boltzmann equation has a regular solution. In this note, we explain a few elements of their proof.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish the global well-posedness of the incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system on $n-$dimensional $(n\\geq 2)$ periodic boxes with either no magnetic diffusivity (non-resistive case) or no fluid viscosity (non-viscous case) under assumption that initial magnetic fields are sufficiently close to the background magnetic field ${\\bf e}_n=(0,\\cdots,0,1)$. In Eulerian coordinates, we develop novel time-weighted energy estimates and commutator estimates involving Riesz transforms in negative Sobolev spaces to handle two distinct dissipation cases under different initial symmetry assumptions. The analysis becomes much more difficult and delicate in three- or higher-dimensional cases. In particular, for the three-dimensional and non-resistive case, compared with the regularity requirement proposed by Pan, Zhou and Zhu {\\it [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 2018]}, our result relaxes it from $H^{11}(\\mathbb{T}^3)$ to $H^{\\frac{9}{2}+}(\\mathbb{T}^3)$. And we further establish precise decay rates and growth bounds for both $u(t)$ and $\\partial_n(u(t),b(t))$ in Sobolev norms. For the three-dimensional and non-viscous case, we prove the first nonlinear stability result near the background field $\\mathbf{e}_3 = (0,0,1)$.

We derive a uniform lower bound for the large-degree and large-genus logarithmic asymptotics of these combinatorial invariants. This uniform lower bound yields the following results: (1) We establish a uniform lower bound for the large-degree and large-genus logarithmic asymptotics of real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues. In particular, we provide a partial answer to an open question proposed by Dubrovin, Yang and Zagier on the uniform bound for simple Hurwitz numbers. (2) We prove logarithmic equivalence between real double Hurwitz numbers with triple ramification and their complex analogues as the degree tends to infinity and only simple branch points are added.

To this end, firstly, we introduce a fully implicit time semi-discrete approximation and a fully discrete approximation for an appropriate weak formulation of the thermodynamically consistent model. Next, by using the zeros of a vector field theorem, we prove the existence of the weak solution for the fully discrete approximation. Then the existence of weak solutions for the fully implicit time semi-discrete approximation and the weak formulation of the model are derived by the weak convergence technique and the energy stability estimate. Subsequently, by the Gr{\\\" o}nwall inequality, we prove the uniqueness result under the smoothness assumption on the chemical potential.

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel outer approximation algorithm for nonsmooth mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problems. The method proceeds by fixing the integer variables and solving the resulting nonlinear convex subproblem. When the subproblem is feasible, valid linear cuts are derived by computing suitable subgradients of the objective and constraint functions at the optimal solution, utilizing KKT optimality conditions. A new parameter, defined through the nonlinear constraint functions, is introduced to facilitate the generation of these cuts. For infeasible subproblems, a feasibility problem is solved, and valid linear cuts are generated via KKT-based subgradients to exclude the infeasible integer assignment.\n  By integrating both types of cuts, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) master problem is formulated and proven equivalent to the original MINLP. This equivalence underpins a new outer approximation algorithm, which is guaranteed to terminate after a finite number of iterations.\n  Numerical experiments on smooth convex MINLP problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm produces tighter MILP relaxations than the classical outer approximation method. Furthermore, the approach offers an alternative mechanism for generating linear cuts, extending beyond reliance solely on first-order Taylor expansions and shows that the efficiency of outer approximation algorithm is strongly dependent on the inherent structure of the MINLP problem.",

We show that the first type of stabilization gives a new characterization of the class of language stable shifts and demonstrates that there is a mechanism for producing a characteristic measures that relies only on entropy differences.

This spectral theory extends to Clifford operators. A key distinction from classical complex spectral theory lies in the definition of the $S$-spectrum, which is second order in the operator $T$, and in the $S$-resolvent operators that turns out to be the product of two different operators.

This modified model, obtained through a specific asymptotic scaling accessible only within the stochastic framework, captures non-hydrostatic effects while remaining within the primitive equations formalism. The resulting generalized hydrostatic model has been shown to be well-posed when the additional terms are regularized using a suitable filter for divergence-free noises under suitable assumptions.

Specifically, we consider the Gram matrices $\\mathbf S_n=\\mathbf Y_n\\mathbf Y_n^*$, where the entries of $\\mathbf Y_n$ are independent, centered, heteroscedastic, and sparse through Bernoulli masking. The sparsity level is parameterized as $s=q^2/n$, with $q$ ranging from polynomial order to order $n^{1/2}$.\n  We investigate two asymptotic regimes in a high-dimensional framework: a moderate-sparsity regime with fixed $s\\in(0,1]$, and a high-sparsity regime where $s\\to0$. In both regimes, we establish the convergence of the empirical spectral distribution of $\\mathbf S_n$ to a deterministic limit, and further derive central limit theorems for linear spectral statistics using resolvent techniques and martingale difference arguments. Our analysis reveals a phase transition in the fluctuation behavior across the two regimes. In the high-sparsity regime, the asymptotic fluctuations are governed by fourth-moment effects, with sparsity-scaled contributions being suppressed. Moreover, a mismatch between the scaling of the mean and variance, of different orders in $q$, necessitates an explicit correction in the centering of the linear spectral statistic. The theory applies to both Gaussian and non-Gaussian entries, and its statistical utility is illustrated through applications to hypothesis testing and outage probability analysis in large-scale MIMO systems.",

We propose a modified mixed formulation that decomposes the problem into a system of Poisson equations, where the number of equations depends on both the largest interior angle and the boundary conditions on its two adjacent sides. In contrast to the naive mixed formulation, which involves only two Poisson problems, the proposed approach guarantees convergence to the true solution for arbitrary polygonal domains and general boundary conditions, including Navier, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions. $C^0$ finite element algorithms are developed, rigorous error estimates are established, and numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the well-posedness and effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "This paper, commissioned as a survey of the Riemann Hypothesis, provides a comprehensive overview of 165 years of mathematical approaches to this fundamental problem, while introducing a new perspective that emerged during its preparation. The paper begins with a detailed description of what we know about the Riemann zeta function and its zeros, followed by an extensive survey of mathematical theories developed in pursuit of RH -- from classical analytic approaches to modern geometric and physical methods. We also discuss several equivalent formulations of the hypothesis. Within this survey framework, we present an original contribution in the form of a \"Letter to Riemann,\" using only mathematics available in his time. This letter reveals a method inspired by Riemann's own approach to the conformal mapping theorem: by extremizing a quadratic form (restriction of Weil's quadratic form in modern language), we obtain remarkable approximations to the zeros of zeta. Using only primes less than 13, this optimization procedure yields approximations to the first 50 zeros with accuracies ranging from $2.6 \\times 10^{-55}$ to $10^{-3}$. Moreover we prove a general result that these approximating values lie exactly on the critical line. Following the letter, we explain the underlying mathematics in modern terms, including the description of a deep connection of the Weil quadratic form with the world of information theory. The final sections develop a geometric perspective using trace formulas, outlining a potential proof strategy based on establishing convergence of zeros from finite to infinite Euler products. While completing the commissioned survey, these new results suggest a promising direction for future research on Riemann's conjecture.",

We demonstrate that the resulting software's compiler-based tooling is transparent to the user, requiring no changes from interfaces required to use standard explicit Runge-Kutta methods, while achieving better run time performance. In addition, we also developed a comprehensive adaptive time and order algorithm that uses different step size and polynomial degree across the integration period, which makes this implementation more efficient and versatile in a broad range of dynamics. We show that for codes compatible with compiler transformations, these integrators are more efficient and robust than the traditionally used explicit Runge-Kutta methods.",

Yet Stalnaker has repeatedly emphasized the philosophical importance of viewing selection functions as functions on propositions, and many of the applications of his theory require this. Can their completeness result be extended to a selection function semantics in which the functions take propositions as arguments? We prove the answer is negative: Their logic is frame incomplete. Moreover, this result is invariant with respect to many choice points regarding the semantics, such as variable vs.~constant domains or whether to include an identity or existence predicate.

Instead of encoding data through representable integers, the proposed protocol embeds information into the gap structure of carefully chosen symmetric numerical semigroups. Symmetry guarantees a balanced gap density, ensuring that encoded values are statistically indistinguishable from uniform numerical noise to an observer lacking the private generating set. The security of the scheme relies on the assumed average-case hardness of numerical semigroup membership inference for hidden generators, offering a novel number-theoretic primitive for covert communication and post-quantum resilient information hiding.",

The model extends the previous model with incorporating strong Allee affects in the normal-tissue and tumor dynamics. Under mild assumptions, we establish global-in-time existence and uniqueness of nonnegative weak solutions and derive L-infinity bounds for all time. We then investigate spatiotemporal dynamics of the model and therapy scheduling using an implicit Crank Nicolson Backward Euler (CNBE) scheme. Simulations in a heterogeneous two-dimensional space-dimensional tissue region with three tumor peaks indicate rapid tumor invasion without treatment and significant tumor suppression under pulsed chemotherapeutic treatment. Moreover, in a fixed total dose delivered within the treatment cycle, while keeping each injection duration fixed, concentrated pulses produce stronger early knock-down of tumor density, while more frequent but gentler pulses achieve comparable control of the tumor invasive front while better preserving normal tissue over a four-week period.",

Recent work of Gaetz-Gao (2025) connects these objects to Schubert calculus and resolves the enumeration for $n=3$ and arbitrary depth $N$. However, the enumerative behavior for general $n$ has remained open.\n  In this paper, we analyze the complementary regime: fixed depth $N=2$ and arbitrary number of colors $n$. We prove that in this setting, colored interlacing triangles are in bijection with Dumont derangements, identifying their enumeration with the Genocchi medians. This connects the probabilistic model to a rich hierarchy of classical combinatorial objects.\n  Furthermore, we introduce a $q$-deformation of this enumeration arising naturally from the LLT transition energy. This yields new $q$-analogs of the Genocchi medians.

Our model is a modification of the Wright-Fisher model with seed bank, introduced by Kaj, Krone and Lascoux. We distinguish between wild type individuals, producing only nondormant seeds, and mutants, producing seeds with dormancy. To understand how changing population size shapes the establishment of seed banks, we analyse the process under a diffusive scaling. The results support the biological insight that seed banks are favoured in a declining population, and disfavoured if population size is constant or increasing. The surprise is that this is true even when population sizes are changing very slowly -- over evolutionary timescales. We also investigate the influence of short-term fluctuations, such as annual variations in rainfall or temperature. Mathematically, our analysis reduces to a stochastic dynamical system forced onto a manifold by a large drift, which converges under scaling to a diffusion on the manifold. Inspired by the Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction, we derive an explicit formula for the limiting diffusion coefficients by projecting the system onto its linear counterpart. This provides a general framework for deriving diffusion approximations in models with strong drift and nonlinear constraints.",

The main goal in defining them was as a means of generating orientable sequences, which have automatic position location applications, although they are potentially of interest in their own right. In this paper we develop new upper bounds on the period of negative orientable sequences, which are significantly sharper then the previous known bound for n>2. The approach used to develop the new bounds involves examining the nodes in the subgraph of the de Bruijn graph corresponding to a negative orientable sequence, and to consider the implications of the fact that the in-degree of every vertex in this subgraph must equal the out-degree. However, despite improving the bounds, a gap remains between the largest known period for a negative orientable sequence and the corresponding bounds for every n>2.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Cauchy problem to the axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations. To prove an existence of global regular solutions we examine the Navier-Stokes equations near the axis of symmetry and far from it separately. We derive only a global a priori estimate. To show it near the axis of symmetry we need the energy estimate, $L_\\infty$-estimate for swirl, $H^2$ and $H^3$ estimates for the modified stream function (stream function divided by radius) and also expansions of velocity and modified stream function found by Liu-Wang. The estimate for solutions far from the axis of symmetry follows easily. Hence, having so regular solutions that Liu-Wang expansions hold we have the global a priori estimate $(\u03a9=\\mathbb{R}^3)$ $$ \\|\u03c9_{r/r} \\|_{V(\u03a9^t)} + \\|\u03c9_{\\varphi/r}\\|_{V(\u03a9^t)}\\le\u03c6({\\rm data}),\\ \\ t<\\infty, \\qquad(*) $$ where $\u03c9_r$ is the radiar component of vorticity, $\u03c9_\\varphi$ the angular, $V(\u03a9^t)$ is the energy norm. Estimate $(*)$ can be treated as an a priori estimate derived on sufficiently regular solutions. Increasing regularity of solutions $(*)$ we derive the estimate $$\\eqalign{ &\\|v\\|_{W_3^{3,3/2}(\u03a9^t)}+\\|\\nabla p\\|_{W_3^{1,1/2}(\u03a9^t)}\\cr &\\le\u03c6(\u03c6({\\rm data}),\\|f\\|_{W_3^{1,1/2}(\u03a9^t)},\\|v(0)\\|_{W_3^{3-2/3}(\u03a9)}),\\cr} \\qquad(**) $$ where $\u03c6$ is an increasing positive function. The estimate is proved on the local solution. Estimate $(**)$ plus existence of local solutions imply the existence of global regular solutions to the Cauchy problem.",

    "abstract": "Support for arithmetic in multiple precisions and number formats is becoming increasingly common in emerging high-performance architectures. From a computational scientist's perspective, our goal is to determine how and where we can safely exploit mixed precision computation in our codes to improve performance. One case where the use of low precision is natural, common in computational science, is when there are already other significant sources of ``inexactness'' present, e.g., discretization error, measurement error, or algorithmic approximation error. In such instances, analyzing the interaction of these different sources of inexactness can give insight into how the precisions of various computations should be chosen in order to ``balance'' the errors, potentially improving performance without a noticeable decrease in accuracy. We present a few recent examples of this approach which demonstrate the potential for the use of mixed precision in numerical linear algebra and matrix computations.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of estimating the value function of discrete-time switched systems under arbitrary switching. Unlike the switched LQR problem, where both inputs and mode sequences are optimized, we consider the case where switching is exogenous. For such systems, the number of possible mode sequences grows exponentially with time, making the exact computation of the value function intractable. This motivates the development of tractable bounds that approximate it. We propose a novel framework, based on path-complete graphs, for constructing computable upper bounds on the value function. In this framework, multiple quadratic functions are combined through a directed graph that encodes dynamic programming inequalities, yielding convex and sound formulations. For example, for switched linear systems with quadratic cost, we derive tractable LMI-based formulations and provide computational complexity bounds. We further establish approximation guarantees for the upper bounds and show asymptotic non-conservativeness using concepts from graph theory. Finally, we extend the approach to controller synthesis for systems with affine control inputs and demonstrate its effectiveness on numerical examples.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new approach to perform the boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (BDCA) on non-smooth and non-convex problems involving the difference of convex (DC) functions. The recently proposed BDCA uses an extrapolation step from the point computed by the classical DC algorithm (DCA) via a line search procedure in a descent direction to get an additional decrease of the objective function and accelerate the convergence of DCA. However, when the first function in DC decomposition is non-smooth, the direction computed by BDCA can be ascent and a monotone line search cannot be performed. In this work, we proposed a monotone improved boosted difference of convex functions algorithm (IBDCA) for certain types of non-smooth DC programs, namely those that can be formulated as the difference of a possibly non-smooth function and a smooth one. We show that any cluster point of the sequence generated by IBDCA is a critical point of the problem under consideration and that the corresponding objective value is monotonically decreasing and convergent. We also present the global convergence and the convergent rate under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. The applications of IBDCA in image recovery show the effectiveness of our proposed method. The corresponding numerical experiments demonstrate that our IBDCA outperforms DCA and other state-of-the-art DC methods in both computational time and number of iterations.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study a class of composite optimization problems whose objective function is given by the summation of a general smooth and nonsmooth component, together with a relatively simple nonsmooth term. While restart strategies are commonly employed in first-order methods to achieve optimal convergence under strong convexity, they introduce structural complexity and practical overhead, making algorithm design and nesting cumbersome. To address this, we propose a \\emph{restart-free} stochastic gradient sliding algorithm that eliminates the need for explicit restart phases when the simple nonsmooth component is strongly convex. Through a novel and carefully designed parameter selection strategy, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves an $\u03b5$-solution with only $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(\\frac{1}\u03b5))$ gradient evaluations for the smooth component and $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}\u03b5)$ stochastic subgradient evaluations for the nonsmooth component, matching the optimal complexity of existing multi-phase (restart-based) methods. Moreover, for the case where the nonsmooth component is structured, allowing the overall problem to be reformulated as a bilinear saddle-point problem, we develop a restart-free accelerated stochastic gradient sliding algorithm. We show that the resulting method requires only $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(\\frac{1}\u03b5))$ gradient computations for the smooth component while preserving an overall iteration complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt\u03b5})$ for solving the corresponding saddle-point problems.

While truncation error in such expansions has been extensively studied, practical models frequently involve an additional source of error arising from the approximation of coefficient functions when closed-form expressions are unavailable. The combined effect of these two errors remains insufficiently addressed in the literature. Building on the author's earlier work on reliability and accuracy estimates for $\\varphi$-sub-Gaussian processes, this paper extends the methodology to orthonormal polynomial systems that do not possess normalized generating functions in analytical form, including the Legendre, generalized Laguerre, and Gegenbauer families. New bounds are derived for models in $L_p(T)$ and $C([0,T])$ that simultaneously account for truncation and coefficient approximation. The resulting criteria provide practical guidance for selecting the number of series terms required to achieve prescribed levels of reliability and accuracy across a broader class of polynomial-based stochastic process models.",

    "abstract": "We establish rigorously the equivalence between classical moment closure and a nonlinear variational approximation of the Fokker-Planck equation for dilute polymeric flow in the linearized Hookean spring chain setting. The variational formulation is based on the Dirac-Frankel principle applied to a Gaussian approximation manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao information metric. We show that the invariance of this manifold under the linear configurational dynamics yields an exact evolution for the macroscopic conformation tensor, recovering the classical diffusive Oldroyd-B closure. While the equivalence only holds in the linearized setting, the associated variational framework provides an abstract error representation and a starting point for the systematic construction of reduced approximation schemes for polymeric flows with nonlinear forcing laws.",

    "abstract": "In the current work we present a spectral analysis of the additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods within the framework of domain decomposition techniques, by investigating the spectral properties of these classical Schwarz preconditioning matrix-sequences, with emphasis on their convergence behavior and on the effect of transmission operators. In particular, after a general presentation of various options, we focus on restricted variants of the Schwarz methods aimed at improving parallel efficiency, while preserving their convergence features. In order to rigorously describe and analyze the convergence behavior, we employ the theory of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences, which provides a robust framework for studying the asymptotic spectral distribution of the discretized operators arising from Schwarz iterations. By associating each operator sequence with the appropriate GLT symbol, we derive explicit expressions for the GLT symbols of the convergence factors, for both additive and multiplicative Schwarz methods. The GLT-based spectral approach offers a unified and systematic understanding of how the spectrum evolves with mesh refinement and overlap size (in the algebraic case). Our analysis not only deepens the theoretical understanding of classical Schwarz methods, but also establishes a foundation for examining future restricted or hybrid Schwarz variants using symbolic spectral tools. These results enable the prediction of the remarkable efficiency of block Jacobi/Gauss--Seidel and block additive/multiplicative Schwarz preconditioners for GLT sequences, as further illustrated through a wide choice of numerical experiments.",

Banks and Shparlinski showed that this Gaussian convergence holds for any Beatty sequence $\\lfloor\u03b1n + \u03b2\\rfloor$ in place of $n$. Continuing in this spirit, Crn\u010devi\u0107, Hern\u00e1ndez, Rizk, Sereesuchart and Tao considered the joint distribution of $\u03c9(n)$ and $\u03c9(\\lfloor\u03b1n\\rfloor)$, which they showed to be asymptotically independent for irrational values of $\u03b1$.\n  Generalising both results, we show that for any positive integer $k$, real numbers $\u03b1_1, \\dots, \u03b1_k > 0$ and $\u03b2_1, \\dots, \u03b2_k$, where $\u03b1_i/\u03b1_j$ is irrational for $i\\neq j$, the joint distribution of $(\u03c9(\\lfloor\u03b1_in + \u03b2_i\\rfloor) - \\log\\log N)/\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}$ converges to the $k$-dimensional standard Gaussian.\n  We next discuss quantitative bounds on the rate of convergence which do not depend on the values taken by the relevant parameters. Banks and Shparlinski remarked that such quantitative bounds may be given for a single Beatty sequence $\\lfloor\u03b1n + \u03b2\\rfloor$ under Diophantine type assumptions on $\u03b1$. We show that such assumptions are in fact unnecessary. Specifically, for any real numbers $\u03b1> 0, \u03b2$, we show that the Kolmogorov distance between the random variable $(\u03c9(\\lfloor\u03b1n + \u03b2\\rfloor) - \\log\\log N)/\\sqrt{\\log\\log N}$ and the standard Gaussian is bounded above by $O(\\log\\log\\log N/\\sqrt{\\log\\log N})$ as $N$ tends to infinity.\n  On the other hand, we show that universal quantitative bounds of this kind do not exist for higher-degree generalised polynomials or for the joint convergence for multiple Beatty sequences.",

The Fukaya-Seidel categories of these abstract Lefschetz fibrations admit semiorthogonal decompositions akin to the ones described via the derived special McKay correspondence of Ishii and Ueda arXiv:1104.2381v2 [math.AG]. We apply this construction to establish an equivalence at the large volume limit between the derived category of an effective orbifold log Calabi-Yau surface with points of type $\\frac{1}{k}(1,1)$ and the Fukaya-Seidel category of its mirror Lefschetz fibration. We also compare the abstract construction to an explicit Landau-Ginzburg model defined by a Laurent polynomial associated to a toric degeneration in the case of the family of hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}\\subset \\mathbb{P}(1,1,1,k)$. The hypersurfaces $X_{k+1}$ admit a non-trivial moduli of complex structures, which we compare with an open subset of the space of symplectic structures on the total space of the mirror Landau-Ginzburg model via a mirror map built out of intrinsic quantities in a non-exact Fukaya-Seidel category.",

    "abstract": "The game of coding is a new framework at the intersection of game theory and coding theory; designed to transcend the fundamental limitations of classical coding theory. While traditional coding theoretic schemes rely on a strict trust assumption, that honest nodes must outnumber adversarial ones to guarantee valid decoding, the game of coding leverages the economic rationality of actors to guarantee correctness and reliable decodability, even in the presence of an adversarial majority. This capability is paramount for emerging permissionless applications, particularly decentralized machine learning (DeML). However, prior investigations into the game of coding have been strictly confined to scalar computations, limiting their applicability to real world tasks where high dimensional data is the norm. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the framework to the general $N$-dimensional Euclidean space. We provide a rigorous problem formulation for vector valued computations and fully characterize the equilibrium strategies of the resulting high dimensional game. Our analysis demonstrates that the resilience properties established in the scalar setting are preserved in the vector regime, establishing a theoretical foundation for secure, large scale decentralized computing without honest majority assumptions.",

On the geometric side, we use the Grojnowski-Nakajima Fock space identification to realize the ladder operator $E_1=[W_0,p_1]$ as the Hecke correspondence on $\\mathrm{Hilb}_n(\\mathbb C^2)$, and we interpret the cubic generator $W_0$ as a normal ordered triple incidence correspondence. We then explain how the $\u03b2$-deformed cubic generator $W_0^{(\u03b2)}$ arises from the Ward identities/Virasoro constraints of the Gaussian $\u03b2$-ensemble via a background charge parametrization, clarifying its conformal field theoretic meaning.

    "abstract": "We propose a combinatorial bandit formulation to opportunistically trigger sleep modes in gNode-B (gNB) small cells (SCs), followed by a cell range expansion (CRE)-based load balancing procedure. This is implemented by ensuring that the fifth generation (5G) quality of service identifier (5QI)-requirements of user equipments (UEs) are maintained. The key challenge is the fact that while deactivating a given SC gNB reduces its own consumption, it may increase the load on neighboring gNBs and the macro gNB (coverage cell), impacting the overall energy efficiency. This phenomenon is accurately characterized by modeling the dynamic cell load that jointly takes into account the location of the UEs, their relative locations to all the SCs, and their data demands. We experimentally show that the proposed combinatorial upper confidence bound (CUCB) followed by the load balancer outperforms not only the naive strategies like arbitrarily keeping all the SCs on, but also other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning solutions. The proposed algorithm can be implemented as open-radio access network (O-RAN) near-real-time (NRT) RAN intelligent controller (RIC) xApps.",

However, when the true Koopman eigenfunctions cannot be identified from finite data, multi-step predictions may suffer from structural inaccuracies and systematic bias. To address this issue, we analyse the first and second moments of the multi-step prediction residual. By decomposing the residual into contributions from the one-step approximation error and the propagation of accumulated inaccuracies, we derive a closed-form expression characterising these effects. This analysis enables the development of a novel and computationally efficient algorithm that enforces unbiasedness and reduces variance in the resulting predictor. The proposed method is validated in numerical simulations, showing improved uncertainty properties compared to standard EDMD. These results lay the foundation for uncertainty-aware and unbiased Koopman-based prediction frameworks that can be extended to controlled and stochastic systems.",

As a consequence, we obtain Darboux-type normal pictures for homogeneous forms, recovering the classical Darboux theorems, as well as their contact and presymplectic counterparts as special cases.\n  To obtain an analog of Darboux's classification in the supergeometric context, we define a class of a differential form $\u03b1$ by the rank of the characteristic distribution $\u03c7(\u03b1)$, being the intersection of kernels of $\u03b1$ and $d\u03b1$.

This resolves a conjecture of Lawler and Werner.\n  This construction produces a coupling between SLE$_2$ and Brownian motion, and we further show that this joint law is the scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk and the random walk itself. The arguments are robust and can be applied for instance in the off-critical setup, where the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk is Makarov and Smirnov's massive SLE$_2$.",

After developing the procedure of reduction and extension of scalars, we show how twisted backgrounds in type I supergravity naturally lead to Courant algebroids over the Dolbeault complex.
