Our classification shows that nontrivial such operators are highly constrained: either $g \\equiv 0$ and $f$ is arbitrary, or $g \\not\\equiv 0$ forces $f \\equiv 0$, and $g$ must take one of several rigid forms dictated by the integer shift $k$ (necessarily odd when $g(0) \\neq 0$). We prove that every Rota--Baxter operator on $W$ decomposes uniquely into even and odd homogeneous components; we restrict our attention to the odd case, which yields the full nontrivial structure. Furthermore, we show that all derivations of $W$ are inner, that no Rota--Baxter operator on $W$ is invertible, and we describe the induced super pre-Lie algebra structure together with its cohomological interpretation.",

In this paper, we describe $D_{n,r}$ using a diagrammatic calculus. Then we use a theorem of Drinfeld to compute $\\ker D_{n,r}$ when $n > r$, thereby giving a presentation of $AS(n,r)$ in these cases. We formulate a conjecture in the remaining cases.

Building on the correspondence between independent sets in the confusion graph and valid codes, we show that the color of a single vertex - consistent with a global proper coloring - can be computed in polynomial time using a modified version of Linial's coloring algorithm, leading to efficient encoding and decoding. Our results include: i) uniquely decodable code constructions for a constant number of errors of any type with redundancy twice the Gilbert-Varshamov bound; ii) list-decodable codes via a proposed extension of graph coloring, namely, hypergraph labeling; iii) an incremental synchronization scheme with reduced average-case communication when the edit distance is not precisely known; and iv) the first asymptotically optimal codes (up to a factor of 8) for correcting bursts of unbounded-length edits. Compared to syndrome compression, our approach is more flexible and generalizable, does not rely on a good base code, and achieves improved redundancy across a range of parameters.",

    "abstract": "Binomial distributions capture the probabilities of `heads' outcomes when a (biased) coin is tossed multiple times. The coin may be identified with a distribution on the two-element set {0,1}, where the 1 outcome corresponds to `head'. One can also toss two separate coins, with different biases, in parallel and record the outcomes. This paper investigates a slightly different `bivariate' binomial distribution, where the two coins are dependent (also called: entangled, or entwined): the two-coin is a distribution on the product {0,1} x {0,1}. This bivariate binomial exists in the literature, with complicated formulations. Here we use the language of category theory to give a new succint formulation. This paper investigates, also in categorically inspired form, basic properties of these bivariate distributions, including their mean, variance and covariance, and their behaviour under convolution and under updating, in Laplace's rule of succession. Furthermore, it is shown how Expectation Maximisation works for these bivariate binomials, so that mixtures of bivariate binomials can be recognised in data. This paper concentrates on the bivariate case, but the binomial distributions may be generalised to the multivariate case, with multiple dimensions, in a straightforward manner.",

Unlike existing algorithms where the adjustment coefficient is always set to 1, we establish that the range of the adjustment coefficient lies within (1/2,1] for pseudo-convex optimization problems, and [0,1] for convex optimization problems. We also provide rigorous convergence proofs for these proposed algorithms.

We formulated this problem to establish a theoretical framework that would explain the viability of data-driven prediction in quantum mechanics. In a previous work, we analysed this inverse problem for Hamiltonians of the form $-\u0394+ V$ with an electric potential $V = V({\\rm t}, {\\rm x})$, and we showed that uniqueness holds whenever the potentials are bounded and decay super-exponentially at infinity. In this paper, we extend this result for unbounded potentials. One of the key steps consists in proving a family of suitable Strichartz estimates -- including the corresponding endpoint of Keel and Tao.\n  In the context of the inverse Calder\u00f3n problem this family of inequalities corresponds to the Carleman inequality proved by Kenig, Ruiz and Sogge. Haberman showed that this inequality can be also retrieved as an embedding of a suitable Bourgain space. The corresponding Bourgain space in our context do not capture the mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces of Strichartz inequalities. In this paper, we give a counterexample that justifies this fact, and shows the limitations of Bourgain spaces to address the initial-to-final-state inverse problem.",

Here, we focus on the regularity of this map as a function of the density and the coupling constant in front of the interaction term. More precisely, we first prove a quantitative version of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, thereby showing that this map is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the natural Sobolev norms in the space of densities and potentials. In particular, this implies that the inverse (Kohn-Sham) problem is not only well-posed but also Lipschitz stable. Using this result, we then show that the density-to-potential map is in fact real analytic with respect to both the density and the interaction strength. As a consequence, we obtain a holomorphic extension of the universal constrained-search functional to a suitable subset of complex-valued densities. This partially extends the DFT framework to non-self-adjoint Schr\u00f6dinger operators.

    "abstract": "This work investigates a dynamic variant of Bayesian persuasion, in which a strategic sender seeks to influence a receiver's belief over time through controlling the timing of the information disclosure, under resource constraints. We consider a binary information source (i.e., taking values 0 or 1), where the source's state evolve according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). In this setting, the receiver aims to estimate the source's state as accurately as possible. In contrast, the sender seeks to persuade the receiver to estimate the state to be 1, regardless of whether this estimate reflects the true state. This misalignment between their objectives naturally leads to a Stackelberg game formulation where the sender, acting as the leader, chooses an information-revelation policy, and the receiver, as the follower, decides whether to follow the sender's messages. As a result, the sender's objective is to maximize the long-term average time that the receiver's estimate equals 1, subject to a total sampling constraint and a constraint for the receiver to follow the sender's messages called incentive compatibility (IC) constraint. We first consider the single-source problem and show that the sender's optimal policy is to allocate a minimal sampling rate to the undesired state 0 (just enough to satisfy the IC constraint) and assign the remaining sampling rate to the desired state 1. Next, we extend the analysis to the multi-source case, where each source has a different minimal sampling rate. Our results show that the sender can leverage the timeliness of the revealed information to influence the receiver, thereby achieving a higher utility.",

Here, we investigate the energy equality related to a suitable weak solution to the Navier-Stokes initial boundary value problem. The term suitable is meant in the sense that for our goals we achieve a weak solution whose existence is based as limit of solutions to the mollified Navier-Stokes system. In the case of a weak regularity of the solution, our results justify the possible gap for the energy equality in terms of \"kinetic energy\". However, if there is a sufficient regularity, e.g., like the continuity of the L2-norm of the weak solution, then the energy equality holds.",

    "abstract": "In the present paper, we study the outer automorphism groups of the absolute Galois groups of 2-adic local fields from the point of view of anabelian geometry. Let us recall that it is well-known that the natural homomorphism from the automorphism group of a mixed-characteristic local field to the outer automorphism group of the absolute Galois group of the given mixed-characteristic local field is injective. Moreover, Hoshi and the author of the present paper proved that, for absolutely abelian mixed-characteristic local fields with odd residue characteristic $p$ and even extension degree over ${\\mathbb Q}_p$, this subgroup arising from field automorphisms is not normal in the outer automorphism group and has infinitely many distinct conjugates. As a result in this direction, one of the main results of the present paper is the assertion that if a 2-adic local field satisfies certain conditions, then the set of conjugates of the subgroup arising from field automorhisms in the outer automorphism group is infinite, which thus implies that this subgroup is not normal in the outer automorphism group. On the other hand, for an odd prime number $p$, Hoshi proved the existence of an irreducible Hodge-Tate $p$-adic representation of dimension two of the absolute Galois group of a $p$-adic local field and an automorphism of the absolute Galois group such that the $p$-adic Galois representation obtained by pulling back the given $p$-adic Galois representation by the given automorphism is not Hodge-Tate. As a result in a direction that is different from the above direction, another main result of the present paper is the existence of a pair of a representation and an automorphism that is\n  similar to the above pair in the case where $p=2$.",

The key challenge was to avoid the exponential complexity arising from permutations of the given unordered points. For a fixed dimension of the ambient Euclidean space, the times of all algorithms for the resulting invariants and distance metrics depend polynomially on the number of points.\n  The second part of the book advances a similar classification in the much more difficult case of periodic point sets, which model all periodic crystals at the atomic scale. The most significant result is the hierarchy of invariants from the ultra-fast to complete ones. The key challenge was to resolve the discontinuity of crystal representations that break down under almost any noise. Experimental validation on all major materials databases confirmed the Crystal Isometry Principle: any real periodic crystal has a unique location in a common moduli space of all periodic structures under rigid motion. The resulting moduli space contains all known and not yet discovered periodic crystals and hence continuously extends Mendeleev's table to the full crystal universe.",

We propose a heuristic search method that replaces this by a small number of small-scale quadratic programs (QPs), or nonlinear programs (NLPs) respectively. The proposed approach provides a flexible framework in which arbitrary (data-driven) quantile estimators can be used to bound the probability of safety violations. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate improvements in conservatism and computation time with respect to existing methods, and we illustrate the flexibility of the method for modeling complex safety sets.

    "abstract": "Several researchers have developed a rich toolbox of matrix compression techniques that exploit structure and redundancy in large matrices. Classical methods such as the block low-rank format and the Fast Multipole Method make it possible to manipulate very large systems by representing them in a reduced form. Among the most sophisticated tools in this area are hierarchical matrices (H-matrices), which exploit local properties of the underlying kernel or operator to approximate matrix blocks by low-rank factors, organized in a recursive hierarchy. H-matrices offer a flexible and scalable framework, yielding nearly linear complexity in both storage and computation. Hierarchical matrix techniques, originally developed for boundary integral equations, have recently been applied to matrices stemming from the discretization of advection-dominated problems. However, their effectiveness is limited by the loss of coercivity induced by convection phenomena, where traditional methods fail. Initial work by Le Borne addressed this by modifying the admissibility criterion for structured grids with constant convection, but challenges remain for more general grids and advection fields. In this work, we propose a novel partitioning strategy based on \"convection tubes\", clusters aligned with the convection vector field. This method does not require a structured grid or constant convection, overcoming the limitations of previous approaches. We present both theoretical analyses and numerical experiments, that demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method for convection-dominated PDEs on unstructured grids. The approach builds on a P\u00e9clet-robust Caccioppoli inequality, crucial for handling convection-dominated problems.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we study locally analytic vectors in the \"partially\" completed cohomology of Shimura varieties associated with some rank $2$ unitary groups over a totally real field $F^+$ such that $F^+_v = \\mathbb{Q}_{p^2}$ for some $p$-adic places $v$ and prove a certain classicality theorem. This is a partial generalization and modification of Lue Pan's work in the modular curve case by using the works of Caraiani-Scholze, Koshikawa and Zou on mod $l$ cohomology of Shimura varieties. As applications, we prove the automorphy lifting theorem and the Breuil-M$\\mathrm{\\acute{e}}$zard conjecture in some $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_{p^2})$ cases. We will assume a technical regularity condition on Serre weights of residual representations, but we don't assume any technical condition on the properties of liftings of residual representations at $p$-adic places except Hodge-Tate regularity. It should be noted that previously, such results were known only when we assumed that $F^+_v$ is equal to $\\mathbb{Q}_p$ for any $p$-adic place $v$ of $F^+$ so that we can use the $p$-adic Langlands correspondence of $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$. Moreover, we propose a conjectural strategy to prove such results in some $\\mathrm{GL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_{p^f})$ cases.",

    "abstract": "We consider kinetic and related macroscopic equations on networks. A class of linear kinetic BGK models is considered, where the limit equation for small Knudsen numbers is given by the wave equation. Coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations are obtained from the kinetic coupling conditions via an asymptotic analysis near the nodes of the network and the consideration of coupled solutions of kinetic half-space problems. Analytical results are obtained for a discrete velocity version of the coupled half-space problems. Moreover, an efficient spectral method is developed to solve the coupled discrete velocity half-space problems. In particular, this allows to determine the relevant coefficients in the coupling conditions for the macroscopic equations\n  from the underlying kinetic network problem. These coefficients correspond to the so-called extrapolation length for kinetic boundary value problems. Numerical results show the accuracy and fast convergence of the approach. Moreover, a comparison of the kinetic solution on the network with the macroscopic solution is presented.",

Above the surface both fields are in good approximation harmonic vector fields determined by their values at the body's surface or any other surface enclosing the body. The intensity problem seeks to determine harmonic vector fields vanishing at infinity and with prescribed intensity of the field at the surface. This problem constitutes a nonlinear boundary value problem, whose general solvability is not yet established. In this paper {\\em axisymmetric} harmonic fields ${\\bf H}$ outside the unit sphere $S^2$ are studied and, given an axisymmetric H\u00f6lder continuous intensity function $I\\neq 0$ on $S^2$, the existence of infinitely many solutions of the intensity problem is proved. These solutions can more precisely be characterized as follows: fix a number $\\de \\in \\nat\\setminus \\{1 \\}$ and a meridional plane $M$ through the symmetry axis $S\\!A$, and in $M$ a unit circle $S^1$ (symmetric with respect to $S\\!A$) and, furthermore, $2\\, N$, $N \\in \\nat_0$, points $z_n \\in M$ (symmetric with respect to $S\\!A$, avoiding $S\\!A$, and outside $S^1$), then the existence of an (up to a sign) unique harmonic field ${\\bf H}$ is established that vanishes at (the axisymmetric circles piercing $M$ at) $z_n$ and nowhere else, that has intensity $I$ at $S^2$ and (exact) decay order $\\de$ at infinity. The proof is based on the solution of a nonlinear elliptic equation with discontinuous coefficients, which are, moreover, singular at the symmetry axis. Its combination with fixed boundary conditions was the basis of a recent treatment of the ``geomagnetic direction problem'' \\cite{KR22}. Here we have instead natural boundary conditions, which provide less information, and which require, therefore, in part new solution techniques and sharper estimates.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven methodologies are nowadays ubiquitous. Their rapid development and spread have led to applications even beyond the traditional fields of science. As far as dynamical systems and differential equations are concerned, neural networks and sparse identification tools have emerged as powerful approaches to recover the governing equations from available temporal data series. In this chapter we first illustrate possible extensions of the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) algorithm, originally developed for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), to delay differential equations (DDEs) with discrete, possibly multiple and unknown delays. Two methods are presented for SINDy, one directly tackles the underlying DDE and the other acts on the system of ODEs approximating the DDE through pseudospectral collocation. We also introduce another way of capturing the dynamics of DDEs using neural networks and trainable delays in continuous time, and present the training algorithms developed for these neural delay differential equations (NDDEs). The relevant MATLAB implementations for both the SINDy approach and for the NDDE approach are provided. These approaches are tested on several examples, including classical systems such as the delay logistic and the Mackey-Glass equation, and directly compared to each other on the delayed R\u00f6ssler system. We provide insights on the connection between the approaches and future directions on developing data-driven methods for time delay systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce novel approximate systems for dispersive and diffusive-dispersive equations with nonlinear fluxes. For purely dispersive equations, we construct a first-order, strictly hyperbolic approximation. Local well-posedness of smooth solutions is achieved by constructing a unique symmetrizer that applies to arbitrary smooth fluxes. Under stronger conditions on the fluxes, we provide a strictly convex entropy for the hyperbolic system that corresponds to the energy of the underlying dispersive equation. To approximate diffusive-dispersive equations, we rely on a viscoelastic damped system that is compatible with the found entropy for the hyperbolic approximation of the dispersive evolution. For the resulting hyperbolic-parabolic approximation, we provide a global well-posedness result. Using the relative entropy framework \\cite{dafermos2005hyperbolic}, we prove that the solutions of the approximate systems converge to solutions of the original equations. The structure of the new approximate systems allows to apply standard numerical simulation methods from the field of hyperbolic balance laws. We confirm the convergence of our approximations even beyond the validity range of our theoretical findings on set of test cases covering different target equations. We show the applicability of the approach for strong nonlinear effects leading to oscillating or shock-layer-forming behavior.",

Transporting this dynamic to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces yields a corresponding family of kernels that converges to the largest kernel dominated by the original one and annihilating the given subspace.

We consider the problem of brittle failure in an elastic bar previously solved in (Rosakis et al 2021). Despite the presence of a non-zero interfacial/surface energy, the third derivative of the inverse-deformation map is discontinuous at the crack faces. This is due to the presence of the inequality constraint ensuring the inverse strain is nonnegative and the orientation of matter is preserved. A change in the material location of a crack results in negative entropy production, violating the second law. Consequently, such changes are disallowed giving the irreversibility condition. The inequality constraint and the irreversibility condition limit the space of admissible variations. We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability that incorporate these restrictions. Their numerical implementation shows that all broken equilibria found in (Rosakis et al 2021) are locally stable.",

We say that $p_k(G)$ is bounded for all $\\HH$-free graphs if there exists a constant $c=c(\\HH)$ such that $p_k(G)<c$ for all such graphs $G$. Here, a graph $G$ is said to be $\\HH$-free if it contains no member of $\\HH$ as an induced subgraph. When $p$ represents the degree of a vertex, Ramsey's theorem implies that $p_0(G)$ is bounded for every $\\{K_n, E_n\\}$-free graphs, where $K_n$ and $E_n$ denote the complete graph and the edgeless graph on $n$ vertices, respectively. The connected version of Ramsey's theorem says that $p_0(G)$ is bounded for all $\\{K_n, P_n, K_{1,n}\\}$-free connected graphs, where $P_n$ and $K_{1,n}$ are the $n$-vertex path and the star with $n$ leaves. In this paper, we extend the Ramsey's theorem to $p_2(G)$ where $p$ denotes the degree, the local independent number, the local component number, and sharp degree, that is, we characterize the forbidden family of graphs $\\HH$ such that $p_2(G)$ is bounded for all (connected) $\\HH$-free graphs. Moreover, we also characterize the forbidden family of graphs $\\HH$ for which there is a constant $c=c(\\HH)$ such that $p_c(G)$ is bounded for all $\\HH$-free graphs.",

    "title": "Iterative Contact-resolving Hybrid Methods for Multiscale Contact Mechanics",
    "abstract": "Modeling contact mechanics with high contrast coefficients presents significant mathematical and computational challenges, especially in achieving strongly symmetric stress approximations. Due to the inherent nonlinearity of contact problems, conventional methods that treat the entire domain as a monolithic system often lead to high global complexity. To address this, we develop an iterative contact-resolving hybrid method by localizing nonlinear contact constraints within a smaller subdomain, while the larger subdomain is governed by a linear system. Our system employs variational inequality theory, minimization principles, and penalty methods. More importantly, we propose four discretization types within the two-subdomain framework, ranging from applying standard/mixed FEM across the entire domain to combining standard/mixed multiscale methods in the larger subdomain with standard/mixed FEM in the smaller one. % The standard finite element method and standard constraint energy minimizing generalized multiscale finite element method are simple and easy to demonstrate. By employing a multiscale reduction technique, the method avoids excessive degrees of freedom inherent in conventional methods in the larger domain, while the mixed formulation enables direct stress computation, ensures local momentum conservation, and resists locking in nearly incompressible materials. Convergence analysis and the corresponding algorithms are provided for all cases. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to validate the effectiveness of the approaches.",

The set of nonabsorbing action profiles can be partitioned into the connected components of an undirected graph, whose vertices are these profiles, with two vertices joined by an edge whenever the corresponding profiles differ in the action of a single player.

The aim is the derivation of effective models for $\\varepsilon\\to 0 $, when the thickness of the layer tends to zero. For the flow problem we consider incompressible Stokes equations with a pressure boundary condition on the top/bottom of the layer, and the transport problem is given by reaction-diffusion-advection problem with advective flow governed from the fluid velocity from the Stokes model and different scalings for the diffusion coefficient modelling low and fast diffusion in the horizontal direction. In the limit, a Darcy-type law is obtained for the Stokes flow with Darcy-velocity depending only on the derivative of the Darcy-pressure in the vertical direction. The effective equation for the transport problem is again of diffusion-advection-type including homogenized coefficients, and with advective flow given by the Darcy-velocity and only taking place in the vertical direction. In the case of slow diffusion in the vertical direction, effective diffusion only takes place in the vertical direction, where in the case of high diffusion in horizontal direction, we obtain effective diffusion in all space directions. To pass to the limit we use the method of two-scale convergence adapted to our microscopic geometry, which is based on uniform a priori estimates. Critical parts in the derivation of the macro-models are the control of the fluid pressure, for which we construct a Bogovskii-operator for thin perforated domains, as well as the strong two-scale convergence for the microscopic solution of the transport equation, necessary to pass to the limit in the advective term.",

They allow the study of the derived category of a singular variety $X$ via a triangulated category that behaves like the derived category of a smooth variety.\n  We follow these ideas to study the bounded derived category of a singular, reduced curve $C$ (with arbitrary singularities and number of components). We start by describing an explicit categorical resolution of singularities, specializing a general construction of Kuznetsov and Lunts. We prove the existence of Bridgeland stability conditions on these categories. As a consequence, we get the existence of proper, good moduli spaces of semistable objects. If the curve $C$ is irreducible, then we relate these moduli spaces to the moduli of slope-semistable torsion-free sheaves on $C$, and to the moduli of slope-semistable vector bundles on the (geometric) resolution $\\tilde{C}$. This extends classical constructions by Oda and Seshadri, Bhosle and many others.\n  Finally, we use these results to give explicit descriptions of the moduli of torsion-free sheaves on a curve with a single node, cusp, or tacnode.",

    "abstract": "Accurate channel modeling for spherical absorbing receivers is fundamental to the design of realistic molecular multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. While advanced modulation schemes have been proposed to mitigate interference, determining the channel impulse response (CIR) under arbitrary flow directions remains a challenge; existing exact solutions are restricted to either 1-D/no-drift scenarios or planar receiver geometries. Addressing this gap, we derive the first exact analytical CIR for a spherical receiver in a 3-D molecular communication system with uniform drift in an arbitrary direction. Unlike prior approximations that ignore the angle between the drift and the transmission axis, our approach utilizes the Girsanov theorem to analytically transform the hitting-time distribution from a stationary medium to a drifted one. The proposed closed-form expression not only eliminates modeling errors inherent in previous approximations for off-axis receivers but also enables efficient parameter-space exploration of critical system metrics (e.g., peak time and amplitude), a task that would be computationally costly with pure simulation-based approaches.",

We establish the well-posedness of the associated system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations and provide a characterization of the optimal policy. The policy improvement and the convergence of the policy iterations are rigorously established by analyzing the system of equations.

    "abstract": "We construct a canonical geometric rough path over $d$-dimensional tempered fractional Brownian motion (tfBm) for any Hurst parameter $H > 1/4$ and tempering parameter $\u03bb> 0$. The main challenge stems from the non-homogeneous nature of the tfBm covariance, which exhibits a power-law structure at small scales and exponential decay at large scales. Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of this covariance, proving it has finite 2D $\u03c1$-variation for $\u03c1= 1/(2H)$. This verifies the criterion of Friz and Victoir, guaranteeing the existence of a rough path lift. We then provide an explicit construction of the rough path $\\mathbf{B}_{H,\u03bb} = (B_{H,\u03bb}, \\mathbb{B}_{H,\u03bb})$ via $L^2$-limits, establishing its basic properties with explicit constants $C(H,\u03bb,T)$. As direct consequences, we obtain: (i) a complete characterization of integration regimes, with Young integration applicable for $H > 1/2$ and rough path theory necessary and sufficient for $H \\in (1/4, 1/2]$; (ii) the well-posedness of rough differential equations driven by tfBm; and (iii) the foundation for signature calculus for tfBm, including the existence and factorial decay of the signature. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical convergence rates $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-2H})$ for the L\u00e9vy area approximation and $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-H})$ for the associated Milstein scheme.

Consider a space $X\\subseteq\\mathbb{R}^d$, simulating an animal's environment, and a collection $\\mathcal{U}=\\{U_1,\\dots,U_n\\}$ of open subsets of $X$. Each $U_i\\subseteq X$ simulates a place field which is a specific region where a place cell $i$ is active.

Many studies attempted to tackle this decision problem, but only partial results were achieved. In fact, a previous study showed that the decision problem of convex neural codes is NP-hard. Furthermore, the authors of this study conjectured that every convex neural code can be realized as a minor of a neural code arising from a representable oriented matroid, which can lead to an equivalence between convex and polytope convex neural codes. Even though this conjecture has been confirmed in dimension two, its validity in higher dimensions is still unknown. To advance the investigation of this conjecture, we provide a complete characterization of the covering relations within the poset $\\mathbf{P_{Code}}$ of neural codes.",

This is the first time that Rota's classification problem for linear operators has been extended to algebras with an $n$-ary operation for $n \\ge 3$. Our work is an application of computational linear algebra to the classification problem for linear operators. We begin with a generic operator identity with indeterminate coefficients. From this we use operadic partial compositions to derive a large sparse matrix whose nonzero entries are the indeterminates. We follow the rank principle which states that significant operator identities correspond to coefficients which produce submaximal rank of the matrix. For operator identities of multiplicity 1 (each term contains the operator once) we obtain 6 families with 1 parameter, and 1 isolated solution. For multiplicity 2, we obtain 6 families with 2 parameters, 27 families with 1 parameter, and 9 isolated solutions.",

Iterating this procedure yields the result that all polyharmonic functions of sublinear growth are constant.The key innovation is a new $L^{2}$ estimate for the Laplacian of a polyharmonic function, obtained by induction through a delicate cutoff construction combined with a hole--filling argument. This provides the first sharp geometric extension of the Euclidean classification of polyharmonic functions to manifolds of nonnegative Ricci curvature, and completes a natural hierarchy of Yau--type Liouville theorems for iterates of the Laplacian.",

If the number of classes is known or approximately predictable, one can choose sufficient enough vector collection size. If one needs to significantly extend the number of classes, one can extend the collection in the same latent space, or to incorporate the collection into collection of higher dimensions with same spacing between vectors.

We use HO surface elements and interpolation functions for the discretization of the interfaces of the head volume and the unknowns on the elements, respectively. The advantage of this work over existing isoparametric HO discretization schemes resides in the fact that the interpolation points are different from the mesh nodes, allowing for the flexible manipulation of the order of the basis functions without regenerating the mesh of the interfaces. Moreover, the interpolation points are chosen from the quadrature rules with the same number of points on the elements simplifying the numerical computation of the surface integrals for the far-interaction case. In this contribution, we extend the implementation of the HO discretization scheme to the double-layer and the adjoint double-layer formulations, as well as to the isolated-skull-approach for the double-layer formulation and to the indirect adjoint double-layer formulation, employed to improve the solution accuracy in case of high conductivity contrast models, which requires the development of different techniques for the singularity treatment. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency of the proposed scheme for the four SIEs for analyzing the EEG forward problem.",

In this work we provide conditions ensuring that every function in $C^{\\infty}_{W,V}(\\mathbb{T})$, which may be highly discontinuous, admits a series expansion that generalizes the classical Taylor expansion. A central feature of our approach is that all proofs are nonstandard, since classical analytical and spectral arguments cannot be adapted to this singular setting. Using these methods we characterize the eigenvectors of $\u0394_{W,V}$ in terms of generalized trigonometric functions and obtain an asymptotic lower bound for the associated eigenvalues. We also derive a sharp upper bound for the convergence exponent of these eigenvalues, and as a consequence we prove that $C^{\\infty}_{W,V}(\\mathbb{T})$ is a nuclear space. Further consequences include results on the asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of compact operators and improvements in traceability.

    "title": "Robust Precoding Designs of RSMA for Multiuser MIMO Systems",
    "abstract": "Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has been studied for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MUMIMO) systems especially in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter. However, its precoding designs that maximize the sum rate normally have high computational complexity. To implement an efficient RSMA scheme for the MU-MIMO system, in this work, we propose a novel robust precoding design, which can handle imperfect CSI. Specifically, we first adopt the generalized mutual information to construct a lower bound of the objective function in the sum rate maximization problem. Then, we apply a smooth lower bound of the non-smooth sum rate objective function to construct a new optimization problem. By revealing the relationship between the generalized signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the minimum mean square error matrices, we transform the constructed problem into a tractable one. After decomposing the transformed problem into three subproblems, we investigate a new alternating precoding design based on sequential solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed precoding scheme achieves comparable performance to conventional methods, while significantly reducing the computational complexity.",

Corresponding Matlab (c) codes have been also made available on the internet, proving to be very competitive w.r.t. existing ones. However, so far, FHBVMs have been given for solving systems of fractional differential equations with the same order of fractional derivative, whereas the numerical solution of multi-order problems (i.e., problems in which different orders of fractional derivatives occur) has not been handled, yet. Due to their relevance in applications, in this paper we propose an extension of FHBVMs for addressing fractional multi-order problems, providing full details for such an approach. A corresponding Matlab (c) code, handling the case of two different fractional orders, is also made available, proving very effective for numerically solving these problems.",

    "title": "Weighted total variation regularization for inverse problems with significant null spaces",
    "abstract": "We consider inverse problems with large null spaces, which arise in important applications such as in inverse ECG and EEG procedures. Standard regularization methods typically produce solutions in or near the orthogonal complement of the forward operator's null space. This often leads to inadequate results, where internal sources are mistakenly interpreted as being near the data acquisition sites -- e.g., near or at the body surface in connection with EEG and ECG recordings.\n  To mitigate this, we previously proposed weighting schemes for Tikhonov and sparsity regularization. Here, we extend this approach to total variation (TV) regularization, which is particularly suited for identifying spatially extended regions with approximately constant values. We introduce a weighted TV-regularization method, provide supporting analysis, and demonstrate its performance through numerical experiments. Unlike standard TV regularization, the weighted version successfully recovers the location and size of large, piecewise constant sources away from the boundary, though not their exact shape.\n  Additionally, we explore a hybrid weighted-sparsity and TV regularization approach, which better captures both small and large sources, albeit with somewhat more blurred reconstructions than the weighted TV method alone.",

Due to the intrinsic non-associative nature of octonions, conventional linear operator theory encounters profound structural difficulties. We make use of an original conceptual framework termed para-linearity, an innovative generalization of linearity that naturally accommodates the octonionic algebraic structure. Within this newly established paradigm, we systematically develop an appropriate algebraic setting by defining a carefully designed operator algebra and an adjoint operation which, together, recapture essential analytic properties previously inaccessible in this context. We identify a geometric structure, the slice cone, as the fundamental object encoding spectral properties typically derived through sesquilinear forms. We obtain a rigorous characterization of self-adjointness which indicates how to introduce a new notion of strong eigenvalues. For every compact, para-linear, self-adjoint operator with strong eigenvalues, we can establish the spectral decomposition theorem and functional calculi.",

    "abstract": "The increasing penetration of renewable energy requires greater use of storage resources to manage system intermittency. As a result, there is growing interest in evaluating the opportunity cost of stored energy, or usage values, which can be derived by solving a multistage stochastic optimization problem. Stochasticity arises from net demand (the aggregation of demand and non-dispatchable generation), the availability of dispatchable generation, and inflows when the storage facilities considered are hydroelectric dams. We aim to compute these usage values for each market zone of the interconnected European electricity system, in the context of prospective studies currently conducted by RTE, the French TSO. The energy system is mathematically modelled as a directed graph, where nodes represent market zones and arcs represent interconnection links. In large energy systems, spatial complexity (thirty nodes in the system, each with at most one aggregated storage unit) compounds temporal complexity (a one-year horizon modelled with two timescales: weekly subproblems with hourly time steps). This work addresses three main sources of complexity: temporal, spatial, and stochastic. We tackle the multinode multistage stochastic optimisation problem by incorporating a spatio-temporal decomposition scheme. To efficiently compute usage values, we apply Dual Approximate Dynamic Programming (DADP), which enables tractable decomposition across both time and space. This approach yields nodal usage values that depend solely on the local state of each node, independently of the others. We conduct numerical studies on a realistic system composed of thirty nodes (modelling part of Europe) and show that DADP obtains competitive results when comparing with traditional methods like Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming (SDDP).",

These solutions develop a degenerate neckpinch singularity, meaning that the tangent flow at a singularity is a round cylinder, but at the same time for each of these solutions there exists a sequence of points in space and time, so that the pointed blow up limit around this sequence is the Bowl soliton. These solutions are called peanut solutions and they were first conjectured to exist by Richard Hamilton, while the existence of those solutions was shown by Angenent, Altschuler and Giga. In this paper we show that this type of solutions are highly unstable, in the sense that in every small neighborhood of any such peanut solution we can find a perturbation so that the mean curvature flow starting at that perturbation develops spherical singularity, and at the same time we can find a perturbation so that the mean curvature flow starting at that perturbation develops a nondegenerate neckpinch singularity. We also show that appropriately rescaled subsequence of any sequence of solutions whose initial data converge to the peanut solution, and all of which develop spherical singularities, converges to the Ancient oval solution.",

A breakthrough result of Allen, B\u00f6ttcher, Griffiths, Kohayakawa, and Morris determined $\u03b4_\u03c7(H)$ for every graph $H$; in particular, if $\u03c7(H)=r\\ge 3$, then $\u03b4_\u03c7(H) \\in\\{\\frac{r-3}{r-2},~\\frac{2 r-5}{2 r-3},~\\frac{r-2}{r-1}\\}$.\n  In this paper we investigate the trade-off between minimum degree and edge density in the critical window around the chromatic threshold. For a fixed graph $H$ with $\u03c7(H)=r$, allowing a constant deficit below $\u03b4_\u03c7(H)$, we prove sharp (up to lower-order terms) upper bounds on the edge density of $n$-vertex $H$-free graphs whose chromatic number diverges. Equivalently, within this degree regime we show that a suitable global bound on the number of edges forces the chromatic number to remain bounded. Our results thus quantify how global edge density can compensate for a deficit in the local minimum-degree condition near $\u03b4_\u03c7(H)$; more specifically, we obtain explicit bounds in two of the three possible cases arising in the trichotomy of $\u03b4_\u03c7(H)$.

In the case of large-scale sparse coefficient matrices and indefinite constant terms, indefinite low-rank factorizations have successfully been used to allow methods like the alternating direction implicit (ADI) iteration to efficiently compute accurate approximations to the solution of the Lyapunov equation. However, classical block-type approaches quickly increase in computational costs when the rank of the constant term grows. In this paper, we propose a novel tangential reformulation of the ADI iteration that allows for the efficient construction of low-rank approximations to the solution of Lyapunov equations with indefinite right-hand sides even in the case of constant terms with higher ranks. We provide adaptive methods for the selection of the corresponding ADI parameters, namely shifts and tangential directions, which allow for the automatic application of the method to any relevant problem setting. The effectiveness of the developed algorithms is illustrated by several numerical examples.",

In this paper, we first generalize sampling inequalities to spectral regularization, and then, by exploiting the connection between inverse problems and kernel approximation, we derive weak convergence rate bounds for inverse problems, independently of source conditions. These weak convergence rates are established and analyzed when the forward operator is compact and uniformly bounded, or the kernel operator is of trace class.",

As one application, we show that the Paley--Wiener class of functions bandlimited to $[-\u03a9,\u03a9]$ admits superexponential rates of approximation over all strictly sub-exponential distributions, which leads to a new characterization of the class.

In the prior paper we studied those invariants of Goursat distributions akin to those of curves on surfaces, which we call structural invariants. In this paper we study invariants arising from the small growth sequence of a Goursat distribution, and relate them to the the structural invariants.",

We analyze the relevant regimes of the dynamics (regular, oscillatory, onset chaotic and fully chaotic) in terms of the Fisher information and the Cr\u00e1mer-Rao (CR) complexity. We found that these informational quantifiers allow to distinguish the dynamical regions of the map, by maximizing the Fisher information in the regular behavior and with the CR complexity exhibiting variations and a maximum near to the Pomeau-Maneville scenario. Fisher information as a function of time is examined to the light of the Frieden's informational interpretation of the Thermodynamics Second Law. Finally, we apply the Equipartition Theorem to propose a definition of temperature for the logistic map, thus providing a macroscopic signature of the dynamics.",

As $r\\to 0$, we confirm that well-known hitting time results for $k$-connectivity (with $k\\ge 1$ fixed) and Hamiltonicity in the Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph process also hold for the considered geometric analogue. Moreover, we exhibit a sort of probabilistic monotonicity for each of these properties.\n  We also study a geometric analogue of the power of choice where, at each step, an agent is given two random points sampled independently and uniformly from $\\mathbb{T}^d$ and must add exactly one of them to the already constructed point set. When the agent is allowed to make their choice with the knowledge of the entire sequence of random points (offline 2-choice), we show that they can construct a connected graph at the first time $t$ when none of the first $t$ pairs of proposed points contains two isolated vertices in the graph induced by $(X_i)_{i=1}^{2t}$, and maintain connectivity thereafter. We also derive analogous results for $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity. This shows that each of the said properties can be attained two times faster (time-wise) and with four times fewer points in the offline 2-choice process compared to the 1-choice process.\n  In the online version where the agent only knows the process until the current time step, we show that $k$-connectivity and Hamiltonicity cannot be significantly accelerated (time-wise) but may be realised on two times fewer points compared to the 1-choice analogue.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces RedEigCD, the first self-adaptive timestepping technique specifically tailored for reduced-order models (ROMs) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon linear stability concepts, the method adapts the timestep by directly bounding the stability function of the employed time integration scheme using exact spectral information of matrices related to the reduced operators. Unlike traditional error-based adaptive methods, RedEigCD relies on the eigenbounds of the convective and diffusive ROM operators, whose computation is feasible at reduced scale and fully preserves the online efficiency of the ROM. A central theoretical contribution of this work is the proof, based on the combined theorems of Bendixson and Rao, that, under linearized assumptions, the maximum stable timestep for projection-based ROMs is shown to be larger than or equal to that of their corresponding full-order models (FOMs). Numerical experiments for both periodic and non-homogeneous boundary conditions demonstrate that RedEigCD yields stable timestep increases up to a factor 40 compared to the FOM, without compromising accuracy. The methodology thus establishes a new link between linear stability theory and reduced-order modeling, offering a systematic path towards efficient, self-regulating ROM integration in incompressible flow simulations.",

Specifically, we consider a communication scenario where a legitimate transmitter aims to covertly deliver information to its intended receiver through a planar FRIS, while an adversary attempts to detect whether any transmission is occurring. In this context, we analyze the false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) probabilities, and derive a closed-form expression for the covertness outage probability (COP). Furthermore, the success probability is characterized under the optimal detection threshold, providing new insights into the trade-off between covertness and reliable transmission. Numerical results reveal that FRIS provides a clear advantage over fixed-position RIS at low-to-moderate transmit powers by improving reliability and enhancing covertness, while at very high power levels, fixed-position RIS may sustain slightly higher success probability due to reduced leakage toward the adversary.",

    "abstract": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) underpins reliable and efficient wireless communication. However, acquiring CSI via pilot estimation incurs substantial overhead, especially in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems operating in high-Doppler environments. By leveraging the growing availability of environmental sensing data, this treatise investigates pilot-free channel inference that estimates complete CSI directly from multimodal observations, including camera images, LiDAR point clouds, and GPS coordinates. In contrast to prior studies that rely on predefined channel models, we develop a data-driven framework that formulates the sensing-to-channel mapping as a cross-modal flow matching problem. The framework fuses multimodal features into a latent distribution within the channel domain, and learns a velocity field that continuously transforms the latent distribution toward the channel distribution. To make this formulation tractable and efficient, we reformulate the problem as an equivalent conditional flow matching objective and incorporate a modality alignment loss, while adopting low-latency inference mechanisms to enable real-time CSI estimation. In experiments, we build a procedural data generator based on Sionna and Blender to support realistic modeling of sensing scenes and wireless propagation. System-level evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over pilot- and sensing-based benchmarks in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency for the downstream beamforming task.",

In this work, we present the first accelerated proximal bundle method that achieves the optimal $\\mathscr{O}(1/\\sqrt\u03b5)$ iteration complexity for obtaining an $\u03b5$-accurate solution in smooth convex optimization. The proposed method is conceptually simple, which differs from Nesterov's accelerated gradient descent by only a single line and retains all key structural properties of the classical PBM. In particular, it relies on the same minimal assumptions on model approximations and preserves the standard bundle testing criterion. Numerical experiments confirm the accelerated $\\mathscr{O}(1/\\sqrt\u03b5)$ convergence rate predicted by our theory.",

For such domains we show that the coefficient of $t^{1/2}$ in the expansion splits into a boundary integral of $\u03ba^2$ and a sum of local corner contributions, one for each vertex. Each curved corner contribution depends only on the interior angle $\u03b1$ and on the limiting curvatures $\u03ba_{\\pm}$ on the adjacent sides. Using a conformal model and a parametrix construction on the sector heat space, we express this contribution in the form $c_{1/2}(\u03b1)\\,r_0(\u03b1,\u03ba_+, \u03ba_-)$, where $c_{1/2}(\u03b1)$ is given by a Hadamard finite part of an explicit trace over the exact sector. For right-angled corners we compute $c_{1/2}(\u03c0/2)=1/(16\\sqrt\u03c0)$ and obtain a closed formula for the $t^{1/2}$ coefficient.

In this context, graded identities naturally arise as prominent tools, since ordinary polynomial identities can be viewed as a particular case of graded identities. Moreover, as an involution does not necessarily preserve the homogeneous components of a grading, it is natural to consider the notion of a homogeneous involution. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the codimension sequence in the setting of $G$-graded algebras endowed with a homogeneous involution. More specifically, we characterize the varieties of polynomial growth in terms of the exclusion of a list of algebras from the variety. As a consequence, we provide the classification of the varieties with almost polynomial growth in this setting.",

    "abstract": "The ability to compose acquired skills to plan and execute behaviors is a hallmark of natural intelligence. Yet, despite remarkable cross-disciplinary efforts, a principled account of how task structure shapes gating and how such computations could be delivered in neural circuits, remains elusive. Here we introduce GateMod, an interpretable theoretically grounded computational model linking the emergence of gating to the underlying decision-making task, and to a neural circuit architecture. We first develop GateFrame, a normative framework casting policy gating into the minimization of the free energy. This framework, relating gating rules to task, applies broadly across neuroscience, cognitive and computational sciences. We then derive GateFlow, a continuous-time energy based dynamics that provably converges to GateFrame optimal solution. Convergence, exponential and global, follows from a contractivity property that also yields robustness and other desirable properties. Finally, we derive a neural circuit from GateFlow, GateNet. This is a soft-competitive recurrent circuit whose components perform local and contextual computations consistent with known dendritic and neural processing motifs. We evaluate GateMod across two different settings: collective behaviors in multi-agent systems and human decision-making in multi-armed bandits. In all settings, GateMod provides interpretable mechanistic explanations of gating and quantitatively matches or outperforms established models. GateMod offers a unifying framework for neural policy gating, linking task objectives, dynamical computation, and circuit-level mechanisms. It provides a framework to understand gating in natural agents beyond current explanations and to equip machines with this ability.",

This paper proposes a remedy in the form of a type-theoretic symbolic language that enables mathematical music theorists to build and reason about musical structures more intuitively, without relinquishing the rigor of their categorical foundations. Type theory provides a syntax in which elements, functions, and relations can be expressed in simple terms, while categorical semantics supplies their mathemusical interpretation. Within this system, reasoning itself becomes constructive: propositions and proofs are treated as objects, yielding a framework in which the formation of structures and the reasoning about them take place within the same mathematical language. The result is a concise and flexible formalism that restores conceptual transparency to mathemusical thought and supports new applications, illustrated here through the theory of voice-leading spaces.",
