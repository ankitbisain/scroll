    "abstract": "We propose a bootstrap testing framework for a general class of hypothesis tests, which allows resampling under the null hypothesis as well as other forms of bootstrapping. We identify combinations of resampling schemes and bootstrap statistics for which the resulting tests are asymptotically exact and consistent against fixed alternatives. We show that in these cases the limiting local power functions are the same for the different resampling schemes. We also show that certain naive bootstrap schemes do not work. To demonstrate its versatility, we apply the framework to several examples: independence tests, tests on the coefficients in linear regression models, goodness-of-fit tests for general parametric models and for semi-parametric copula models. Simulation results confirm the asymptotic results and suggest that in smaller samples non-traditional bootstrap schemes may have advantages. This bootstrap-based hypothesis testing framework is implemented in the R package BootstrapTests.",

By discretizing this operator, we obtain a matrix approximation. Importantly, this discretization provides not only an approximating operator but also an approximating semigroup. This point motivates our approach, as we then apply Balakrishnan's representations of fractional powers of operators, which are based on semigroups. Using estimates of the semigroup norm and the norm of the difference between the operator and its matrix approximation, we derive the convergence rate for the approximation of the fractional power of operators with the fractional power of correspondings matrix operators. In addition, an explicit formula for calculating an arbitrary power of a two-band matrix is obtained, which is indispensable in the numerical solution of fractional differential and integral equations.",

    "abstract": "We establish a universal framework for concentration inequalities based on invariance under diffeomorphism groups. Given a probability measure $\u03bc$ on a space $E$ and a diffeomorphism $\u03c8: E \\to F$, concentration properties transfer covariantly: if the pushforward $\u03c8_*\u03bc$ concentrates, so does $\u03bc$ in the pullback geometry. This reveals that classical concentration inequalities -- Hoeffding, Bernstein, Talagrand, Gaussian isoperimetry -- are manifestations of a single principle of \\emph{geometric invariance}. The choice of coordinate system $\u03c8$ becomes a free parameter that can be optimized. We prove that for any distribution class $\\Pc$, there exists an optimal diffeomorphism $\u03c8^*$ minimizing the concentration constant, and we characterize $\u03c8^*$ in terms of the Fisher-Rao geometry of $\\Pc$. We establish \\emph{strict improvement theorems}: for heavy-tailed or multiplicative data, the optimal $\u03c8$ yields exponentially tighter bounds than the identity. We develop the full theory including transportation-cost inequalities, isoperimetric profiles, and functional inequalities, all parametrized by the diffeomorphism group $\\Diff(E)$. Connections to information geometry (Amari's $\u03b1$-connections), optimal transport with general costs, and Riemannian concentration are established. Applications to robust statistics, multiplicative models, and high-dimensional inference demonstrate that coordinate optimization can improve statistical efficiency by orders of magnitude.",

This work develops a numerical framework that replaces classical Gram-point bracketing with a real-to-complex parametrization of the critical line. Combined with high-precision evaluation of the Hardy Z function using the Riemann-Siegel formula with Gabcke type remainder control, this parametrization induces a Valley Scanner algorithm that identifies local minima of the absolute value of Z and refines them using safeguarded Newton iterations. The method exploits the mountain-valley geometry of the Z function rather than sign changes, and is implemented in a cloud based C language and MPFR pipeline with parallel execution on multi-core CPU instances. The paper reports Zero computations from the classical low lying range up to heights near 1e20, compares the observed spacing of zeros with Riemann - von Mangoldt predictions across several test windows, and summarizes consistency checks based on independent datasets and a local ball test. The work also introduces a fully real staircase formulation of the explicit-formula correction term for the Chebyshev function, expressed directly in terms of the zero ordinates and derived quantities.

We introduce metric-driven methods for such problems via Riemannian gradient techniques, leveraging the idea that gradients can be represented in different metrics (so-called Sobolev gradients) to accelerate convergence. We show that the choice of metric not only leads to specific metric-driven iterative schemes, but also induces approximation spaces with enhanced properties, particularly in low-regularity regimes or when the solution exhibits heterogeneous multiscale features. In fact, we recover a well-known class of multiscale spaces based on the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition (LOD), now derived from a new perspective. Alongside a discussion of the metric-driven approach for a model problem, we also demonstrate its application to simulating the ground states of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.",

Empirically, reducing the number of significant bits through rounding often leads to instances that are easier to solve. One reason can be that the amount of symmetries increases, which enables solvers to be more effective when they are exploited. This can signify that the original instance contains 'almost symmetries'. Furthermore, solving the rounded problems provides approximations to the original objective values. We empirically investigate these relations on instances of the capacitated facility location problem, the knapsack problem and a diverse collection of additional instances, using the solvers SCIP and CP-SAT. For all investigated problem classes, we show empirically that this yields faster algorithms with guaranteed solution quality. The influence of symmetry depends on the instance type and solver.",

    "abstract": "The numerical simulation of incompressible flows is challenging due to the tight coupling of velocity and pressure. Projection methods offer an effective solution by decoupling these variables, making them suitable for large-scale computations. This work focuses on reduced-order modeling using incremental projection schemes for the Stokes equations. We present both semi-discrete and fully discrete formulations, employing BDF2 in time and finite elements in space. A proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) approach is adopted to construct a reduced-order model for the Stokes problem. The method enables explicit computation of reduced velocity and pressure while preserving accuracy. We provide a detailed stability analysis and derive error estimates, showing second-order convergence in time. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate computational efficiency.",

The minimal Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the state spaces of two C$^*$-algebras is shown to correspond to the set of separable (= un-entangled) states on the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. We show that these maximal and minimal tensor product of the state spaces agree precisely when one of the two C$^*$-algebras is commutative. This confirms an old conjecture by Barker in the case where the compact convex sets are state spaces of C$^*$-algebras.\n  The Namioka-Phelps tensor product of the trace simplexes of two C$^*$-algebras is shown always to be the trace simplex of the tensor product of the C$^*$-algebras. This can be used, for example, to show that the trace simplex of (any) tensor product of two C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex if and only if the trace simplex of each of the C$^*$-algebras is the Poulsen simplex.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a primal-dual splitting algorithm for a broad class of structured composite monotone inclusions that involve finitely many set-valued operators, compositions of set-valued operators with bounded linear operators, and single-valued operators possibly without cocoercivity. The proposed algorithm is not only a unification for several contemporary algorithms but also a blueprint to generate new algorithms with graph-based structures. Our approach reduces dimensionality compared with the standard product space technique, which typically reformulates the original problem as the sum of two maximally monotone operators in order to apply splitting methods. It accommodates different cocoercive or Lipschitz constants as well as different resolvent parameters, and yields a larger allowable step-size range than in product space reformulations. We demonstrate the practicality of the approach by a numerical experiment on the decentralized fused lasso problem.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents three quantitative sampling methods for reconstructing extended sources of the biharmonic wave equation using scattered field data. The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $\u0394u^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling methods achieve high-resolution imaging of the source support or the source function itself.",

In contrast to classical results that require $b$ and $c$ to be bounded, we only assume that $b$ is bounded and $c$ satisfies a linear growth condition, while the solution $u$ is allowed to have at most exponential quadratic growth. The key innovation is a weighted $L^2$ framework that uses the backward Mehler kernel as a weight, which naturally encodes the underlying measure and compensates for the unbounded coefficients. From the frequency monotonicity, we derive the strong unique continuation principle. This extends Poon's seminal results and complements recent geometric generalizations by Colding and Minicozzi in the context of Gaussian measure spaces.

The method combines FEM's ability to provide the nodal solutions and LSSVR with higher-order Legendre polynomial kernels to deliver a closed-form analytical solution for interpolation between the nodes. The hybrid approach implements element-wise enhancement (super-resolution) of a given numerical solution, resulting in high resolution accuracy, while maintaining consistency with FEM nodal values at element boundaries. It can adapt any low-order FEM code to obtain high-order resolution by leveraging localized kernel refinement and parallel computation without additional implementation overhead. Therefore, effective inference/post-processing of the obtained super-resolved solution is possible. Evaluation results show that the hybrid FEM-LSSVR approach can achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to the base FEM solution. Comparable accuracy is a achieved when comparing the hybrid solution with a standalone FEM result with the same polynomial basis function order. The convergence studies were conducted for four elliptic boundary value problems to demonstrate the method's ability, accuracy, and reliability. Finally, the algorithm can be directly used as a plug-and-play method for super-resolving low-order numerical solvers and for super-resolution of expensive/under-resolved experimental data.",

Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state.

To address this difficulty, we revisit the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the projection problem and introduce relaxed conditions that remain sufficient for characterizing the solution. These conditions lead to a simple geometric interpretation: finding the solutions is equivalent to locating the intersection of two monotone piecewise linear functions. Building on this insight, we propose an iterative and highly efficient algorithm that searches directly for the intersection point and completely avoids all sorting procedures. We prove that the algorithm converges globally and reaches the exact solution in a finite number of iterations.

In the recent years, there has been substantial growth of research interest in modeling, well-posedness analysis, development of numerical methods and numerical algorithms of variational-hemivariational inequalities. This survey paper is devoted to a brief account of well-posedness and numerical analysis results for variational-hemivariational inequalities. The theoretical results are presented for a family of abstract stationary variational-hemivariational inequalities and the main idea is explained for an accessible proof of existence and uniqueness. To better appreciate the distinguished feature of variational-hemivariational inequalities, for comparison, three mechanical problems are introduced leading to a variational equation, a variational inequality, and a variational-hemivariational inequality, respectively. The paper also comments on mixed variational-hemivariational inequalities, with examples from applications in fluid mechanics, and on results concerning the numerical solution of other types (nonstationary, history dependent) of variational-hemivariational inequalities.",

    "abstract": "Wildfires pose significant threats to ecosystems and communities, yet accurately modeling fire spread remains challenging, particularly in regions where environmental and fuel data are scarce or unavailable. This study introduces an innovative conceptual and methodological framework for simulating wildfire propagation and estimating the rate of spread using a hybrid geometric and data-driven approach that relies exclusively on multi-source satellite observations. The framework integrates thermal fire-front detections, atmospheric conditions, and vegetation indices using two complementary geometric modeling strategies. The first strategy applies the Huygens principle, where generalized elliptical frames are expanded locally at every point along the fire perimeter, and their combined envelope forms the evolving wavefront. This method is best suited for situations in which environmental variables are available and can be incorporated to refine the anisotropic spread function. The second strategy relies solely on the generalized elliptical frames themselves; for each time step, an elliptical frame is constructed from the inferred head and back rates of spread and wind, and the burned area is obtained by enclosing the region determined by these curves. Together, these two methods provide a flexible toolkit that adapts to both data-rich and data-limited conditions while retaining a unified geometric interpretation of wildfire spread. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we present a case study based on the Eaton Fire, January 2025, using publicly available multi-day satellite imagery. Despite the absence of complete operational datasets for that event, the model driven only by satellite-derived parameters reproduces key qualitative features of the observed propagation pattern, underscoring the flexibility and robustness of the proposed approach in data-limited contexts.",

Our approach combines a tailored finite-dimensional reduction with a blow-up analysis based on Pohozaev identities and, in this way, extends the two-dimensional mass-critical result for $(n,p)=(2,3)$ obtained in Guo--Tian--Zhou (Calc.\\ Var.\\ Partial Differential Equations, 2022). The proof in that paper relies in an essential way on the two-dimensional structure and does not directly apply in higher dimensions, whereas here we develop a different approximation scheme and functional setting adapted to the high-dimensional sphere-at-infinity concentration regime.",

As a case study, we focus on a two-species exclusion process on a lattice (Two-TASEP), where two types of particles move in opposite directions with two arbitrary rates and exchange positions upon encounter with a third rate. Despite its simplicity, this toy model effectively captures the key features of multi-species driven diffusive systems, including phase separation phenomena.

We validate the accuracy, efficiency, and consistency of the solver on models with up to five subsystems, and compare its performance against two state-of-the-art agent-based methods: Tau-leaping and hybrid methods.

Unexpectedly, we show that maximal solutions have a transition zone that is open modulo a low-dimensional set: this allows us to apply obstacle problem theory for a finer regularity analysis. We further show that maximal solutions are in general non-universal, and we obtain sharp stability results under perturbation of each maximal solution. Lastly, we study maximal solutions in both the radial and the one-dimensional setting. We show that in these cases the maximal solution is universal and minimizes nucleation, in agreement with phenomena observed in the physics literature.",

We first introduce and rigorously analyze a time-varying fractional Brownian motion (TV-fBm) with a deterministic, H\u00f6lder-continuous Hurst exponent function. Key properties are established, including its exact variance scaling law, precise local increment asymptotics, local non-determinism, large deviation asymptotics for its increments, and a covariance structure that admits a closed-form hypergeometric representation. We then define a novel class of processes termed Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion (RfBm). Here,the Hurst exponent is governed by a Lipschitz-H\u00f6lder response function depending on the process state itself, creating an intrinsic feedback mechanism between state and memory. We establish the well-posedness of this definition, prove pathwise H\u00f6lder regularity of the induced instantaneous scaling exponent, and analyze associated cumulative memory processes along with their asymptotic convergence. The mathematical structure of RfBm naturally gives rise to a continuous-time, pathwise attention mechanism. We show that its kernel induces a well-defined attention weight distribution, derive fundamental bounds for these weights, and quantify the stability of attentional allocation through residence measures and volatility functionals. This work develops a stochastic-process-theoretic framework for concepts central to adaptive memory and content-sensitive information processing, offering a mathematically grounded perspective that may complement existing empirical approaches.",

    "abstract": "We study the free boundary in the supercooled Stefan problem, a classical model for the solidification of water below its freezing temperature. In contrast with the melting problem, physical experiments and heuristics indicate that the water--ice interface in the supercooled problem may exhibit fractal freezing sets, infinite-speed propagation of the frozen front, and nucleation (the spontaneous appearance of ice). Despite this, we show that the free boundary has a robust structure.\n  We decompose the free boundary into three parts: (1) a regular part that advances with finite speed in time; (2) a singular part consisting of points where the front attains infinite speed or nucleates, but with controlled space-time (i.e., $\\leq d-1$ parabolic) dimension; and (3) a jump component, which can have large dimension in a time slice, but which is contained in a space-time smooth graph and occurs only at a zero-dimensional set of times. Examples show that each of these parts can be nonempty.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the free boundary is the graph $t=s(x)$ of a continuously differentiable freezing time $s$, and the singular set coincides with the critical set of $s$, proving that singularities in supercooled freezing always occur with infinite speed.\n  These results provide the first free boundary regularity theory for the supercooled Stefan problem in arbitrary dimensions.",

Extensive numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings, including convergence tests and energy-decay comparisons. The proposed SFTR-\\(\u03b8\\) scheme demonstrates superior performance in maintaining monotonic energy decay compared to an alternative 2nd-order fractional backward difference formula, particularly in long-time simulations, highlighting its robustness and physical fidelity.",

The procedure is adaptive to the level of sparsity described by the sparsity index $\u03b2\\in(0,1)$. We also derive conditions that make almost full variable selection in the model of our interest impossible.

This yields a sharp upper bound on the spectral radius in terms of vertex weights, along with a lower bound on the multiplicity at which this bound is attained. Second, we establish a sharp lower bound for the spectral gap and characterize when the equality holds. Third, explicit lower bounds for the remaining eigenvalues are derived, linking the vertex-weighted Laplacian spectrum to that of a related weighted graph. Finally, we reveal new spectral relations between a simplicial complex and its subcomplexes. These results not only generalize numerous known theorems on combinatorial Laplacians but also provide deeper spectral insights into simplicial structures, ultimately unifying and extending a broad range of earlier work in this field.",

Building on our first part of the series on the classification of 33 dynamical equivalence classes (regardless of the uniqueness of positive fixed points), we demonstrate in this paper that classes 26 and 27 may indeed exhibit multiple positive fixed points. This reveals a fundamental distinction from both its 2-dimensional analogue and the classical 3-dimensional competitive Lotka-Volterra model. More concretely, by focusing on the model with identical growth and death rates, we establish an equivalent characterization for the (non)uniqueness of positive fixed points. Based on this characterization, we further show that classes 19-25 and 28-33 admit a unique positive fixed point and exhibit trivial dynamics: all trajectories converge to some fixed point (corresponding to harmonic solutions). In contrast, classes 26 and 27 possess richer dynamical scenarios: there can contain a continuum of invariant closed curves, on which orbits may be periodic (corresponding to subharmonic solutions), dense (corresponding to quasi-periodic solutions), or may even consist entirely of positive fixed points (which exhibits the nonuniqueness of positive fixed points).",

Each iteration costs $k+1$ residual evaluations, where $k \\ll n$ for $n$-dimensional problems, with $O(k^3)$ linear algebra overhead.\n  Benchmarks on calibration, regression, and deconvolution problems demonstrate consistent misfit reduction in both deterministic and stochastic settings.

The methodology connects three classical mathematical frameworks: De Moivre s theorem (1707), Chebyshev polynomials (1854), and results on the finiteness of integral points. Extended searches expanding the parameter space by a factor of 15 yield no new families, confirming saturation. The constant V0 connects to the Koide formula through Delta = 2/3 - V0 and approximates cos(13*pi/48) to 0.06 percent, suggesting links to cyclotomic fields. Using only dimensionless quantities, we obtain the electron anomaly ae with precision 0.15 ppb, the muon anomaly a_mu with 17 ppb, and the tau anomaly a_tau with 3.4 ppm.

    "abstract": "In this work, we present and analyze a fully-mixed finite element scheme for the dynamic poroelasticity problem in the low-frequency regime. We write the problem as a four-field, first-order, hyperbolic system of equations where the symmetry constraint on the stress field is imposed via penalization. This strategy is equivalent to adding a perturbation to the saddle point system arising when the stress symmetry is weakly-imposed. The coupling of solid and fluid phases is discretized by means of stable mixed elements in space and implicit time advancing schemes. The presented stability analysis is fully robust with respect to meaningful cases of degenerate model parameters. Numerical tests validate the convergence and robustness and assess the performances of the method for the simulation of wave propagation phenomena in porous materials.",

    "abstract": "The double-scaling limit of the SYK (DSSYK) model is known to possess an underlying $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ quantum group symmetry. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group-theoretical description of the degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the DSSYK model. In particular, we construct the operator-algebraic quantum Gauss decomposition for the von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\\rtimes \\mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e. the $q$-deformation of the normaliser of $\\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ in $\\mathrm{SL}(2,\\mathbb{C})$, and derive the Casimir action on its quantum homogeneous spaces. We then show that the dynamics on quantum AdS$_{2,q}$ space reduces to that of the DSSYK model. Furthermore, we argue that the extension of the global symmetry group to its normaliser is not only necessary for a consistent definition of the locally compact quantum group, but that, moreover, the reduction to the DSSYK model works exclusively at the level of the normaliser. The von Neumann algebraic description is shown to give a natural restriction on the allowed quantised coordinates, elegantly ensuring length positivity and non-negative integer chord numbers. Lastly, we make remarks on the correlation function related to the strange series representation, which is argued to interpolate between the AdS and dS regions of our $q$-homogeneous space.",

    "abstract": "This is a contribution to the problem of classifying all deformations - a. k. a. liftings - of the bosonization of a Nichols algebra $\\mathfrak{B}(V)$ over a cosemisimple and non-semisimple Hopf algebra $H$. Such a situation arises when the underlying field has positive characteristic or when $H$ is infinite-dimensional. Given an $H$-module $M$ that is an extension of $V$ by $H$, we first introduce an algebra $T(V)\\#_MH$ which generalizes the usual bosonization $T(V)\\#H$. Indeed, these two objects coincide when $M$ is a trivial extension. We provide necessary conditions for $T(V)\\#_MH$ to be a Hopf algebra and a cocycle deformation of $T(V)\\#H$. These conditions appear particularly natural when $H$ is a group algebra. We then prove that every lifting is a quotient of $T(V)\\#_MH$ for some extension $M$. Echoing Archimedes, $T(V)\\#_MH$ stands as a fulcrum over which we can pivot to lift the relations of the Nichols algebra. From this point, one can replicate the strategy proposed by Andruskiewitsch, Angiono, Garcia I., Masuoka and the second author to show that every lifting is a cocycle deformation of $\\mathfrak{B}(V)\\#H$. We illustrate this idea with two examples of different nature. We classify all pointed liftings of the Fomin-Kirillov algebra $\\mathcal{FK}_3$ in characteristic $2$, and prove they are all cocycle deformations one another. We also prove that the Jordanian enveloping algebra of $\\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ defined by Andruskiewitsch, Angiono and Heckenberger is a cocycle deformation of the bosonization of the Jordan plane over the infinite cyclic group.",

We further provide new necessary and sufficient conditions for strong Arens irregularity of $L^{1}(H)$ in terms of the spectral behaviour of $\u03bd_{\\infty}$, explore weighted (Beurling-type) hypergroup algebras, and obtain the first detailed comparison between the left and right topological centres for a wide class of non-classical examples.

Across courses, I saw less passive lecturing, more visible participation, and students explaining their reasoning during the closing time.

For integers m and r, define a delta function on {0,1}^r to be a function f: Z_m^r -> C with f(0) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for all nonzero Boolean x. The basic question we study is how small the Fourier sparsity of a delta function can be; namely how sparse such an f can be in the Fourier basis?\n  In addition to being intrinsically interesting and natural, such questions arise naturally when studying \"S-decoding polynomials\" for the known matching vector families. Finding S-decoding polynomials of reduced sparsity, which corresponds to finding delta functions with low Fourier sparsity, would improve the current best PIR schemes.\n  We show nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the Fourier sparsity of delta functions. Our proofs are elementary and clean. These results imply limitations on improving Matching Vector PIR schemes simply by finding better S-decoding polynomials. In particular, there are no S-decoding polynomials that can make Matching Vector PIRs based on the known matching vector families achieve polylogarithmic communication with a constant number of servers. Many interesting questions remain open.",

    "abstract": "In incompressible and inviscid fluids, the vortex atmosphere refers to the collection of fluid particles outside the support of a traveling vortex that are nevertheless carried along with it. This phenomenon has been recognized since the nineteenth century, e.g., in the classical works of O. Reynolds [Nature, 1876] and O. Lodge [Lond. Edinb. Dubl. Phil. Mag., 1885], yet rigorous mathematical definitions and proofs have remained largely undeveloped, with most subsequent studies relying on thin-core approximations or asymptotic analyses. In this paper, we give a rigorous definition of a vortex atmosphere and establish its existence and uniqueness. We further compare the planar atmosphere surrounding a 2D vortex dipole with the axisymmetric atmosphere surrounding a 3D vortex ring. In particular, we emphasize and prove the topological distinctions observed by W. Hicks [Lond. Edinb. Dubl. Phil. Mag., 1919]: under natural assumptions, every 2D dipole with its atmosphere forms an oval-shaped region, whereas for 3D rings, both spheroidal and toroidal configurations may occur. Our proof is based on showing that each atmosphere can be characterized precisely as a specific superlevel set of its corresponding stream function.",

This problem is mainly motivated by applications to non-equilibrium energy sinks. While the effect of adding noise to the fast variable, which is important for noise-induced tipping, has been previously analysed in detail, the case where the slow variable is perturbed by noise has not been considered before. Our main result is that the noise increases the slow variable on average. We compute the effect of the noise, to lowest order, on the expectation and variance of the slow variable after the bifurcation. The contribution of the noise can be explicitly expressed in terms of Airy functions. We also provide numerical simulations, which show that the expansion to lowest order matches the observations for fairly large values of the noise intensity.",

By assuming a local Lipschitz condition, we derive nonasymptotic and asymptotic convergence rates measured by the gradient of the Moreau envelope.

In this approach, the two-point boundary value problem, including the control variables, becomes tractable. It yields notions of optimal time horizon, optimal parameter design and optimal rest-to-rest trajectories.

The resulting convection-diffusion-reaction system consists of four partial differential equations (PDEs) and one ordinary differential equation (ODE). We develop a finite volume (FV) scheme for this system, together with non-negativity and a priori bounds for the discrete solution, so that we establish the existence of a discrete solution to the FV scheme. It is shown that the scheme converges to an admissible weak solution of the model. The reaction terms of the system are discretized using a semi-implicit strategy that coincides with a nonstandard discretization of the spatially homogeneous (SH) model. This construction enables us to prove that the FV scheme is dynamically consistent with respect to the spatially homogeneous version of the model. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the model and to assess the behavior of the FV scheme.",

Chudnovsky and for E-functions (and, more generally, for holonomic arithmetic Gevrey series) by Y. Andr{\u00e9}. Our approach is based on a preliminary study of independent interest of the nature of the solutions of Mahler equations. Roughly speaking, we prove a reduction result for Mahler systems, implying that any Mahler equation admits a complete basis of solutions formed of what we call generalized Mahler series. These are sums involving Puiseux series, Hahn series of a very special type and solutions of inhomogeneous equations of order 1 with constant coefficients. In the light of B. Adamczewski, J. P. Bell and D. Smertnig's recent height gap theorem, we introduce a natural filtration on the set of generalized Mahler series according to the arithmetic growth of the coefficients of the Puiseux series involved in their decomposition. This filtration has five pieces. Our purity theorem states that the membership of a generalized Mahler series to one of the three largest pieces of this filtration propagates to any other generalized Mahler series solution of its minimal Mahler equation. We also show that this statement does not extend to the smallest two pieces.",

    "abstract": "Property $(P)$, introduced in recent work and rooted in the classical theory of Parter vertices, concerns the existence of a nonsingular matrix $A\\in S(G)$ for which every vertex of $G$ is a $P$-vertex. Previous investigations have fully characterized the property for trees, established it for cycles, extended it to unicyclic graphs, and shown that bipartite graphs with a perfect matching always satisfy property $(P)$. However, whether the converse holds for connected bipartite graphs remains open in general.\n  In this paper, we make progress toward answering this question on multiple fronts. We first prove that every connected bipartite graph satisfying property $(P)$ must be balanced, providing a fundamental necessary condition. We further establish complete characterizations for several significant families of bipartite graphs. Specially, we show that every connected bipartite graph of order at most $8$ has property $(P)$ if and only if it has a perfect matching, and more generally, that a connected bipartite graph of order $8+2k$ with at least $k$ pendant edges satisfies property $(P)$ exactly when it has a perfect matching. We further prove that within the class of triangular bipartite graphs, property $(P)$ is equivalent to the existence of a perfect matching, providing a full characterization for this broad structural subclass.\n  In addition, we introduce the threaded union over a graph, a general operation for assembling larger graphs from smaller components, and show that threaded union over a tree--cycle block graph preserves property $(P)$. This significantly generalizes earlier result about joining two graphs with property $(P)$ by a single edge preserves property $(P)$.",

Another motivation for studying this problem is to understand the relation between rational connectedness of $X$ and (uniform) RC-positivity of the holomorphic tangent bundle $TX$.\n  In this paper, we obtain results in this direction. In particular, we show that if a vector bundle $E$ is uniformly weakly RC-positive, then $S^kE\\otimes \\det E$ is uniformly RC-positive for any $k\\geq 0$, and $S^kE$ is uniformly RC-positive for $k$ large.

To address the distributional ambiguity, we explore the design of causal affine control policies to minimize the worst-case expected regret over all distributions in the given ambiguity set. The resulting minimax optimal control problem is shown to admit an equivalent reformulation as a tractable convex program that corresponds to a regularized version of the nominal linear-quadratic stochastic control problem. While this convex program can be recast as a semidefinite program, semidefinite programs are typically solved using primal-dual interior point methods that scale poorly with the problem size in practice. To address this limitation, we propose a scalable dual projected subgradient method to compute optimal controllers to an arbitrary accuracy.

All worst-case misalignment occurs already in dimension two, leading to an explicit collapse principle and a sharp nonlinear bound for finite products. The proof avoids Hilbert-metric and cone-theoretic techniques, relying instead on basic calculus. In the Hilbert metric, the classical Birkhoff-Bushell contraction captures only the linearized asymptotic regime, whereas our nonlinear envelope function gives the exact worst-case behavior for finite products.",

The behavior of the Noetherian type under the $G_\u03b4$-modification was investigated by Milovich and Spadaro. A central question, posed by them, is whether the Noetherian type of the $G_\u03b4$-modification of the space $D(2)^{\\aleph_\u03c9}$ is $\u03c9_1$. This statement, denoted (Nt), is known to be independent of ZFC + GCH: it holds under ``GCH + $\\square_{\\aleph_\u03c9}$'', but fails under ``GCH + $(\\aleph_{\u03c9+1}, \\aleph_\u03c9)\\to (\\aleph_1, \\aleph_0)$''.\n  We place this phenomenon in a broader context by identifying similar independence phenomena for several topological and combinatorial principles.

Assuming GCH, we analyze the logical relationships between these principles and show, for example, that SPL implies wFN, which in turn implies both SAT, HnT and Nt, while SAT does not imply Nt.",

    "title": "Vertex-distinguishing edge coloring of graphs",
    "abstract": "Let $k \\ge 1$ be an integer and let $G$ be a nonempty simple graph. An \\emph{edge-$k$-coloring} $\\varphi$ of $G$ is an assignment of colors from $\\{1,\\ldots,k\\}$ to the edges of $G$ such that no two adjacent edges receive the same color. For a vertex $v \\in V(G)$, we write $\\varphi(v)$ for the set of colors assigned to the edges incident with $v$. The coloring $\\varphi$ is called \\emph{vertex-distinguishing} if $\\varphi(u) \\ne \\varphi(v)$ for every pair of distinct vertices $u,v \\in V(G)$. A vertex-distinguishing edge-$k$-coloring exists if and only if $G$ has at most one isolated vertex and no isolated edge. The least integer $k$ for which such a coloring exists is called the \\emph{vertex-distinguishing chromatic index} of $G$, denoted $\u03c7'_{vd}(G)$. In 1997, Burris and Schelp conjectured that for every graph $G$ with at most one isolated vertex and no isolated edge, $ k(G) \\;\\le\\; \u03c7'_{vd}(G) \\;\\le\\; k(G)+1$, where $k(G)$ is the natural lower bound required for a vertex-distinguishing coloring in $G$. In 2004, Balister, Kostochka, Li, and Schelp verified the conjecture for graphs $G$ satisfying $\u0394(G) \\ge \\sqrt{2|V(G)|} + 4 $ and $\u03b4(G) \\ge 5$. For graphs that do not satisfy these conditions, the best known general upper bound on $\u03c7'_{vd}(G)$ remains $|V(G)| + 1$, established in 1999 by Bazgan, Harkat-Benhamdine, Li, and Wo\u017aniak. In this paper, we prove that $\u03c7'_{vd}(G) \\le \\floor{5.5k(G)+6.5}$, which represents a substantial improvement over the bound $|V(G)| + 1$ whenever $k(G) = o(|V(G)|)$. We further show that $\u03c7'_{vd}(G) \\le k(G) + 3$, for all $d$-regular graphs $G$ with $d \\ge \\log_2 |V(G)|\\geq 8$.",

The convergence of the latter to the $\u03a6^4\\_2$ free energy then follows from arguments of Fr{\u00f6}hlich-Knowles-Schlein-Sohinger. This derivation parallels recent results of Nam-Zhu-Zhu.",

Crucially, this tree bijection requires the hyperbolic surface to have at least one cusp as origin, from which point distances are measured. In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover.",

This paper proposes spectral decompositions of the controllability Gramian and its inverse based on system eigenvalues for a continuous LTI dynamical system in the controllability canonical (companion) form. The Gramian and its inverse are represented as sums of Hermitian matrices, each corresponding to individual system eigenvalues or their pairwise combinations. These decompositions are obtained for the solutions of both algebraic and differential Lyapunov and Riccati equations with arbitrary initial conditions, allowing for the estimation of system spectral properties over an arbitrary time interval and their prediction at future moments. The derived decompositions are also generalized to the case of multiple eigenvalues in the dynamics matrix spectrum, enabling a closed-form estimation of the effects of resonant interactions with the system's eigenmodes. The spectral components are interpreted as measurable quantities in the minimum energy control problem. Therefore, they are unambiguously defined and can quantitatively characterize the influence of individual eigenmodes and associated system devices on controllability, observability, and the asymptotic dynamics of perturbation energy. The additional information obtained from these decompositions can improve the accuracy of algorithms in solving various practical problems, such as stability analysis, minimum energy control, structural design, tuning regulators, optimal placement of actuators and sensors, network analysis, and model order reduction.",

In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based reduced-order modeling strategy, leveraging Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on synthetic microvascular graphs to approximate hemodynamic quantities on anatomically realistic domains. Our method combines algorithms for synthetic vascular generation with a physics-informed training procedure that integrates graph topological information and local flow dynamics. To ensure the physical reliability of the learned surrogates, we incorporate a physics-informed loss functional derived from the governing equations, allowing enforcement of mass conservation and rheological constraints. The resulting GNN architecture demonstrates robust generalization capabilities across diverse network configurations. The GNN formulation is validated on benchmark problems with linear and nonlinear rheology, showing accurate pressure and velocity field reconstruction with substantial computational gains over full-order solvers. The methodology showcases significant generalization capabilities with respect to vascular complexity, as highlighted by tests on data from the mouse cerebral cortex. This work establishes a new class of graph-based surrogate models for microvascular flow, grounded in physical laws and equipped with inductive biases that mirror mass conservation and rheological models, opening new directions for real-time inference in vascular modeling and biomedical applications.",

A classical example known since the 1930's is that a time series is fully determined by its values on the negative integers if its spectrum has a gap, or at least a sufficiently deep zero. We extend such results to higher dimensions and continuous settings by establishing a connection with the concept of uniqueness pairs, rooted in the uncertainty principle of harmonic analysis. We present several other manifestations of this principle, unify and strengthen seemingly unrelated results across different models: quasicrystals and stealthy processes are shown to be maximally rigid on cones, and discrete integer-valued processes are necessarily periodic when they have a simply connected spectrum. Finally, we identify a surprising class of continuous fields with seemingly standard behavior, such as linear variance and finite dependency range, that undergo a phase transition: they are perfectly interpolable on B(0, $\u03c1$) for $\u03c1$ ___ 2 $\u03c0$ but exhibit no rigidity for $\u03c1$ > 2.",

It is known that $S$ is neutral when $t \\geq k+1 \\geq 2$ and $n \\geq 8k + 2t - 4$. In this paper, we identify values of $k \\geq t$ such that, for all $n$ in a specific subinterval of $[8k + 2t - 4, \\infty)$, $S$ remains neutral. Since the anti-Ramsey numbers for matchings are well understood, our results provide a complete determination of the anti-Ramsey number for $G$ under these conditions. Based on our findings, we conjecture that this neutrality may extend to the general case $t \\geq 1$, $k \\geq 1$, and $n \\geq 4k + 2t$, but not when $t = 0$, $k \\geq 2$, and $n \\geq 4k$.",

    "abstract": "Following a research line proposed by Hrushovski in his work on pseudofinite fields with an additive character, we investigate the theory $\\mathrm{ACFA}^{+}$ which is the model companion of the theory of difference fields with an additive character on the fixed field added as a continuous logic predicate. $\\mathrm{ACFA}^{+}$ is the common theory (in characteristic $0$) of the algebraic closure of finite fields with the Frobenius automorphism and the standard character on the fixed field and turns out to be a simple theory. We fully characterise 3-amalgamation and deduce that the connected component of the Kim-Pillay group (for any completion of $\\mathrm{ACFA}^{+}$) is abelian as conjectured by Hrushovski. Finally, we describe a natural expansion of $\\mathrm{ACFA}^{+}$ in which geometric elimination of continuous logic imaginaries holds.",

    "title": "Complete Structural Analysis of $q$-Heisenberg Algebras: Homology, Rigidity, Automorphisms, and Deformations",
    "abstract": "This paper establishes several fundamental structural properties of the $q$-Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$, a quantum deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra. We first prove that when $q$ is not a root of unity, the global homological dimension of $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is exactly $3n$, while it becomes infinite when $q$ is a root of unity. We then demonstrate the rigidity of its iterated Ore extension structure, showing that any such presentation is essentially unique up to permutation and scaling of variables. The graded automorphism group is completely determined to be isomorphic to $(\\mathbb{C}^*)^{2n} \\rtimes S_n$. Furthermore, $\\mathfrak{h}_n(q)$ is shown to possess a universal deformation property as the canonical PBW-preserving deformation of the classical Heisenberg algebra $\\mathfrak{h}_n(1)$. We compute its Hilbert series as $(1-t)^{-3n}$, confirming polynomial growth of degree $3n$, and establish that its Gelfand--Kirillov dimension coincides with its classical Krull dimension. These results are extended to a generalized multi-parameter version $\\mathfrak{H}_n(\\mathbf{Q})$, and illustrated through detailed examples and applications in representation theory and deformation quantization.",

    "title": "Strong Global Convergence of the Consensus-Based Optimization Algorithm",
    "abstract": "Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is a multi-agent metaheuristic derivative-free optimization algorithm that has proven to be capable of globally minimizing nonconvex nonsmooth functions across a diverse range of applications while being amenable to theoretical analysis. The method leverages an interplay between exploration of the energy landscape of the objective function through a system of interacting particles subject to stochasticity and exploitation of the particles' positions through the computation of a global consensus about the location of the minimizer based on the Laplace principle. In this paper, we prove strong mean square convergence of the practical numerical time-discrete CBO algorithm to the global minimizer for a rich class of objective functions. For CBO with both isotropic and anisotropic diffusion, our convergence result features conditions on the choice of the hyperparameters as well as explicit rates of convergence in the time discretization step size $\u0394t$ and the number of particles $N$. By interpreting the time-discrete algorithm at the continuous-time level through a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), our proof strategy combines traditional finite-time convergence theory for numerical methods applied to SDEs with careful considerations due to the fact that the CBO coefficients do not satisfy a global Lipschitz condition. To accomodate the latter, we adopt a recently proposed generalization of Sznitman's classical argument, which allows to discard an event of small probability, controllable through fine moment estimates for the particle systems.",
