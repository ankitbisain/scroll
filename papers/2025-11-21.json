    "abstract": "In recent studies \\cite{ZZ24, FY24}, the Interior Penalty Virtual Element Method (IPVEM) has been developed for solving a fourth-order singular perturbation problem, with uniform convergence established in the lowest-order case concerning the perturbation parameter. However, the resulting uniform convergence rate is only of half-order, which is suboptimal. In this work, we demonstrate that the proposed IPVEM in fact achieves optimal and uniform error estimates, even in the presence of boundary layers. The theoretical results are substantiated through extensive numerical experiments, which confirm the validity of the error estimates and highlight the method's effectiveness for singularly perturbed problems.",

These foliations generalize the classical nilpotent foliations in dimension two. We show that every nilpotent foliation in higher dimensions can be described as the pullback of Takens' normal form, which naturally leads to the existence of cuspidal hypersurfaces as invariant sets.\n  We focus on the case where the separatrix is a quasi-ordinary cuspidal hypersurface, and we provide a characterization of those foliations that are of generalized hypersurface type. Furthermore, we recall the Newton polyhedron of a foliation and prove that, for foliations with a quasi-ordinary cuspidal separatrix, being of generalized hypersurface type is equivalent to the coincidence of the Newton polyhedra of the foliation and its separatrix. This provides a new criterion that extends previous results studied by Fern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez and J. Mozo (2006), and later partially generalized by the second-named author.",

Together with the recent work by the first three authors and D. Pilod (2024) on the deep-water convergence in $L^2$, this work completes the well-posedness and convergence study of ILW on both geometries within the $L^2$-framework. Our proof equally applies to both geometries and is based on the following two ingredients: the complete integrability of ILW and the normal form method. More precisely, by making use of the Lax pair structure and the perturbation determinant for ILW, recently introduced by Harrop-Griffths, Killip, and Vi\u015fan (2025), we first establish weakly uniform (in small depth parameters) equicontinuity in $L^2$ of solutions to the scaled ILW, providing a control on the high frequency part of solutions. Then, we treat the low frequency part by implementing a perturbative argument based on an infinite iteration of normal form reductions for KdV.",

Computing this model is a central problem in arithmetic geometry. For non-hyperelliptic genus $3$ curves, which are canonically embedded as plane quartics, methods like admissible reduction become challenging in small residue characteristics. This thesis establishes a precise connection between the abstractly defined stable model and computationally accessible GIT-stable plane models. We prove that a GIT-stable plane model of a smooth plane quartic exists if and only if its stable reduction is non-hyperelliptic. When this condition holds, we show that the stable model is the unique minimal semistable model that dominates the GIT-stable model. The corresponding domination morphism is geometrically explicit: it contracts the $1$-tails of the stable reduction to cusps on the special fiber of the GIT-stable model and is an immersion elsewhere. This result provides a geometric framework for computing the stable model by first finding a GIT-stable model and then resolving its cuspidal singularities.",

    "abstract": "We propose a flexible scenario-based regularized Sample Average Approximation (SBR-SAA) framework for stochastic optimization. This work is motivated by challenges in standard Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (WDRO), where out-of-sample performance, particularly tail risk, is sensitive to the choice of the p-norm, and formulations can be computationally intractable. Our method is inspired by the asymptotic expansion of the WDRO objective and introduces a regularizer that penalizes the (sub)gradient norm of the objective at a selected set of scenarios. This framework serves a dual purpose: (i) it provides a computationally tractable alternative to WDRO by using a representative subset of the data, and (ii) it can provide targeted robustness by incorporating user-defined adverse scenarios. We establish the theoretical properties of this framework by proving its equivalence to a decision-dependent WDRO problem, from which we derive finite sample guarantees and asymptotic consistency. We demonstrate the method's efficacy in two applications: (1) a multi-product newsvendor problem, where SBR-SAA serves as a tractable alternative to NP-hard WDRO, and (2) a mean-risk portfolio optimization problem, where it successfully uses historical crisis data to improve out-of-sample performance.",

Typically the states are chosen to be blue and white, and a forcing set is an initial set of blue vertices such that all of the vertices are blue at the end of the process. In this context, the propagation time of a set in a graph is the number of iterations of the color change rule required to have all vertices blue, performing independent color changes simultaneously. Different minimal forcing sets need not have the same propagation time, and we study the realizability of specific integers as propagation times of minimal forcing sets in graphs for two of the most well-studied color change rules (standard and positive semidefinite). Particular attention is paid to the case where all minimal forcing sets have the same propagation time, and we term this phenomenon fixed propagation time. For each of the two variants, we present a general form of graphs all of which have fixed propagation time equal to one. We conjecture that these are the only such graphs and prove the conjectures for joins of graphs. Families of graphs with longer fixed propagation time for standard forcing are exhibited, and it is shown that such graphs do not exist for positive semidefinite forcing.",

However, these measures fail to capture the typical growth rate of matrix products, focusing instead on the worst and best-case scenarios. Nevertheless, when examining, for instance, a switching dynamical system, a probabilistic rate of growth, which characterizes typical trajectories, emerges as a highly intriguing and significant measure.\n  In this article, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous analysis of the random spectral radius. This joint spectral characteristic is computed on the set of length-$n$ products from a semigroup by random sampling according to a given probability measure. We establish asymptotic results-including a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem-for cases where the matrices are either diagonal (equivalently, commuting), upper- or lower-triangular, or small perturbations of diagonal matrices.\n  Subsequently, we provide numerical evidence that the random spectral radius of arbitrary (that is structurally unconstrained) families of matrices exhibits asymptotic behavior similar to that of diagonal or nearly diagonal matrix families.",

A significant challenge arises from the distribution-dependence of the coefficients, thereby causing the lack of the stochastic flow property on $H$. To address this issue, we first transform the original equation into a system on the product space $H \\times \\mathcal{P}(H)$ and consider the existence of random attractors on this space. We then analyze cocycles associated with two parametric dynamical systems. Within this framework, we define the corresponding pullback random attractor and develop a general theory for the existence of random attractors for such cocycles. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to McKean-Vlasov stochastic ordinary differential equations, McKean-Vlasov stochastic reaction-diffusion equations, and McKean-Vlasov stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes equations. In the case where the attractor reduces to a singleton set $\\mathcal{A}(\u03c9):=(\u03be(\u03c9),\u03bc_\\infty)$, we show that $\u03be$ corresponds to the stationary solution for the decoupled SPDE,satisfying $\\mathbb{P}\\circ[\u03be]^{-1}=\u03bc_\\infty$.",

    "title": "New Empirical Process Tools and Their Applications to Robust Deep ReLU Networks and Phase Transitions for Nonparametric Regression",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces new empirical process tools for analyzing a broad class of statistical learning models under heavy-tailed noise and complex function classes. Our primary contribution is the derivation of two Dudley-type maximal inequalities for expected empirical processes that remove restrictive assumptions such as light tails and uniform boundedness of the function class. These inequalities enlarge the scope of empirical process theory available for statistical learning and nonparametric estimation. Exploiting the new bounds, we establish robustness guarantees for deep ReLU network estimators in Huber and quantile regression. In particular, we prove a unified non-asymptotic sub-Gaussian concentration bound that remains valid even under infinite-variance noise and provide a comprehensive analysis of non-asymptotic robustness for deep Huber estimators across all noise regimes. For deep quantile regression, we provide the first non-asymptotic sub-Gaussian bounds without requiring moment assumptions. As an additional application, our framework yields estimation error bounds for nonparametric least-squares estimators that simultaneously accommodate infinite-variance noise, non-Donsker function classes, and approximation error. Moreover, unlike prior approaches based on specialized multiplier processes, our framework extends to broader empirical risk minimization problems, including the nonparametric generalized linear models and the ``set-structured'' models.",

This identity is derived from a core algebraic relation on the binomial coefficients that form the kernel of the nested sum's representation.

This classical result has not only found applications in matroid theory, but also in the analysis and design of various algorithms. In our work, we prove a common generalization of this and other known basis exchange properties by showing that for any subsets $X \\subseteq A \\setminus B$ and $Y \\subseteq B \\setminus A$, there exist subsets $U \\subseteq A \\setminus B$ and $V \\subseteq B \\setminus A$ such that $X\\subseteq U$, $Y\\subseteq V$, $A-U+V$ and $B+U-V$ are bases, and $|U|=|V|$ is at most the rank of $X+Y$. As an application, we prove the robustness of the local search algorithm for finding maximum weight matroid bases. For matroids representable over a field of characteristic zero, we further generalize our exchange property to include the very recent Equitability Theorem (SODA 2026), by establishing a far-reaching generalization of the Grassmann-Pl\u00fccker identity.",

However, situations often arise when the Dirichlet series behaves like a product of complex powers of several Dirichlet $L$-functions to a modulus $q$. In such situations, one often requires sharp asymptotic formulas for the partial sums $\\sum_{n \\le x} \\, a_n$ that apply in much wider ranges of $q$ than permitted by known forms of the Landau-Selberg-Delange method. In this manuscript, we address this problem, giving new estimates on $\\sum_{n \\le x} \\, a_n$ in ranges of $q$ that are (in most applications) much wider than attainable from previous results. Our results also weaken certain hypotheses on the size of $\\{a_n\\}_n$. As applications of our main theorems, we extend Landau's classical results on the distribution of integers with prime factors restricted to progressions, and improve upon Chang, Martin and Nguyen's work on the distributions of the least invariant factors and least primary factors of multiplicative groups. We also extend the classical Sathe-Selberg theorem and study the local laws of the functions $\u03a9_a(n)$ and $\u03c9_a(n)$, that count (with and without multiplicity, respectively), the number of prime divisors of $n$ lying in the progression $a$ mod $q$.",

Given a point and a two-plane in the tangent space, we compare the heat mass transported along that plane with its Euclidean counterpart using the relative entropy of finite measures. We show that the leading small-time distortion of this directional entropy encodes precisely the local curvature of the manifold. In particular, the planar information imbalance determines both the scalar curvature and the sectional curvature at a point, and assembling these directional values produces a bilinear tensor that coincides exactly with the classical Riemannian curvature operator.\n  The method is entirely analytic and avoids Jacobi fields, curvature identities, or variational formulas. Curvature appears solely through the behaviour of heat flow under the exponential map, providing a new viewpoint in which curvature is realized as an infinitesimal information defect of diffusion. This perspective suggests further connections between geometric analysis and information theory and offers a principled analytic mechanism for detecting and reconstructing curvature using only heat diffusion data.",

These domains arise as nontrivial perturbations of some classical symmetric solutions to the same problem. Our approach relies on an implicit construction based on the Crandall-Rabinowitz bifurcation theorem, which allows us to detect branches of non-radial solutions bifurcating from a family of radial ones. The resulting examples highlight new geometric configurations of the torsion problem in the three-dimensional sphere, providing another proof of the fact that the rigidity of Serrin-type results can fail in the presence of curvature.",

The paper has two main parts. First, we develop the theory of the metric Rips filtration and its colimit in natural coarse categories: informally, we characterise when the Rips colimit produces a canonical large-scale model of a metric space and use this to prove that the quasigeodesic subcategory is closed under colimits in the coarsely Lipschitz category. We also establish adjointness properties of the Rips colimit and use them to characterise extremal metrics and universal morphisms from quasigeodesic sources.\n  Second, we apply this machinery to characterise universal quasigeodesic cones via an explicit Rips-Tuple recipe. In the HHS setting this yields a concrete, canonical model of the total space: an HHS is quasi-isometric to a Rips graph of the space of coarsely consistent tuples in the product of its factor spaces. Moreover, we give a local-to-global criterion that promotes uniformly controlled, factorwise retractions to a canonical global hierarchical retraction. Because the approach is based on universal properties and uniformly controlled coarse data rather than inductive constructions, distance formulae, or hierarchy paths, it applies equally well to arbitrary families of metric spaces equipped with pairwise constraints.",

In the case of spreading, we determine the asymptotic spreading speed of the fronts by using a semi-wave system and provide sharp estimates for the moving fronts.

A truncation error analysis is provided, it shows that the scheme should be third order accurate for smooth solutions. This is confirmed by numerical experiments. Several numerical examples are presented to show that the scheme is indeed bound preserving and non oscillatory on a wide range on numerical benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of data centers increasingly requires data center operators to \"bring own generation\" to complement the available utility power plants to supply all or part of data center load. This practice sharply increases the number of generators on the bulk power system and shifts operational focus toward fuel costs rather than traditional startup and runtime constraints. Conventional mixed-integer unit commitment formulations are not well suited for systems with thousands of flexible, fast-cycling units. We propose a unit commitment formulation that relaxes binary commitment decisions by allowing generators to be fractionally on, enabling the use of algorithms for continuous solvers. We then use a rounding approach to get a feasible unit commitment. For a 276-unit system, solution time decreases from 10 hours to less than a second, with minor accuracy degradation. Our approach scales with no issues to tens of thousands of generators, which allows solving problems on the scale of the major North America interconnections. The bulk of computation is parallel and GPU compatible, enabling further acceleration in future work.",

This yields a new algebraic notion of Gibbs polystability, conjecturally equivalent to K-polystability. The definition involves a limit of log canonical thresholds on the GIT semistable locus of the N-fold products of the Fano manifold that we conjecture coincides with an analytic reduced stability threshold encoding the coercivity of the K-energy functional modulo automorphisms. These conjectures follow from an overarching conjectural Large Deviation Principle for the limit when N tends to infinity. We prove several of our conjectures for log Fano curves and derive a strengthened logarithmic Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on the two-sphere, which implies Aubin's refinement of the Moser-Trudinger inequality.

In this study, we propose intra-block FCTN (iFCTN) decomposition, a novel (un)folding-free variant of FCTN decomposition that streamlines computation. We parameterize each FCTN factor through Khatri-Rao products, which significantly reduces the complexity of reconstructing intermediate sub-networks and yields subproblems with well-structured coefficient matrices. Furthermore, we deploy the proposed iFCTN decomposition on the representative task of tensor completion and design an efficient proximal alternating minimization algorithm while retaining convergence guarantees.

Conversely, we show that any LCS mapping tori over a closed contact manifold satisfies this condition, thereby providing a characterization of LCS mapping tori over closed contact manifolds. In doing so, we establish a link between the limit values of the elasticity of an LCS mapping torus over a closed contact manifold and the Birkhoff average of the conformal factor of its contactomorphism.

    "title": "On a Class of Dynamical Poisson-Voronoi Tessellations",
    "abstract": "Consider a dynamical network model featuring mobile stations on the Euclidean plane. The initial locations of the stations are given by a homogeneous Poisson point process. The stations are all moving at a constant speed and in a random direction. Consider fixed users located in the Euclidean plane, which are served by the mobile stations. Each user stays connected to the nearest station at any given point of time. Since the stations are moving, an user disconnects and connects with different stations over time, by always selecting which ever station is the closest. This gives rise to a dynamical version of the Poisson-Voronoi tessellation. The focus of this paper is on the sequence of ``handover'' events of a typical user, which are the epochs when its association changes. This defines a point process on the time-axis, the ``handover point process''. We show that this point process is stationary and we determine its main properties, in particular its intensity and the joint distribution of its inter-event times. We also analyze the handover Palm distributions of several variables of practical interest. This includes the distance to the closest mobile stations and the point process of all other mobile stations at handover epochs. The analysis is conducted both in the single-speed and in the multi-speed scenarios. It leads to the identification of the three dimensional state variables that ``Markovize'' the association dynamics. The analysis is based on a specific system of non-compact particles. The motivations are in the modeling of low or medium orbit satellite wireless communication networks. The model studied here is a planar ``caricature'' of this problem, which is initially defined on the sphere.",

We first classify one-dimensional representations of $A_q$, on which spin-j K-operators constructed in [LBG] act as K-matrices. Using the K-operators and these K-matrices, we construct universal spin-j transfer matrices generating commutative subalgebras in $A_q$. Within a technical conjecture, we derive their fusion hierarchy, the so-called universal TT-relations. On spin-chain representations of $A_q$, we show how the universal transfer matrices evaluate to spin-chain transfer matrices, and as a result we get explicit TT-relations for all values of spins for auxiliary and quantum spaces, any inhomogeneities, and general integrable boundary conditions. In particular, we derive previously conjectured TT-relations. Using the TT-relations, we show that n-th local conserved quantities of the spin-j chains of length N are polynomials of total degree 4Njn in two non-local operators of the q-Onsager algebra. As a result, we give an algorithm of explicit calculation of all conserved quantities (Hamiltonians and higher logarithmic derivatives of the transfer matrix) in terms of spin operators. Furthermore, using the universal TT-relations we derive exchange relations between spin-j Hamiltonians and the two non-local operators, which shows existence of non-trivial symmetries for special boundary conditions, in the sense that they commute with all Hamiltonian densities. As a yet another application of our universal TT-relations we propose universal T-system, Y-system and universal TQ-relations for $A_q$, and as a result, universal TQ for the q-Onsager algebra. In view of application to diagonal boundary conditions, we also obtain universal TT- and TQ-relations for a certain degenerate version of $A_q$ known as centrally extended augmented q-Onsager algebra.",

In this paper, we investigate the isomorphism problem for ultraproducts of operator algebras from a model-theoretic perspective.

    "abstract": "Given two distinct reduced, irreducible curves of given degrees, contained in projective space but whose union is not contained in a hyperplane, what is the largest number of points of intersection they can have? When the projective space is the plane, this is trivial. For projective 3 space this problem was solved independently by Diaz and by Giuffrida in 1986. They showed that two curves achieving the maximum number of intersection points have to be rational curves on a smooth surface of minimal degree, i.e., a quadric surface. Note that these curves are far from being arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay. In contrast, Hartshorne and Mir\u00f3-Roig addressed this problem in 2015 for space curves under the assumption that the curves are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM), introducing very deep techniques and obtaining very different results from Diaz and Giuffrida. Diaz and Giuffrida also gave initial results in dimensions greater than 3. Here we continue this study for dimension 4. We introduce a number B defined in terms of the degrees of the curves and prove that when both curves lie on a surface of minimal degree (thus a cubic surface) then the number of points of intersection is at most B. Moreover, we conjecture that B is always an upper bound and we prove this conjecture in many cases, including when at least one of the curves is ACM. Our approach focuses on the genera of the curves and their union. In addition we define a second number B' in terms of the degrees and the genus of the union which we can show bounds the number of points of intersection above, and we use a variety of methods to study how B and B' compare.",

This note further generalizes this theorem to include pseudo-similarity transformations, namely products of the form $H^{\\dagger} P H$, where $H$ is a general $N \\times K$ matrix and \"$\\dagger$\" denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse. This implies that, while the product $Q^{H} P Q$ is Hermitian and is generally a deflated version of $P$ (both in dimensionality and in the number of non-zero eigenvalues), this is not the case for $H^{\\dagger} P H$, which, although generally a deflated version of $P$ in terms of the number of non-zero eigenvalues, will not necessarily be so in dimensionality, nor will it in general be Hermitian.

This letter aims to investigate the use of FRIS to enhance physical-layer security in a system, in which a multi-antenna access point (AP) communicates with a legitimate user device in the presence of an eavesdropper. Unlike RIS with fixed-position elements, FRIS can dynamically select an optimal subset of elements from a larger array of candidate locations. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the AP's transmit beamforming, the selection of FRIS activated elements, and their discrete phase shifts. The resulting problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), which is NP-hard. To address this, we propose an efficient algorithm based on an alternating optimization (AO) framework. Within this framework, the beamforming subproblem is optimally solved in closed form using the generalized eigenvalue method, while the combinatorial subproblem of joint element selection and discrete phase design is handled via the cross-entropy optimization (CEO) method. Simulation results show that the proposed FRIS design significantly outperforms the conventional RIS counterpart and other baselines, demonstrating the substantial security gains by element positioning as the new degree of freedom (DoF).",

The metric theory of minimal gaps for the sequence $\\{\u03b1a_n \\text{ mod }1, 1\\leq n \\leq N\\}$ as $N \\to \\infty$ was initiated by Rudnick, who established that the minimal gap admits an asymptotic upper bound expressible in terms of the additive energy of $\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_N\\}$ for almost every $\u03b1$. Later, Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch demonstrated that the metric theory of minimal gaps for such sequences is governed not by the additive energy, but by the cardinality of the difference set of $\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_N\\}$. They established a sharp convergence test for the typical asymptotic order of the minimal gap and proved general upper and lower bounds that are readily applicable. A key element of their proof relies on the resolution of the Duffin--Schaeffer conjecture by Koukoulopoulos and Maynard. In this article, we generalise several results from the article of Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch on \\emph{integer} sequences to the case of \\emph{real} sequences. While an upper bound for $\u03b4_{\\min}^\u03b1(N)$ remains elusive, we obtain one for its floored counterpart $\\lfloor \u03b4^\u03b1_{\\min} \\rfloor (N)$ for real sequences $(a_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ of distinct numbers. Our theorems recover Theorems 1-3, as well as the result from Section 4.3 of the article by Aistleitner, El-Baz, and Munsch. Furthermore, we establish lower bounds for the minimal gaps of well-spaced sequences and, more generally, of a broader family that contains them.",

Under certain hypotheses, we establish its equivalence to a known topological extension of the Zoll property.

Our main result is that for each magnetization $\u03b7$, the free energy density of the fixed-magnetization Ising model converges to the annealed free energy density, itself the Bethe free energy of an Ising measure on the infinite $d$-regular tree. Moreover, the fixed-magnetization Ising model exhibits local weak convergence to this tree measure. A key challenge to proving these results is that for magnetizations between the model's spinodal points, the limiting tree measure corresponds to an unstable fixed point of the belief propagation equations.\n  As an application, we prove that the positive-temperature Zdeborov\u00e1--Boettcher conjecture on max-cut and min-bisection holds up to the reconstruction threshold: on the random $d$-regular graph, the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model plus the expected fraction of bichromatic edges in the zero-magnetization ferromagnetic Ising model equals $1+o(1)$.\n  A second application is completely determining the large deviation rate function for the magnetization in the Ising model on the random regular graph up to reconstruction.\n  Finally, we use the precise understanding of this rate function to show that the Glauber dynamics for the full Ising model on the random graph mixes in sub-exponential time from uniformly random initialization, well into the non-uniqueness regime where the worst-case initialization mixing time is exponentially slow.",

Assuming a Markovian evolution on a discrete state space, the task reduces to estimating the underlying transition probability matrix from distributional data. We formulate this inverse problem within the framework of entropic optimal transport, as a joint optimization over the transition matrix and the transport plans connecting successive distributions. This formulation results in a convex optimization problem, and we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the entropic proximal method. We illustrate the accuracy and convergence of the method in two numerical setups, considering estimation from independent snapshots and estimation from a time series of aggregate observations, respectively.",

    "abstract": "We derive necessary conditions for locally optimal shapes of a design problem governed by a non-smooth PDE. The main particularity of the state system is the lack of differentiability of the nonlinearity. We work in the framework of the functional variational approach (FVA), which has the capacity to transfer geometric optimization problems into optimal control problems, the set of admissible shapes being parametrized by a large class of continuous mappings. In the FVA setting, we introduce a sensitivity analysis technique that is novel even for smooth PDEs. We emphasize that we do not resort to extensions on the hold-all domain or any kind of approximation of the original PDE. The computation of the directional derivative of the state w.r.t. functional variations results in a new way of computing the shape derivative. The presented approach allows us to handle in the objective pointwise observation and derivatives of the state on an observation set as well as distributed observation terms. In addition, we introduce the concept of locally optimal shapes and we put into evidence its connection to locally minimizers of the corresponding control problem. With directional differentiability results for the control-to-state map at our disposal, we can then state necessary conditions for locally optimal shapes in general non-smooth settings.",

Theor. 57(5), 2024, for zero angular momentum is recovered here as a special case, and the analysis is extended to all angular momenta. In this setting, the resonant heavy-light interactions are modeled as point interactions, under the assumption of either exchange symmetry or antisymmetry with respect to the positions of the delta centers. Within this framework, we prove that in the unitary limit the Efimov spectrum depends solely on the mass ratio and particle statistics; that is, the so-called three-body parameter is absent. We also provide a condition ensuring that the spectrum contains no nonEfimov eigenvalues. Furthermore, we study the system away from the unitary limit and show that the spatial size of the weakest bound state near the threshold is approximately 2.8 times the two-body scattering length, in contrast to the common assumption that these two scales coincide. Finally, we compute Bargmann bound for the number of bound states and obtain a sharper estimate than the results in the literature.",
