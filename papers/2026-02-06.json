    "title": "Convergence Rate of the Last Iterate of Stochastic Proximal Algorithms",
    "abstract": "We analyze two classical algorithms for solving additively composite convex optimization problems where the objective is the sum of a smooth term and a nonsmooth regularizer: proximal stochastic gradient method for a single regularizer; and the randomized incremental proximal method, which uses the proximal operator of a randomly selected function when the regularizer is given as the sum of many nonsmooth functions. We focus on relaxing the bounded variance assumption that is common, yet stringent, for getting last iterate convergence rates. We prove the $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate of convergence for the last iterate of both algorithms under componentwise convexity and smoothness, which is optimal up to log terms. Our results apply directly to graph-guided regularizers that arise in multi-task and federated learning, where the regularizer decomposes as a sum over edges of a collaboration graph.",

    "title": "An Adaptive Framework for Robust Structural Shape Optimization under Uncertainty",
    "abstract": "This work proposes an adaptive framework to solve a robust structural shape optimization problem governed by linear elasticity models that account for uncertainties in the loading and material inputs. A posteriori error estimators are constructed to adjust the sample size, mesh size, and step length. The size of the sample set in the stochastic gradient approximation is dynamically determined depending on the variance of the shape derivative. When constructing the a posteriori error estimator in the physical domain, errors arising from the discretization of the deformation bilinear form, which provides a descent direction, are considered, in addition to errors from the discretization of the linear elasticity system. The step length in gradient-based optimization is also adaptively adjusted by estimating the Lipschitz constant of the stochastic shape derivative. Moreover, an analysis of the existence and distributed-form derivation of the stochastic shape derivative is provided. Finally, the proposed estimation-based adaptive stochastic optimization framework is validated on leg-like structural components, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing touchdown compliance under uncertain contact forces.",

When this semi-conjugacy is a homeomorphism, a fundamental problem is to understand the regularity of the conjugacy and its inverse. Contrary to the usual expectation that their H\u00f6lder regularities degenerate simultaneously, we exhibit a strongly asymmetric behavior. For self-similar IETs of hyperbolic periodic type and a natural one-parameter central family of affine IET deformations obtained via a freezing (zero-temperature) limit, the conjugacy becomes arbitrarily irregular while its inverse remains uniformly H\u00f6lder. Using thermodynamic formalism for renormalization and zero-temperature limits, we obtain sharp asymptotics for Hausdorff dimensions of invariant and conformal measures and for the supremal H\u00f6lder exponents of the conjugacy and its inverse.",

The k-VCP is an important problem in network optimization, with applications in infrastructure protection and epidemic containment. We present a new extended integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that unifies and strengthens existing models and serves as the foundation for a new branch-and-price algorithm for the k-VCP. An in-depth theoretical study enables us to devise algorithmic components such as tailored branching rules that preserve the structure of the pricing problems, as well as valid inequalities and symmetry-handling techniques. We also show that our new model dominates all previous ILP formulations of the k-VCP in terms of their linear relaxations, which theoretically justifies the computational effectiveness of our approach. Extensive computational experiments against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate substantially improved performance, both in terms of instances solved to proven optimality and running times. On the full benchmark of 608 instances, our algorithm consistently outperforms all competitors and is able to solve 73 previously unsolved instances within the time limit of one hour.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we consider a class of optimization problems constrained to the generalized Stiefel manifold. Such problems are fundamental to a wide range of real-world applications, including generalized canonical correlation analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and electronic structure calculations. Existing works mainly focuses on cases where the generalized orthogonality constraint is induced by a symmetric positive definite matrix M, a setting where the geometry essentially reduces to that of the standard Stiefel manifold. However, many practical scenarios involve a singular M, which introduces significant analytical and computational challenges. Therefore, we propose a Smooth Locally Exact Penalty model (SLEP) and establish its equivalence to the original problem in the aspect of stationary points under a finitly large penalty parameter. This penalty model admits the direct application of various unconstrained optimization techniques, with convergence guarantees inherited from established results. Compared to Riemannian optimization approaches, our proposed penalty mode eliminates the need for retractions and vector transports, hence significantly reducing per-iteration computational costs. Extensive numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness and practical potential of the proposed penalty model SLEP.",

The proposed operators are shown to be well defined, uniformly bounded, and to satisfy an exact interpolation property at the grid points. In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Direct approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular partitions, including Lagrange-based schemes.",

The latter assumption allows us to solve structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems.

Under a linear-dominance condition on each cylinder, ball images are explicit and locally affine, leading to a robust classification of discrete behavior into contractive, indifferent, and expansive regimes. Good reduction provides a selection principle for natural interpreters; effective degree and height bounds for general rational interpreters remain open.\n  For composite alphabets we prove a \\textbf{Dynamic Chinese Remainder Theorem} for congruence-preserving systems: the CRT isomorphism $\u0398:\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}\\xrightarrow{\\sim}\\prod_i\\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{k_i}\\mathbb{Z}$ (for $m=\\prod p_i^{k_i}$) yields a factorization of the \\emph{dynamics} (equivalently, the functional graph) on $\\mathbb{Z}/m\\mathbb{Z}$ into dynamics on the prime-power components, compatible with reduction.

We provide a useful characterization of this property for spectral functions by demonstrating that it can be characterized via the same property of the symmetric part of the spectral representation of an eigenvalue function. Our approach allows us to bypass the rather restrictive convexity assumption, used in many recent works that targeted second-order variational properties of spectral functions. By this theoretical tool, several applications on the proto-differentiability of subgradient mappings, the directional differentiability of the proximal mapping of spectral functions are achieved.

Inspired by recent works of Feng et al. \\cite{fb20} and Long et al. \\cite{fb5}, we propose a new free boundary condition, where the expansion rate of the epidemic region, determined by $h'(t)$ and $g'(t)$, is proportional to a linear combination of the outward flux of the pathogen \\(u\\) through the range boundary (as in \\cite{fb27}) and the weighted total population of infected individuals \\(v\\) within the region (as in \\cite{fb5}). We prove that the system under this new free boundary condition is well-posed, and its long-time dynamical behavior is characterized by a spreading-vanishing dichotomy. Moreover, we obtain sharp criteria for this dichotomy, including a sharp threshold in terms of the initial data $(u_0,v_0)$; and by studying a related eigenvalue problem, we also find a sharp threshold in terms of the diffusion rate, which complements related results in Nguyen and Vo \\cite{fb7}. This is Part $1$ of a two part series. In Part $2$, we will determine the spreading speed of the model when spreading occurs, and for some typical classes of kernel functions, we will obtain the precise rates of accelerated spreading.",

Nevertheless, whether 6-connected 1-planar graphs admit near-perfect matchings remains largely open. The prior art established this for 4-connected 1-planar graphs only when each crossing involves four endpoints that induce a $K_4$. In this paper, we study 6-connected 1-planar graphs that are drawn such that at all crossings the four endpoints induce a 4-cycle (plus perhaps more edges). We show that these have a near-perfect matching, and in fact even stronger, their scattering number is at most one. Moreover, under the local crossing restriction, the requirement of 6-connectivity is best possible; this is witnessed by explicit constructions due to Biedl and Fabrici et al.",

This implication is shown in the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet Spaces introduced by the author and Murugan, and thus a unified treatment becomes possible to proving Harnack inequalities and stability phenomena in both analysis on metric spaces and fractals and for graphs and manifolds for all exponents $p\\in (1,\\infty)$. As an application, we also show that a Dirichlet space satisfying volume doubling, Poincar\u00e9 and upper capacity bounds has finite martingale dimension and admits a type of differential structure similar to the work of Cheeger.

The method uses the relation between $sl$ and $so$ representations given by the vertical-sum operation, and the dual relation between $sl$ and $sp$ representations given by the horizontal-sum operation on the corresponding Young diagrams. The usual quantum dimensions of these three representations, together with subtleties related to the invariance of universal formulae under automorphisms of the $sl$ Dynkin diagram, allow one to determine the $\u03b3$-independent factors of a universal quantum dimension (note that $\u03b3$ is the only parameter for classical algebras, depending on their rank). Using this approach, we compute the $\u03b3$-independent factors for (known) adjoints' universal quantum dimension, and also obtain such a factor in one new case. We discuss how to extend this approach to the $\u03b3$-dependent factors in the quantum dimension formulae, and other issues. This is another instance in which calculations purely within the classical algebras predict the answers for the exceptional cases, due to the hidden universality structure of the theory of simple Lie algebras.",

We incorporate logarithmic barrier functions into the stage cost to enforce box constraints (upper and lower bounds on variables), yielding a smooth interior-point formulation that integrates seamlessly with the standard iLQR backward-forward pass. The Hessian contributions from the log barriers are positive definite, preserving and enhancing the positive definiteness of the quadratic approximations in iLQR and providing an intrinsic regularization effect that improves numerical stability and convergence. Moreover, since the negative logarithm is convex, the addition of log barrier terms preserves convexity if the cost is already convex. We further analyze how the barrier-augmented iLQR naturally adapts feedback gains near constraint boundaries. In particular, at convergence, the feedback terms associated with saturated control channels go to zero, recovering a purely feedforward behavior whenever control is saturated. Numerical examples on constrained nonlinear control problems demonstrate that the proposed method reliably respects box constraints and maintains favorable convergence properties.",

Our method is based on a Galerkin discretisation of the Lippmann-Schwinger volume integral equation, using a discontinuous piecewise-polynomial approximation space on a geometry-conforming mesh comprising elements which themselves have fractal boundary. We first provide a semi-discrete well-posedness and error analysis for both the $h$- and $p$-versions of our method for completely arbitrary inhomogeneities (without any regularity assumption on the boundary of the inhomogeneity or of the mesh elements). We prove convergence estimates for the integral equation solution and superconvergence estimates for linear functionals such as scattered field and far-field pattern evaluations, and elucidate how the regularity of the inhomogeneity boundary and the regularity of the refractive index affect the rates of convergence predicted. We then specialise to the case where the inhomogeneity is an ``$n$-attractor'', i.e.\\ the fractal attractor of an iterated function system satisfying the open set condition with non-empty interior, showing how in this case the self-similarity of the inhomogeneity can be used to generate geometry-conforming meshes. For the $h$-version with piecewise constant approximation we also present singular quadrature rules, supported by a fully discrete error analysis, permitting practical implementation of our method. We present numerical results for two-dimensional examples, which validate our theoretical results and show that our method is significantly more accurate than a comparable method involving replacement of the fractal inhomogeneity by a smoother prefractal approximation.",

In contrast to classical MDPs, which account for stochasticity by modeling the dynamics through a stochastic process with a known transition kernel, a robust MDP additionally accounts for ambiguity by optimizing against the most adverse transition kernel from an ambiguity set constructed via historical data. In this paper, we develop a unified solution framework for a broad class of robust MDPs with $s$-rectangular ambiguity sets, where the most adverse transition probabilities are considered independently for each state. Using our algorithms, we show that $s$-rectangular robust MDPs with $1$- and $2$-norm as well as $\u03c6$-divergence ambiguity sets can be solved several orders of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art commercial solvers, and often only a logarithmic factor slower than classical MDPs.

    "title": "Low-complexity Design for Beam Coverage in Near-field and Far-field: A Fourier Transform Approach",
    "abstract": "In this paper, we study efficient beam coverage design for multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field cases. To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.",

Moreover, the exponential convergence of the uniaxial PML method is established in terms of the thickness and absorbing parameters of PML layer. The proof is based on the PML extension technique and the exponential decay properties of the modified fundamental solution.

    "abstract": "Optimizing smooth convex functions in stochastic settings, where only noisy estimates of gradients and Hessians are available, is a fundamental problem in optimization. While first-order methods possess a low per-iteration cost, their convergence is slow for ill-conditioned problems. Stochastic Newton methods utilize second-order information to correct for local curvature, but the O(d 3 ) per-iteration cost of computing and inverting a full Hessian, where d is the problem dimension, is prohibitive in high dimensions. This paper introduces an online mini-batch stochastic Newton algorithm. The method employs a random masking strategy that selects a subset of Hessian columns at each iteration, substantially reducing the per-step computational cost. This approach allows the algorithm, in the mini-batch setting, to achieve a total computational cost for a single pass over N data points of O(N d), which is comparable to first-order methods while retaining the advantages of second-order information. We establish the almost sure convergence and asymptotic efficiency of the resulting estimator. This property is obtained without requiring iterate averaging, which distinguishes this work from prior analyses.",

To address these issues, this paper proposes a Piecewise Affine (PWA)-based distributed scheme for Model Predictive Control (MPC) that optimizes energy and comfort through PWA-based quadratic programming. We utilize the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for effective decomposition and apply the PWA technique to handle the nonlinear components. To solve the resulting large-scale nonconvex problems, the paper introduces a convex ADMM algorithm that transforms the nonconvex problem into a series of smaller convex problems, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the convex ADMM algorithm converges to a local optimum of the original problem. A case study involving 36 zones validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

We derive an absorbed, fully mechanistic diffusion approximation and its extinction structure from a continuous-time Markov chain on $\\mathbb N_0^2$ with four reaction channels: prey birth, prey competition death, predator death, and a coupled predation--conversion event. Absorbing coordinate axes are imposed to represent the irreversibility of demographic extinction. Under Kurtz density-dependent scaling, the law-of-large-numbers limit recovers the classical RM ODE, while central-limit scaling yields a chemical-Langevin diffusion with explicit drift and full state-dependent covariance. A distinctive signature is the strictly negative cross-covariance $\u03a3_{12}(N,P)=-mNP/(1+N)$ induced solely by the predation--conversion increment $(-1,1)$. We define the absorbed It\u00f4 SDE by freezing trajectories at the first boundary hit and prove strong well-posedness, non-explosion, and moment bounds up to absorption.

In this paper, we introduce and develop the theory of tilted Richardson varieties $\\mathrm{T}_{u,v}$, a new family of subvarieties of the flag variety that provides a geometric framework for the quantum Bruhat graphs. These varieties are defined for all pairs of permutations $u$ and $v$, extending the classical Richardson varieties in the case where $u\\leq v$ in the Bruhat order. We establish their fundamental geometric properties, proving irreducibility and providing explicit dimension formulas. Moreover, we show that they have a well-defined stratification indexed by tilted Bruhat intervals, a generalization of classical Bruhat intervals previously introduced by Brenti, Fomin, and Postnikov. Additionally, we introduce a tilted generalization of the classical Deodhar decomposition of Richardson varieties, which leads to a combinatorial formula for tilted Kazhdan--Lusztig R-polynomials, a notion that arises naturally in our framework.\n  We further develop a theory of total positivity for tilted Richardson varieties. In particular, we define and study the totally nonnegative parts of tilted Richardson varieties, proving they form a CW complex. This generalizes earlier results on the totally nonnegative flag variety and answers Bj\u00f6rner's questions regarding geometric realizations of tilted Bruhat intervals.\n  Finally, we establish explicit connections between tilted Richardson varieties and quantum Schubert calculus. Specifically, we prove that $\\mathrm{T}_{u,v}$ coincides with minimal-degree two-point curve neighborhoods. As a result, we compute their cohomology classes and derive new relationships among Gromov--Witten invariants of the flag variety.",

For $\u03b1>1/2$, we say that an odd prime $p$ is partially regular if the eigenspaces of the $p$-Sylow subgroup of $\\operatorname{Cl}(K_p)$ under the Galois action vanish for all characters $\u03c9^{p-2k}$ with \\[ 2\\le 2k \\le \\frac{\\sqrt{p}}{(\\log p)^\u03b1}. \\] Equivalently, $p\\nmid \\operatorname{num}(B_{2k})$ throughout this range. We prove that a density-one subset of primes is partially regular in this sense. By Leopoldt reflection, this yields a partial Vandiver Theorem: for a density-one set of primes $p$, the even eigenspaces $A_p(\u03c9^{2k})$ vanish for all even $2k$ satisfying the inequality above. This result has consequences for Kubota-Leopoldt $p$-adic $L$-functions, congruences between cusp forms and Eisenstein series, and $p$-torsion in algebraic $K$-groups. The theorem proving partial regularity for almost all $p$ is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the conjecture.",

These ensembles are governed by sequences of nonnegative parameters that encode the asymptotic slopes of the curves at positive and negative infinity. Our main results characterize the fluctuations around this leading-order behavior and establish functional limit theorems for the ensembles near both ends of the spatial axis.\n  We show that, at a macroscopic level, an Airy wanderer line ensemble organizes into groups of finitely many curves sharing a common asymptotic slope. After appropriate centering and scaling, each such group converges to a Dyson Brownian motion whose dimension equals the size of the group. In the case where only finitely many slope parameters are positive, we further prove a curve separation phenomenon: the upper curves follow deterministic parabolic trajectories, while the remaining lower curves remain globally flat and converge to the classical Airy line ensemble.",

    "abstract": "The sum-rank metric is the mixture of the Hamming and rank metrics. The sum-rank metric found its application in network coding, locally repairable codes, space-time coding, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Linearized Reed-Solomon (LRS) codes are the sum-rank analogue of Reed-Solomon codes and strictly generalize both Reed-Solomon and Gabidulin codes.\n  In this work, we construct an explicit family of $\\mathbb{F}_h$-linear sum-rank metric codes over arbitrary fields $\\mathbb{F}_h$. Our construction enables efficient list decoding up to a fraction $\u03c1$ of errors in the sum-rank metric with rate $1-\u03c1-\\varepsilon$, for any desired $\u03c1\\in (0,1)$ and $\\varepsilon>0$. Our codes are subcodes of LRS codes, obtained by restricting message polynomials to an $\\mathbb{F}_h$-subspace derived from subspace designs, and the decoding list size is bounded by $h^{\\mathrm{poly}(1/\\varepsilon)}$.\n  Beyond the standard LRS setting, we further extend our linear-algebraic decoding framework to folded Linearized Reed-Solomon (FLRS) codes. We show that folded evaluations satisfy appropriate interpolation conditions and that the corresponding solution space forms a low-dimensional, structured affine subspace. This structure enables effective control of the list size and yields the first explicit positive-rate FLRS subcodes that are efficiently list decodable beyond the unique-decoding radius. To the best of our knowledge, this also constitutes the first explicit construction of positive-rate sum-rank metric codes that admit efficient list decoding beyond the unique decoding radius, thereby providing a new general framework for constructing efficiently decodable codes under the sum-rank metric.",

The argument is based on a boundary iteration scheme: an initial H\u00f6lder modulus for the boundary trace (coming from quasiconformality) is improved via the $C^{1,\u03b1}$ graph representation of $\\partial\u03a9$, yielding higher H\u00f6lder regularity for the normal component. This boundary gain is converted into a near-boundary gradient bound for harmonic functions through a basepoint boundary H\u00f6lder-to-gradient estimate obtained by flattening the boundary and using local harmonic-measure bounds. Quasiconformality then propagates the resulting control from one component to the full differential, and iteration gives boundedness of $|Df|$ up to the boundary. Along the way we briefly survey several standard tools from the theory of quasiconformal harmonic mappings (QCH), including boundary H\u00f6lder continuity, distortion of derivatives, and boundary-to-interior propagation principles that enter the iteration.",

The free boundaries $x=g(t)$ and $x=h(t)$ evolve subject to a ``preferred population density\" condition at the habitat edges. Analogous to the traveling wave solutions in the corresponding Cauchy problem, semi-wave solutions play a fundamental role in understanding the propagation phenomena governed by the free boundary problem here. But in contrast to the Cauchy problem, where the KPP condition plays a subtle role in the precise approximation of its solution (with compactly supported initial function) by the traveling wave solution with minimal speed, here we prove the existence and uniqueness of a semi-wave in a general monostable setting, and obtain a precise description of the convergence of the solution toward the semi-wave as time goes to infinity, where the KPP condition plays no special role. Previously, such a sharp result was proved for a free boundary model only when $f$ is autonomous ($f=f(u)$, see \\cite{D} or \\cite{DL15} for a related free boundary model), or a less precise result was obtained in the time-periodic case under an extra strong KPP condition on $f$ (see \\cite{MDW}, or \\cite{DGP} for a related free boundary model). This work appears to be the first to prove the sharp convergence result for a general monostable free boundary problem in a heterogeneous environment, and we believe the methods developed here should have applications to related free boundary problems in heterogeneous media with nonlinearities more general than those of KPP type.",

Our framework learns directly from past solutions and incorporates the known components, such as hard constraints, via a constraint reasoning module, yielding a constrained learning scheme. The trained model generates new solutions that are structurally similar to past solutions and are guaranteed to respect the known constraints. We apply our approach to three combinatorial optimization problems with unknown components: the knapsack problem with an unknown reward function, the bipartite matching problem with an unknown objective function, and the single-machine scheduling problem with release times and unknown precedence constraints, with the objective of minimizing average completion time. We demonstrate that transformer models have remarkably strong performance and often produce near-optimal solutions in a fraction of a second. They can be particularly effective in the presence of more complex underlying objective functions and unknown implicit constraints compared to an LSTM-based alternative and inverse optimization.",

    "title": "From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization",
    "abstract": "A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.",

    "title": "Correcting Contextual Deletions in DNA Nanopore Readouts",
    "abstract": "The problem of designing codes for deletion-correction and synchronization has received renewed interest due to applications in DNA-based data storage systems that use nanopore sequencers as readout platforms. In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\\log n$ for a constant $C\\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C>1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.",

We compare implementations using the analytic Frechet derivative of this map with a simple central-difference approximation. Because the method does not rely on time evolution, it is agnostic to dynamical stability and can detect both stable and unstable stationary states. Its accuracy is determined mainly by the numerical treatment of convolutions and quadrature, rather than by differentiation stencils.

Such groups are non-commutative and typical examples of sub-Riemannian manifolds. Moreover, we apply the results for this equation to its dual equation (i.e., the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in the general form), and derive the existence, uniqueness and regularity of its weak solution. To obtain the regularity results for solutions to the linear parabolic equation and its dual equation, firstly, we construct several families of mollifiers adapted respectively to the H\u00f6rmander vector fields generating Carnot groups, Carnot tori and dual spaces of non-isotropic H\u00f6lder spaces; secondly, we use the theory of singular integral operators to establish stronger a priori regularity for the solutions.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel double regularization scheme for bilevel optimization problems whose lower-level problem is composite and convex, but not necessarily strongly convex, in the lower-level variable. The analysis focuses on the primal-dual solution mapping of the regularized lower-level problem and exploits its properties to derive an almost-everywhere formula for the gradient of the regularized hyper-objective under mild assumptions. The paper then establishes conditions under which the hyper-objective of the actual problem is well defined and shows that its gradient can be approximated by the gradient of the regularized hyper-objective. Building on these results, a gradient sampling-based algorithm computes approximately stationary points of the regularized hyper-objective, and we prove its convergence to stationary points of the actual problem. Two numerical examples from machine learning demonstrate the proposed approach.",

    "title": "Enabling Large-Scale Channel Sounding for 6G: A Framework for Sparse Sampling and Multipath Component Extraction",
    "abstract": "Realizing the 6G vision of artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) critically requires large-scale real-world channel datasets for channel modeling and data-driven AI models. However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\\times$ faster measurement, a 98\\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.",

However, their convergence behavior under grid refinement is still not well understood from the viewpoint of numerical analysis. In this work, we propose a numerically informed convolutional operator network, called NICON, that explicitly couples classical finite difference and finite element methods with operator learning through residual-based training loss functions. We introduce two types of networks, FD-CON and FE-CON, which use residual-based loss functions derived from the corresponding numerical methods. We derive error estimates for FD-CON and FE-CON using finite difference and finite element analysis. These estimates show a direct relation between the convergence behavior and the decay rate of the training loss. From these analyses, we establish training strategies that guarantee optimal convergence rates under grid refinement. Several numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results and show performance on fine grids.",

To overcome these difficulties, instead of directly considering the HSM inequality on the upper half space, we establish the existence of an extremal for its equivalent version: Poincar\u00e9-Sobolev inequality on the hyperbolic space. We develop a novel duality theory of the minimizing sequences, the concentration-compactness principle for radial functions in the hyperbolic setting, which combines with the Helgason-Fourier analysis and the Riesz rearrangement inequality on the hyperbolic space, to resolve the lack of compactness issue. As an application, we also obtain the existence of positive symmetric solutions for the high order Brezis-Nirenberg equation on the entire hyperbolic space associated with the GJMS operators $P_k$ (i.e., when $k\\ge 2$): $$ P_{k}\\left(f\\right)-\u03b1f=|f|^{p-2}f $$ at the critical situation $\u03b1=\\prod\\limits_{i=1}^{k}\\frac{\\left(2i-1\\right)^2}{4}$ when either $2k+2\\leq n$ and $p=\\frac{2n}{n-2k}$ or $2k<n$ and $2<p<\\frac{2n}{n-2k}$.",

We show that when the population growth rate exceeds a critical threshold, a single harvesting strategy can simultaneously maximize both objectives.

Leveraging this framework, we define stable and filtered gradient flows for large swarms, paying special attention to optimal transport algorithms. Further, we show how to derive agent-level, microscopical algorithms that are consistent with macroscopic counterparts in the large-scale limit.

In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and demonstrate their super resolution in time. Finally the proposed MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically convergence rates of the NKGE to its different limiting models in the nonrelativistic regime.",

    "title": "Objective-Function Free Multi-Objective Optimization: Rate of Convergence and Performance of an Adagrad-like algorithm",
    "abstract": "We propose an Adagrad-like algorithm for multi-objective unconstrained optimization that relies on the computation of a common descent direction only. Unlike classical local algorithms for multi-objective optimization, our approach does not rely on the dominance property to accept new iterates, which allows for a flexible and function-free optimization framework. New points are obtained using an adaptive stepsize that does not require neither knowledge of Lipschitz constants nor the use of line search procedures. The rate of convergence is analyzed and is shown to be $\\mathcal{O}(1 / \\sqrt{ k+1})$ with respect to the norm of the common descent direction. The method is extensively validated on a broad class of unconstrained multi-objective problems and simple multi-task learning instances, and compared against a first-order line search algorithm. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of the behavior under noisy multi-objective settings, highlighting the robustness of the method.",

    "abstract": "We make some elementary observations about relative categoricity and the Gaifman property. T will be a complete theory in a countable language L with a distinguished unary predicate P. We will assume L is relational and T has quantifier elimination. For M a model of of T, M^P is the substructure of M with universe P(M), and T^P is the common L-theory of these M^P. T is said to be relatively categorical if for any models M_1, M_2 of T any isomorphism between M_1^P and M_2^P lifts to an isomorphism between M_1 and M_2. T has the Gaifman property (or P-existence) if every model of T^P is of the form M^P for a model M of T. It was conjectured that if T is relatively categorical then T has the Gaifman property. T is said to be relatively (omega, omega) categorical if relative categoricity holds when restricted to countable models of T. We observe that (i) if T is relatively (omega, omega) categorical then any model of T^P of cardinality at most aleph_1 is of the form M^P for M a model of T, and (ii) if in addition every model M of T is in the algebraic closure of P(M) together with a (finite) subset of M, then T is relatively categorical and has the Gaifman property.",

This phenomenon is demonstrated by a careful analysis of the representation formula for the Stokes system in the half-space, including pointwise estimates, based on the Green tensor with nonzero boundary data. We construct solutions of the Stokes system such that the tangential components of the velocity field exhibit at least one sign change, while the normal component exhibits at least two sign changes.

    "abstract": "For quasi-linear interface problems with discontinuous diffusion coefficients, the nonconvex objective functional often leads to optimization stagnation in randomized neural network approximations. This paper Proposes a perturbation-correction framework based on Loacal Randomized Neural Networks(LRaNNs) to overcome this limitation. In the initialization step, a satisisfactory based approximation is obtained by minimizing the original nonconvex residual, typically stagnating at a moderate accuracy level. Subsequently, in the correction step, a correction term is determined by solving a subproblem governed by a perturbation expansion around the base approximation. This reformulation yields a convex optimization problem for the output coefficients, which guarantees rapic convergence. We rigorously derive an a posteriori error estitmate, demonstrating that the total generalization error is governed by the discrete residual norm, quadrature error, and a controllable truncation error. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion problems with irregular moving interfaces, gradient-dependent diffusivities, and high-contrast media demonstrate that the proposed method effectively overcomes the optimization plateau. The correction step yields a significant improvement of 4-6 order of magnitude in L^2 accuracy.",

    "abstract": "While intersections of convex sets are convex, their unions have rather complicated behavior. Some natural contexts where they appear include duality arguments involving boundaries of convex sets and valuations, which have an Euler characteristic-like structure. However, there are certain settings where the convexity property itself is important to consider. For example, this includes (preservation of) positivity properties of divisors on toric varieties under blowdowns. In the case of (restrictions of) conormal bundles, this can be interpreted in terms of interactions between local convexity data stored in rational equivalence relations. We consider generalizations to realizations of simplicial pseudomanifolds and replace rational equivalence with effects of PL homeomorphisms.\n  Decomposing the PL homeomorphisms into edge subdivisions and contractions, we characterize the space of suitable contraction points compatible with local convexity properties in terms of convex unions and completions. This gives rise to certain external edge subdivisions that make this ``contraction space'' of the starting edge empty, which is unexpected given the expected ``increased convexity'' from edge subdivisions. We also obtain strong affine/linear restrictions on realizations of facets containing nearby edges preserving local convexity. This implies that contracting certain nearby edges results in a very large or very small contraction space of the starting edge. As for boundary behavior, there are parallels between effects of PL homeomorphisms on induced 4-cycles in the 1-skeleton. Finally, we find effects of PL homeomorphisms and suspensions on analogues of local convexity properties stored by linear systems of parameters. This indicates that simplicial spheres PL homeomorphic to the boundary of a cross polytope store record local convexity changes in the most natural way.",

Here we focus on the minimality of the realizations of vector sets with respect to their edge sets. On the one hand, we study conditions under which it is possible to remove an edge from the graph and keep the realizability condition. This provides a method for finding minimal realizations, as well as allowing us to characterize uniquely realizable vector sets. On the other hand, we prove that the decision problem of realizing a vector set by a graph with a given number of edges is an NP-complete problem. Finally, we characterize the vector sets that are realizable by a tree and, furthermore, we study the case in which such a realization is the only one.",

We analyze how demand non-stationarity affects learning performance across inventory models, including systems with demand backlogging or lost-sales, both with and without lead times. For each setting, we propose an adaptive online algorithm that optimizes over the class of base-stock policies and establish performance guarantees in terms of dynamic regret relative to the optimal base-stock policy at each time step. Our results reveal a sharp separation across inventory models. In backlogging systems and lost-sales models with zero lead time, we show that it is possible to adapt to demand changes without incurring additional performance loss in stationary environments, even without prior knowledge of the demand distributions or the number of demand shifts. In contrast, for lost-sales systems with positive lead times, we establish weaker guarantees that reflect fundamental limitations imposed by delayed replenishment in combination with censored feedback. Our algorithms leverage the convexity and one-sided feedback structure of inventory costs to enable counterfactual policy evaluation despite demand censoring. We complement the theoretical analysis with simulation results showing that our methods significantly outperform existing benchmarks.",

Introduced by Borgwardt, Finhold and Hemmecke (SIDMA 2015), it is a relaxation of the combinatorial diameter of a polyhedron. These two notions of diameter lower bound the number of iterations taken by circuit augmentation algorithms and the simplex method respectively for solving linear programs.\n  Recently, an analogous lower bound for path-following interior point methods was introduced by Allamigeon, Dadush, Loho, Natura and V\u00e9gh (SICOMP 2025). Termed straight line complexity, it refers to the minimum number of pieces of any piecewise linear curve that traverses a specified neighborhood of the central path.\n  In this paper, we study the relationship between circuit diameter and straight line complexity. For a polyhedron $P:=\\{x\\in \\mathbb{R}^n: Ax = b, x\\geq \\mathbf{0}\\}$, we show that its circuit diameter is up to a $\\mathrm{poly}(n)$ factor upper bounded by the straight line complexity of linear programs defined over $P$.

Unlike the original \u03c6-FEM formulation, the method proposed here enforces boundary conditions through a penalization term. This approach has the advantage that the level-set function is required only on the cells adjacent to the boundary in the variational formulation. The scheme is stabilized using a ghost penalty technique. We derive a priori error estimates, showing optimal convergence in the H1 semi-norm and quasi-optimal convergence in the L2 norm under suitable regularity assumptions.

While computing nonnegative integer rank is generally very hard, we focus on a fundamental special case: determining when a rank 2 nonnegative integer matrix has nonnegative integer rank equal to 2 (the \"rank2 problem\"). Although this problem is trivial in the continuous case, in this context it is surprisingly rich.\n  We provide a geometric reformulation in terms of affine semigroups and rational cones in the plane, which yields new structural insights. We show that any rank 2 integer matrix can be reduced to a $3\\times 3$ matrix which has nonnegative integer rank $2$ if and only if the original one also has nonnegative integer rank $2$, with the reduction computable in polynomial time. This reduction reveals that the difficulty of the rank2 problem is already captured by small matrices. Building on this geometric framework, we also develop an algorithm that solves the rank2 problem by strategically searching for integer generators within bounded regions of the associated cone. Although the theoretical worst-case complexity remains high, numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm performs efficiently in practice.",

This construction should be seen as an extension of the bosonisation phenomenon, and to the best of our knowledge its existence has not been predicted before.\n  We arrive at our main result in the continuum by studying novel discrete structures. Our starting point is a coupling resembling the Edwards-Sokal coupling between the Ising model and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster model, though with role of the latter played by a different percolation model obtained from the double random current model.

Information theory demonstrates that an optimal algorithm for reducing precision of $W$ depends on the (second order) statistics of $X$ and requires a careful alignment of vector quantization codebook with PCA directions of $X$ (a process known as \"waterfilling allocation''). Dependence of the codebook on statistics of $X$, however, is highly impractical. This paper proves that there exist a universal codebook that is simultaneously near-optimal for all possible statistics of $X$, in the sense of being at least as good as an $X$-adapted waterfilling codebook with rate reduced by 0.11 bit per dimension. Such universal codebook would be an ideal candidate for the low-precision storage format, a topic of active modern research, but alas the existence proof is non-constructive.\n  Equivalently, our result shows existence of a net in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ that is a nearly-optimal covering of a sphere simultaneously with respect to all Hilbert norms.",

These mixed sign problems have appeared in statistical inference setting as a way to generalize least squares regression to measure valued outputs and have appeared in numerical methods to improve the accuracy of Wasserstein gradient flow solvers. Unfortunately, the presence of negatively weighted distance terms destroys the Euclidean convexity of the unsigned problem, resulting in a much more challenging optimization task. The main focus of this work is to study properties of the signed barycenter problem for a general transport cost with a focus on establishing uniqueness of solutions. In particular, when there is only one positive weight, we extend the uniqueness result of Tornabene et al. (2025) to any cost satisfying a certain convexity property. In the case of arbitrary weights, we introduce the dual problem in terms of Kantorovich potentials and provide a sufficient condition for a stationary solution of the dual problem to induce an optimal signed barycenter.",

Some properties of the Taylor coefficients of the lower incomplete gamma function at infinity seem to be new. Specifically, these coefficients can be expressed in terms of Touchard polynomials. Furthermore, these same coefficients can be used to reformulate the functional equation for Dirichlet $L$-functions. This relationship \"explains\"' why $\\vert L_\u03c7(1/2+i t)\\vert $ should be small. To present the new ideas in a nutshell, we start by giving (in Section 1) a \"formula proof\" of the Lindel\u00f6f hypothesis. This is not a genuine proof, as we are not concerned with the convergence of our series nor do we justify changing the order of summation. In Section 2, we suggest some hypothetical ways of transforming the \"proof\" from Section 1 into a rigorous mathematical proof. Sections 3-5 contain some technical details and bibliographical references.",

    "abstract": "Heteroclinic connections between two distinct hyperbolic periodic orbits in conservative systems are important in a wide range of applications. On the other hand, it is theoretically challenging to find large amplitude connections from scratch and compute them numerically. In this paper, we use a codimension two singularity, in a family of periodic orbits, as an organizing center for the emergence of heteroclinic connections. A normal form is derived whose unfolding produces two distinct finite amplitude periodic orbits with an explicit heteroclinic connection. We also construct heteroclinic connections far from the singularity by numerical continuation, using two numerical strategies: shooting and the core-farfield decomposition. A key geometric tool in the numerics is cylindrical foliations for the stable and unstable manifolds and their intersection. We introduce a new property of heteroclinic connections - the action - and show it is an invariant along foliations, it has a jump at a surface of section, and it appears in a central way in the normal form theory. We find that the difference in asymptotic phase between minus and plus infinity is also a key property. The theory is applied to the Swift-Hohenberg equation, the nonlinear Schrodinger with fourth order dispersion, and coupled Boussinesq equations from water waves, all of which have an energy and action conservation law.",

While this dual reformulation guarantees convergence with mixed-integer state variables, it admits multiple optimal solutions that can yield weak cuts. To address this issue, we propose normalizing the dual in the extended space to identify solutions that yield stronger cuts. We prove that the resulting normalized cuts are tight and Pareto-optimal in the original state space. We further compare normalization with existing regularization-based approaches for handling dual degeneracy and explain why normalization offers key advantages. In particular, we show that normalization can recover any cut obtained via regularization, whereas the converse does not hold. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods by consistently yielding stronger cuts and reducing solution times on harder instances.",
