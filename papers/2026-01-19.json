    "title": "Notes on countable frames",
    "abstract": "Matthew de Brecht raised the question of whether countable frames are continuous lattices. We prove that the continuity of a countable frame implies the quasicontinuity of its corresponding spectrum in the dual specialization order. We further show that this question admits a positive answer if the frame's spectrum is a $T_1$ space or a Scott space. In general, we confirm the existence of non-continuous countable frames. This work also partially addresses an open problem proposed by Jimmie Lawson and Michael Mislove in 1990, which concerns the characterization of when the spectrums of spatial frames are Scott spaces.",

    "title": "Asymmetric Encoding-Decoding Schemes for Lossless Data Compression",
    "abstract": "This paper proposes a new lossless data compression coding scheme named an asymmetric encoding-decoding scheme (AEDS), which can be considered as a generalization of tANS (tabled variant of asymmetric numeral systems). In the AEDS, a data sequence $\\bm{s}=s_1s_2\\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \\cdots, 2,1$, while $\\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \\cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.",

    "title": "A Non-compact Positivity-Preserving Scheme for Parabolic PDE via Conditional Expectation",
    "abstract": "We propose a novel non-compact, positivity-preserving scheme for linear non-divergence form parabolic equations. Based on the Feynman-Kac formula, the solution is expressed as a conditional expectation of an associated diffusion process. Instead of using compact Markov chain approximations, we employ a wide stencil scheme to approximate the conditional expectation, ensuring consistency and positivity preservation. This method is effective for anisotropic diffusion with mixed derivatives, where classical schemes often fail unless the covariance matrix is diagonally dominated.\n  A key feature of our framework is its robust treatment of boundary conditions, which avoids the accuracy loss commonly encountered in BZ and semi-Lagrangian schemes. For Dirichlet boundaries, we introduce (i) a quad-tree non-uniform stopping time scheme with O($\u0394t^{1/2}$) accuracy and (ii) a quad-tree uniform stopping time scheme with O($\u0394t$) accuracy. For Neumann boundaries, we use discrete specular reflection with O($\u0394t^{1/2}$) convergence, while periodic boundaries are treated using modular wrapping, achieving O($\u0394t$) accuracy. All analyses are conducted under the practical scaling $\u0394t \\sim h$.\n  Except for the uniform stopping time scheme, all schemes are explicit. The schemes are unconditionally stable and positive preserving, thanks to the probabilistic structure. To ensure consistency, a non-compact stencil is involved, which leads to the large time step constraint $\u0394t \\sim h$. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted $L^\\infty$ convergence rates for all types of boundary conditions.",

    "abstract": "A map is a cellular decomposition of a closed surface. In the framework of classifying all regular maps by their supporting surface, it is an open problem to find all closed surfaces that support no regular maps. Classification of regular maps on surfaces with Euler characteristic $-p, -p^2, -p^3, -2p,$ and $-3p$ has already been done by several authors in a series of papers, which also show that surfaces with these Euler characteristic support no regular maps if the corresponding prime $p$ satisfies certain conditions. In this paper, assuming that $p\\geq 5$ is a prime and $i\\geq 4$, we show that the order of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of a regular map with Euler characteristic $-p^i$ is bounded by $p^{i-1}$ unless $p\\in \\{5, 7, 13\\}$, and we show the existence of a normal $p$-subgroup for these regular maps whenever a Sylow $p$-subgroup has order at least $\\sqrt{p^i}$, laying a solid foundation for using an inductive method to completely characterize regular maps of Euler characteristic $-p^i$. Based on this, we classify all regular maps with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ for a prime $p\\geq 5$ in terms of reduced presentations of their automorphism groups. Consequently, a closed surface with Euler characteristic $-p^4$ supports no regular maps if and only if $p\\notin \\{2,3,5,7,13\\}$.",

Using these insights, this paper proposes modifications to dynamic programming algorithms that improve computational efficiency without affecting optimality. For layouts with and without a central cross-aisle, the modifications preserve linear-time complexity in the number of aisles while reducing the number of state-action evaluations per stage. The proposed modifications reduce computational effort by factors up to 1.81, confirmed by numerical experiments.

In this abstract setting, we develop a new approach to existence and multiplicity of solutions with prescribed norm in $H$. We then consider various applications of this approach. First, we obtain, under fairly general assumptions including the mass-supercritical case, the existence of infinitely many solutions to a class of nonlinear (time-independent) Schr\u00f6dinger equations on a compact graph $\\mathcal{G}$ with prescribed (arbitrarily large) mass. Moreover, we derive a similar existence and multiplicity result for a biharmonic semilinear equation in the $2$-torus. For a larger class of second order and higher order equations in a bounded domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions, we also show the existence of multiple solutions with prescribed small mass.\n  The solutions we obtain are detected as ground states of Nehari-Pankov type for the associated $\u03bb$-dependent action functional, where $\u03bb$ varies in a spectral gap between sufficiently large eigenvalues of $A$. The key observation in this abstract framework is the fact that the $H$-norms of these $\u03bb$-dependent solution families form connected sets. To estimate the size of these connected sets in specific settings, we use Weyl type estimates for the length of spectral gaps, variational characterizations of eigenvalues, bounds for associated eigenfunctions and a classical bound from analytic number theory.",

Motivated by the Physical Internet initiative, we introduce the Dynamic Stochastic Modular and Mobile Capacity Planning (DSMMCP) problem, which fosters hyperconnectivity through a network-of-networks architecture with modular and mobile capacities. The problem addresses both demand and supply uncertainties by incorporating short-term leasing of modular facilities and dynamic relocation of resources. We formulate DSMMCP as a partially adaptive multi-stage stochastic program that minimizes the expected multi-period costs under uncertainty. To tackle the inherent NP-hardness, we develop an enhanced stochastic dual dynamic integer programming (SDDiP) algorithm, which integrates strengthened cut generation, a tailored alternating cut strategy, and an efficient parallelization framework, and we establish structural dominance and monotonicity properties that formalize the value of the strengthened cuts and partial adaptivity. Numerical experiments inspired by a real case study of a large U.S. construction company demonstrate that the DSMMCP framework achieves approximately 15% cost savings over static planning while improving resilience, reducing outsourcing costs, and supporting sustainability. Complementary experiments on synthetic instances confirm the effectiveness of the proposed SDDiP algorithm in terms of solution quality and runtime, as well as the scalability and robustness of the partially adaptive stochastic modeling framework across different network sizes and uncertainty levels.",

    "title": "Adaptive Randomized Extended Bregman-Kaczmarz Method for Combined Optimization Problems",
    "abstract": "Combined optimization problems that couple data-fidelity and regularization terms arise naturally in a wide range of inverse problems. In this paper, we study an adaptive randomized averaging block extended Bregman-Kaczmarz (aRABEBK) method for solving such problems. The proposed method incorporates iteration-wise relaxation parameters that are automatically adjusted using residual information, allowing for more aggressive step sizes without additional manual tuning. We establish a convergence theory for the proposed framework and derive expected linear convergence rate guarantees. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data sets for sparse and minimum-norm least-squares problems demonstrate that our aRABEBK method achieves faster convergence and improved robustness compared with state-of-the-art extended Kaczmarz and Bregman-Kaczmarz-type algorithms, including its nonadaptive counterpart.",

    "abstract": "A main conjecture in the field of Positive Geometry states that amplituhedra are positive geometries. It is motivated by examples showing that the canonical forms of certain amplituhedra compute scattering amplitudes in particle physics. In recent work, Brown and Dupont introduced a new framework, based on mixed Hodge theory, connecting canonical forms and de Rham cohomology. In this paper, we show that this framework is consistent with the known results for amplituhedra but does not apply beyond those families. We provide an explicit example showing that the central assumption of the Brown-Dupont framework (namely to have a pair of genus zero) is not a necessary condition to be a positive geometry in the original sense of Arkani-Hamed, Bai, and Lam. This underscores the fact that our results do not immediately disqualify the amplituhedron from being a positive geometry.",

Computing the maximum weight bond is an NP-hard problem even for planar graphs. However, the problem is solvable in linear time on $(K_5 \\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, and in more general, on graphs of bounded treewidth, essentially due to clique-sum decomposition into simpler graphs.\n  We show how to obtain the bond polytope of graphs that are $1$- or $2$-sum of graphs $G_1$ and $ G_2$ from the bond polytopes of $G_1,G_2$. Using this we show that the extension complexity of the bond polytope of $(K_5 \\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs is linear. Prior to this work, a linear size description of the bond polytope was known only for $3$-connected planar $(K_5 \\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs, essentially only for wheel graphs.\n  We also describe an elementary linear time algorithm for the \\MaxBond problem on $(K_5\\setminus e)$-minor-free graphs. Prior to this work, a linear time algorithm in this setting was known. However, the hidden constant in the big-Oh notation was large because the algorithm relies on the heavy machinery of linear time algorithms for graphs of bounded treewidth, used as a black box.",

This yields closure of hereditarily symmetric names under countable tuples and, consequently, preservation of ZF; in a ZFC ground model we also obtain DC in the resulting symmetric model. When the iteration template is first-order definable over a GBC ground with Global Choice and sufficient class-recursion, the same scheme extends to class-length iterations, with the final symmetric model obtained from class hereditarily symmetric names (rather than as a union of stage models).",

    "abstract": "Composite functions have been studied for over 40 years and appear in a wide range of optimization problems. Convex analysis of these functions focuses on (i) conditions for convexity of the function based on properties of its components, (ii) formulas for the convex conjugate of the function based on those of its components and (iii) chain-rule-like formulas for the sub-differential of the function. To the best of our knowledge all existing results on this matter are based on the notion of K-convexity of functions where K is a closed convex cone. These notions can be considered elementary when K is the non-negative orthant, but otherwise may limit the accessibility of the associated results. In this work we show how standard results on perturbation function based duality can be used to recover and extend existing results without the need for K-convexity. We also provide a detailed comparison with K-convexity based results and show that, while K-convexity is not needed for the convex analysis of composite functions, it certainly aids in verifying the conditions associated with our proposed results. Finally, we provide necessary conditions for the conjugate and sub-differential formulas that are less restrictive than those required by the existing results.",

Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \\sim dm \\log_2m$ for $0 < r \\leq 1/4$ in the case of $\\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\\log m$ for all $0<r<1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $\u03a9((d-1)m \\log_2m)$ for $0 < r \\leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.",

To this end, we propose a Rician fading model where LoS components are rotated by imperfect phase estimates and attenuated by a deterministic phase-error penalty factor. We derive a linear MMSE channel estimator that captures statistical phase errors and unifies prior results, reducing to the Bayesian MMSE estimator with perfect phase knowledge and to a zero-mean model in the absence of phase knowledge. To address the non-Gaussian setting, we introduce a virtual uplink model that preserves second-order statistics of channel estimation, enabling the derivation of tractable centralized and distributed MMSE beamformers. To ensure fair assessment of the network performance, we apply these beamformers to the true uplink model and compute the spectral efficiency bounds available in the literature.

However, existing literature has mainly focused on scenarios involving either purely random or purely deterministic waveforms. This overlooks a critical reality: operational communication standards invariably utilize a hybrid structure comprising both deterministic pilots for channel estimation and random payloads for data transmission. To bridge this gap, this paper investigates the sensing mutual information (SMI) and precoding design specifically for ISAC systems employing communication signals with both pilots and data payloads. First, by utilizing random matrix theory (RMT), we derive a tractable closed-form expression for the SMI that accurately accounts for the statistical properties of the hybrid signal. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we formulate a precoding optimization problem to maximize SMI with constraints on the transmit power and communication rate, which is solved via an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers framework. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed precoding design over conventional benchmarks.",

The method constructs overlapping, localized tensor-product B-spline patches, enabling direct, meshless surface evolution from discrete samples. Within each patch, the differentiable B-spline representation yields analytic, high-order estimates of intrinsic geometric invariants, supporting curvature-driven and geometry-coupled flows. The organization of control points facilitates coherent updates of both surface samples and spline coefficients under intrinsic velocity fields. A conditioning-aware formulation of the local interpolation system, combined with a Gauss-Seidel refinement of control points, maintains interpolation quality throughout the evolution. Adaptive knot insertion and point redistribution, guided by geometric error indicators and local sampling density, preserve surface resolution and regularity during deformation. Numerical experiments demonstrate efficient and accurate reproduction of surface evolution phenomena, including mean-curvature flow, anisotropic deformations, and coupled surface-field dynamics, establishing localized B-spline methods as precise and versatile tools for dynamic manifold approximation.",

    "abstract": "A dual pre-Poisson algebra is an algebraic structure that integrates a permutative algebra and a Leibniz algebra under certain compatibility conditions. As the Koszul dual notion of the pre-Poisson algebra, this structure serves as a natural generalization of the Poisson algebra. In this paper, we commence a study on dual pre-Poisson algebras from the algebraic point of view and establish a bialgebra theory for dual pre-Poisson algebras. We begin by investigating the fundamental properties of dual pre-Poisson algebras and provide several explicit constructions. In particular, we prove that the operad of dual pre-Poisson algebras is Koszul, and we compute its Hilbert-Poincar\u00e9 series and codimension. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of diassociative formal deformations of permutative algebras and show that dual pre-Poisson algebras are the corresponding semi-classical limits. Moreover, we introduce dual pre-Poisson bialgebras, which are characterized both by Manin triples and by matched pairs of dual pre-Poisson algebras, thus developing a bialgebra theory for dual pre-Poisson algebras. Then our study leads to the permutative-Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation (PLYBE) that is composed of the permutative and the classical Leibniz Yang-Baxter equation. We conclude by introducing $\\mathcal{O}$-operators and pre-dual pre-Poisson algebras, which provide a systematic method for constructing symmetric solutions to the PLYBE and, consequently, dual pre-Poisson bialgebras.",

    "abstract": "In services such as retail audits and urban infrastructure monitoring, a platform dispatches rewarded, location-based micro-tasks to mobile workers traveling along personal origin-destination (OD) trips under hard time budgets. As requests with time constraints arrive online over a finite horizon, the platform must decide which requests to accept and how to route workers to maximize collected profit. We model this setting as the Dynamic Team Orienteering Problem in Spatial Crowdsourcing (DTOP-SC). To solve this problem, we propose a scenario-sampling rolling-horizon framework that mitigates myopic bias by augmenting each planning epoch with sampled virtual tasks. At each epoch, the augmented task set defines a deterministic static subproblem solved via an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS). We also formulate a mixed-integer programming model to provide offline reference solutions. Computational experiments are conducted on synthetic DTOP-SC instances generated from real-world road-map coordinates and on a dynamic team orienteering (DTOP) benchmark. On the map-based instances, the proposed policy exhibits stable gaps with respect to time-limited MIP solutions across the tested scales, while maintaining smooth computational scalability as the problem size increases. On the DTOP benchmark, the policy achieves an average decision time of 0.14s per instance, with 192-198s reported for multiple plan approach as an indicative reference, while maintaining competitive profit.",

    "abstract": "Dengue, which affects millions of people each year, is one of the most common diseases transmitted by infected \\textit{Aedes aegypti} mosquitoes. In the Philippines, the annual economic cost of dengue infections is estimated at around PHP 17 billion. Previous studies have shown that controlling the population of mosquitoes capable of transmitting the dengue virus can effectively reduce dengue infection rates. This study explores the use of Wolbachia as a strategy for dengue control by targeting mosquitoes. Since the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes involves substantial costs, careful planning is necessary to balance disease control with the associated economic burden. To address this, we propose a mathematical model that captures the dynamics of releasing Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes and the transmission of dengue in a population. We formulate single- and multi-objective optimization frameworks to minimize the economic costs associated with releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and the hospitalization costs resulting from dengue infections. This study aims to provide insights into the practical application of Wolbachia-based interventions for controlling dengue transmission. While the analysis is grounded in the Philippine context, the approach is general enough to be applicable to other dengue-endemic countries.",

The resulting system poses significant computational challenges due to its nonlinear and coupled structure. To achieve stable and reliable simulations of the vortex dynamics and accompanying morphological transitions, we develop a maximum bound preserving, energy-stable implicit-explicit (IMEX) scheme. The structure-preserving properties of the scheme are rigorously established, ensuring long-time stability and physical consistency. Through two- and three-dimensional simulations, the hybrid model successfully captures the temporal and spatial formation and alignment of vortices and the suppression of superconductivity under increasing magnetic fields, demonstrating both the accuracy and robustness of the proposed computational approach.",

It was previously shown that if the full Ambrosio-Tortorelli energy associated to $(u_\\varepsilon,v_\\varepsilon)$ converges to the Mumford-Shah energy of $u$, then the first inner variation converges as well. In particular, $u$ is a critical point of the Mumford-Shah functional in the sense of inner variations.

In particular, Behrend et al. obtained a quadruply refined enumeration by adding certain parameters. In this paper, we revisit the doubly refined enumeration of alternating sign matrices by adding three parameters: the number of $-1$'s, the position of the $1$ in the first row, and the position of the $1$ in the last row. Using Lascoux's formula on symmetry functions, we derive a new determinantal formula for this doubly refined enumeration.\n  Besides the enumeration conjecture, Mills et al. also proposed a decomposition conjecture, which was subsequently proven by Kuperberg.

The model is general in that the extended mixed delays of the state variable and control variable are components of all the coefficients, in particular, the diffusion term and the terminal cost. To address the difficulties induced by the extended noisy memory, by stochastic Fubini theorem, we transform the delay variational equation into a Volterra integral equation without delay, and then a kind of backward stochastic Volterra integral equation with Malliavin derivatives is introduced by the developed coefficient decomposition method and the generalized duality principle. Therefore, the stochastic maximum principle and the verification theorem are established. Subsequently, with Clark-Ocone formula, the adjoint equation is expressed as a set of anticipated backward stochastic differential equations. Finally, a nonzero-sum stochastic differential game with extended mixed delays and a linear-quadratic solvable example are discussed, as applications.",

Our investigation reveals that the Dunkl reflection parameter $\u03bc$ fundamentally alters the system's topology by breaking spatial symmetry and introducing a parity-dependent repulsive force. Numerical analysis demonstrates a monotonic increase in energy eigenvalues with increasing $\u03bc$, confirming an effective \"hard core\" behavior at the origin. The results are shown to be consistent with standard quantum mechanics in the limit $\u03bc\\to 0$. This study establishes the Dunkl formalism as a robust tool for modeling quantum systems characterized by parity-dependent exclusion effects and strong short-range correlations.",

However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound. Simulations show that the proposed algorithm can effectively improve inference accuracy by leveraging channel statistics, without end-to-end re-training.",

    "abstract": "Spectral interference, the frequency counterpart of the beating phenomenon in the time domain, can severely distort time-frequency representations (TFRs) in physical applications. We study this phenomenon for the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) with a Gaussian window and for nonlinear refinements based on the reassignment method, with an emphasis on the synchrosqueezing transform (SST). Working with a two-component harmonic model, we quantify when STFT can (and cannot) resolve two nearby frequencies: a sharp transition occurs at a critical gap that scales inversely to kernel bandwidth and depends explicitly on the amplitude ratio. Below this threshold, the spectrogram ridges undergo bifurcation and form repeating time-frequency bubbles, which we describe asymptotically and, in the balanced-amplitude case, approximate closely by ellipses. We then analyze the STFT phase, showing a canonical winding behavior, and relate the complex-valued SST reassignment map to a holomorphic structure via the Bargmann transform. In the two-component setting the reassignment rule admits an explicit Mobius-geometry description, sending frequency lines to circular arcs in the complex plane. Finally, viewing SST and reassignment through a measure mapping perspective, we derive small-kernel asymptotics that explain when reassignment sharpens energy and when it produces distorted or misleading TFRs; we also introduce a generalized synchrosqueezing framework that isolates the role of STFT weighting and clarifies how alternative choices can mitigate interference in certain regimes.",

The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11]. The correctness and invertibility of the proposed algorithm are proven analytically. Furthermore, any adversarial attempt to recover the plaintext without the private key leads to an exponential growth of the adversarial search space,even under quantum speedups. The use of continuous geometric structures,non-linear operator compositions,and enforced blockwise serialization distinguishes this approach from existing quantum-safe cryptographic proposals based on primary discrete algebraic assumptions.",

    "abstract": "We construct a Hilbert scale on $L^2([0,1])$ via a unitary twist operator that maps the standard Fourier basis to half-integer frequency exponentials. The resulting weighted spaces, equipped with norms indexed by $(1+|k+\\tfrac{1}{2}|^2)^s$, admit a canonical diagonal operator with the compact resolvent and spectrum $\\{k+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\}_{k\\in\\mathbb{Z}}$. We prove that this operator defines a Fredholm mapping between adjacent scale levels with index zero, provide an explicit solution to an antiperiodic boundary value problem illustrating the framework, and compute the zeta-regularized determinant $\\det_\u03b6(|\\widetilde{A}|) = 2$ using the Hurwitz zeta function. We establish stability under bounded perturbations and verify the well-definedness of spectral flow. The framework is developed entirely through functional-analytic methods without differential operators or boundary value problems. The construction is motivated by twisted spinor boundary conditions on non-orientable manifolds, though the present work is formulated abstractly in operator-theoretic language.",

    "abstract": "Eisenstein series play an important role in the theory of modular forms and have profound connections with $q$-series identities, partition theory, and special functions. Likewise, Ramanujan's mock theta functions, originally introduced in his last letter to Hardy, have inspired generations of mathematicians to work on $q$-series and modular forms. In this work, we establish several new identities connecting Ramanujan's continued fractions of order twenty. By employing product representation for Jacobi's theta function $\u03b8_1$, we derive a family of new relations connecting the continued fractions of order twenty with continued fractions of order ten and Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction. Further, by expressing Eisenstein series in terms of Lambert series and utilizing certain mock theta functions and their logarithmic derivatives, we obtain beautiful relations between Eisenstein series and theta functions of level twenty. Using Ramanujan's $_1 \u03c8_1$ summation formula, we establish Eisenstein series identities associated with the continued fractions of order twenty. These results extend earlier work on continued fractions of order 6, 12, and 16 and contribute to theory of $q$-series.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the rupture of invariant tubes in a class of nonautonomous dynamical systems arising from time-dependent Ermakov-type equations. Starting from an exactly tube-integrable reference system, we analyze a time-dependent invariant obtained from a positivity-preserving second-order perturbative construction, which provides a near-integrable geometric description of the dynamics. While this approximation does not preserve exact invariance, its algebraic structure remains sufficiently robust to allow a precise characterization of tube opening and loss of confinement.\n  For fixed time, the discriminant of the approximate invariant with respect to the momentum variable defines a cubic polynomial in the configuration variable. We show that the invariant tube admits an unbounded bridge if and only if the associated cubic possesses exactly one real root. This yields a purely algebraic rupture criterion based on the cubic discriminant and reduces the full geometric problem to the evaluation of a single scalar function of time.\n  Applying this criterion reveals a sequence of isolated bridge windows whose temporal organization undergoes a transition from one opening per 2*pi cycle to two openings per cycle, corresponding to a period-halving in time. These windows can be represented compactly by a one-dimensional box-plot visualization, which faithfully captures the underlying geometry and highlights the progressive densification and widening of escape-enabling intervals.\n  The results demonstrate that algebraic diagnostics derived from time-dependent invariants can retain sharp predictive power for rupture phenomena even when exact tube integrability is weakly perturbed.",

The proposed techniques focus on relaxing the traditional optimal step length associated with gradient methods, including the steepest descent (SD) and the minimal residual (MR) methods. Such a relaxation avoids the well-known negative zigzag effect and allows the iterates to move in the entire space which in turn implies that every so often the search direction approaches some eigenvector of the underlying Hessian matrix. The proposed speedups then rely on taking advantage of the properties of the Lanczos method once a search direction that approaches an eigenvector has been identified in order to accelerate the convergence towards the global minimizer. After analyzing the proposed strategies, we illustrate them on the global minimization of strictly convex functions.",

Upper and lower $p$-estimates provide a refinement of this scale, modeled by the Lorentz spaces $L_{p,\\infty}$ and $L_{p,1}$, respectively. In this article, we provide a comprehensive treatment of Banach lattices with upper $p$-estimates. In particular, we show that many well-known theorems about $p$-convex Banach lattices have analogues in the upper $p$-estimate setting, including the ability to represent all such spaces inside of infinity sums of model spaces, to canonically factor the convex operators and identify their associated operator ideals, as well as to give a precise description of the free objects and push-outs. Proving these results is far from straightforward and will require the development of a variety of new tools that avoid convexification and concavification procedures.

Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in reservoir simulation increasingly utilize hybrid approaches that couple physics-based simulators with machine-learning (ML) components. ML components offer high fidelity to training data and fast inference, enabling efficient and accurate modeling of complex multi-scale or multi-physics phenomena. Modern reservoir simulators rely on automatic differentiation (AD) to support efficient and flexible strategies for nonlinear solvers, inverse problems, and optimization problems. Efficient hybrid modeling therefore requires tight integration of the ML components with the simulator's AD framework.\n  We present the first integration of neural networks into the high-performance reservoir simulator OPM Flow. Networks are trained in TensorFlow and imported into OPM, where they are accessed as native AD functions. This presents an efficient framework for hybrid modeling and enables seamless integration in existing simulator workflows.\n  As an application, we introduce a novel, data-driven near-well model. Near-well models are essential in reservoir simulation for accurately representing singular pressure gradients around wells. Commonly used are the Peaceman near-well model and its extensions, or local grid refinement around the wells. Peaceman-type models are limited to simplified flow regimes, whereas local grid refinement is computationally expensive. We address these limitations by training a neural network to infer a Peaceman-like well index from fine-scale ensemble simulations of the near-well region. It is then integrated into OPM Flow with the new framework. Tested on relevant examples for CO$_2$ storage, the method offers high fidelity to fine-scale results at low computational cost, demonstrating the potential of the OPM Flow-Neural Network framework for hybrid modeling.",

To address this issue, we propose a novel generalized low-rank matrix approximation to represent the stochastic stiffness matrices, and approximate their inverses using the Neumann matrix series expansion. This approach transforms high-dimensional matrix inversion into a sequence of low-dimensional matrix multiplications. Therefore, the solver significantly reduces the computational cost and storage requirements while maintaining high numerical accuracy. The error analysis of the proposed solver is also provided.

    "abstract": "Many real-world dynamics exhibit chaos, a phenomenon in which neighboring trajectories in the state space of a dynamical system diverge exponentially over time. A common measure used for measuring the degree of this divergence is the Lyapunov exponent, which relies on pairwise Euclidean distances between the trajectories at each time. The main limitation of the Lyapunov exponent is its sensitivity to small perturbations in input data. Since many real-world dynamics are likely to contain some degree of inherent noise, we are motivated to construct a chaos measure that is robust to small trajectory perturbations. Persistent homology has been used for proving theoretical stability guarantees under such added noise in the data. As such, we introduce a novel, persistent homology based measure of chaos termed the persistence exponent and prove its theoretical stability. We also prove the existence of an upper bound on our measure, and show its greater experimental stability on the Lorenz and Rossler systems describing fluid convection and taffy pulling. We present an algorithm for computing the persistence exponent given a single time series with N points from a dynamical system that runs in O(N^2 log N) time. We finally show the greater experimental stability of the persistence exponent on time series data depicting a Belousov Zhabotinsky chemical reaction, which transitions from periodicity to chaos and back as the system evolves in time.",

The running time was \\[ O\\left(\\frac{D^{1/2}}{(\\log \\log D)^{1/2}} \\log^2 N \\right) \\] bit operations, asymptotically the same as the cost of computing the order of a single element using Sutherland's optimisation of the classical babystep-giantstep method. Subsequent work by several authors weakened the hypothesis $D \\geq N^{2/5}$ to $D \\geq N^{1/6}$. In this paper, we show that the hypothesis may be dropped altogether.

Boundary points move with the material to track the geometric flow, while interior points move within an ALE framework via a harmonic extension of the boundary velocity, computed by a meshless MFS with sources on a fixed auxiliary circle, thus avoiding volumetric meshing. Boundary normals and curvature are reconstructed by an adaptive local B-spline scheme that remains robust for strongly nonconvex shapes and large deformations. A posteriori error estimates are obtained from a hatmatrix formulation of leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) for both square collocation and zero-padded least-squares systems, and are complemented by maximum principle indicators for harmonic problems. Numerical experiments on circular, star-shaped, and amoeba-like domains show that square collocation suffices for moderately complex geometries, while zero-padded least-squares significantly improves interior velocity regularity and pointwise transport accuracy for strongly nonconvex shapes, without altering the source or collocation sets. The ALE-MFS algorithm also generates high-quality moving meshes for ALE-finite element methods, with larger minimum angles and slower mesh ratio growth than classical FEM mesh-motion strategies, suggesting a practical and easily integrable alternative for challenging moving-interface simulations.",

This work introduces Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), achieving exact constraint enforcement through algebraic projection in coefficient space. The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points. This eliminates penalty coefficients, dual variables, and problem-specific constructions while preserving single-shot training efficiency.

    "abstract": "Semantic communication (SC) enables bandwidth-efficient coordination in multi-agent systems by transmitting meaning rather than raw bits. However, when agents employ heterogeneous sensing modalities and AI architectures, perfect bit-level transmission no longer guarantees mutual understanding. Although deep learning methods for semantic compression have advanced, the information-theoretic limits of semantic alignment under heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Notably, semantic ambiguity shares the same mathematical structure as quantum contextuality, as both arise from cohomological obstructions, motivating a quantum formulation of SC. In this paper, an information-theoretic framework for quantum semantic communication is proposed using sheaf cohomology. Multi-agent semantic networks are modeled as quantum sheaves, where agents meaning spaces are Hilbert spaces connected by quantum channels. The first sheaf cohomology group is shown to characterize irreducible semantic ambiguity, representing a fundamental obstruction to alignment that no local processing can resolve. The minimum communication rate required for semantic alignment is proven to scale with the logarithm of the dimension of the cohomological space, establishing a semantic analog of Shannon limits. For entanglement-assisted channels, the achievable capacity is shown to strictly exceed classical bounds, with each shared ebit reducing the required classical communication by one bit, providing a rigorous interpretation of shared context. Additionally, quantum contextuality is shown to reduce cohomological obstructions, and a duality between quantum discord and integrated semantic information is established, linking quantum correlations to irreducible semantic content. This framework provides rigorous foundations for quantum-enhanced semantic communication in autonomous multi-agent systems.",

    "abstract": "The recently established spectral Favard theorem for bounded banded matrices admitting a positive bidiagonal factorization is applied to a broader class of Markov chains with bounded banded transition matrices, extending beyond the classical birth-and-death setting, to those that allow a positive stochastic bidiagonal factorization. In the finite case, the Karlin-McGregor spectral representation is derived. The recurrence of the Markov chain is established, and explicit formulas for the stationary distributions are provided in terms of orthogonal polynomials. Analogous results are obtained for the countably infinite case. In this setting, the chain is not necessarily recurrent, and its behavior is characterized in terms of the associated spectral measure. Finally, ergodicity is examined through the presence of a mass at $1$ in the spectral measure, corresponding to the eigenvalue $1$ with both right and left eigenvectors.",

WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.",

In particular, there exist such maps within the $p$-restricted region, whose weight shifts are directly related to the conjectures of Herzig on the weight part of Serre's conjecture. We explain the relation between the two operators, and we prove some properties about them, e.g., the injectivity of some of them in a generic locus of the $p$-restricted region. As an application, we produce an example of a generic entailment of Serre weights for the groups $GL_{4,\\mathbb{Q}_p}$ and $U(4)_{\\mathbb{Q}_p}$, by combining the method of arxiv:2410.09602 with our stronger results about theta operators.",

Atapour et al proved this in 2010 by showing that all but exponentially few sufficiently large 2SAPs contain a pattern that guarantees the 2SAP is non-split, provided that the requisite pattern fits in the tube. This result was recently extended to all tubes sizes that admit non-trivial links. Here we develop and apply knot theory results to answer more general questions about the entanglement complexity of 2SAPs.\n  We first extend the 1992 concept of a good measure of knot complexity to a good measure, $F$, of spanning-link complexity for $k$-component links. Using tangle products, we show, for example, that the more complex the prime knot decomposition of any component of a given link type, the greater its $F$-measure. We then prove that all but exponentially few size $m$ 2SAPs have $F$ complexity that grows at least linearly in $m$ as $m\\to \\infty$. We establish that good measures of knot complexity yield good measures of spanning-link complexity. We also establish conditions whereby more general link invariants can yield good measures. In particular, we establish that measures based on several classical invariants are good measures by our definition, eg bridge number or the number of $p$-colourings.\n  Finally, we consider how the tube dimensions affect which links are embeddable as 2SAPs as well as geometric restrictions on the entanglement complexity of the embeddings. For example, we establish that there are two-component links that occur as 2SAPs in a given tube size only when one of the components is forced into a non-minimal bridge number conformation.",

    "abstract": "This work presents the first systematic development of Stein's method for matrix distributions. We establish the basic essential ingredients of Stein's method for matrix normal approximation: we derive a generator-based Stein identity from a matrix Ornstein--Uhlenbeck diffusion with two-sided scales, provide an explicit semigroup representation for the solution of the Stein equation, and obtain regularity estimates for the solution. The new methodology is illustrated with three statistical applications, these being smooth Wasserstein distance bounds to quantify the matrix central limit theorem, a Wasserstein distance bound for the matrix normal approximation of the centered matrix $T$ distribution, and the derivation of Stein's method-of-moments estimators for scale parameters of the matrix normal distribution.",

Building on Bombieri's and Van der Poorten's explicit formula for continued-fraction coefficients of algebraic numbers (specialized to cubic roots) we derive an effective bound for a Roth-type constant assuming an effective form of ABC. Roth's original argument establishes existence but does not yield an explicit value; our approach makes the dependence on the ABC parameters explicit and also gives an explicit bound in the corresponding special case of Ridout's theorem. We then introduce the notion of approximation gain as a refinement of the quality of an abc-triple. For c in a large computational range, the approximation gain remains below a strikingly small threshold, motivating the conjecture that the approximation gain is always smaller than 1.5. This suggests a potential strategy for attacking ABC by bounding approximation gain and power gain separately.",

In particular, a transition towards that goal involves a gradual reduction of excess carbon emissions that are not essential for the well-functioning of society. In this paper we study this problem from a stochastic control perspective to identify the optimal gradual reduction of the emission rate, when an allocated excess carbon budget is used up over time. Assuming that updates of the available carbon budget follow a diffusion process, we identify the emission strategy that maximizes expected discounted emissions under the constraint of a non-increasing emission rate, with an additional term rewarding the amount of time for which the budget is not yet depleted. We establish a link of this topic to optimal dividend problems in insurance risk theory under ratcheting constraints and show that the value function is the unique viscosity solution of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We provide numerical illustrations of the resulting optimal abatement schedule of emissions and a quantitative evaluation of the effect of the non-increasing rate constraint on the value function.",

The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences.

In contrast to the extensive literature on value-based methods for MFC, policy-based approaches remain largely unexplored due to the intrinsic dependence of transition kernels and rewards on the evolving population state distribution, which prevents the direct use of likelihood-ratio estimators of policy gradients from classical single-agent reinforcement learning. We introduce a novel perturbation scheme on the state-distribution flow and prove that the gradient of the resulting perturbed value function converges to the true policy gradient as the perturbation magnitude vanishes. This construction yields a fully model-free estimator based solely on simulated trajectories and an auxiliary estimate of the sensitivity of the state distribution. Building on this framework, we develop MF-REINFORCE, a model-free policy gradient algorithm for MFC, and establish explicit quantitative bounds on its bias and mean-squared error. Numerical experiments on representative mean-field control tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels.

Our solution is potential theoretic and involves a generalisation of a notion of capacity in the work of Kahane, who solved the problem of covering compact sets in the classical setting where the random covering process is driven by the Lebesgue measure on the unit circle. One of our key innovations is a simple but powerful application of the Jankov-von Neumann uniformisation theorem, which we believe to have interest outside of this work.\n  In addition, we determine the critical exponent for the covering problem for polynomially decreasing sequences $(cn^{-t})_n$ for random covering sets driven by Borel probability measures on $\\mathbb{R}^d$. At exactly the critical exponent, the covering property generally depends on the constant $c>0$, and as an application of our main result, we determine the critical constant for random covering sets driven by natural measures on strongly separated self-conformal sets on the line.

The first of them is a significant simplification of the computations involved in obtaining the Lefschetz number of certain maps, as well as some new Lefschetz fixed-point theorems for unbounded spaces. Indeed, these ideas allow us to obtain a clear lower bound for the Nielsen number of a triad in some spaces, such as, for example, the connected sum of two p-tori (p greater than 2). Another consequence, in the case of homeomorphisms, is that, in the classical axiomatic definition of the Lefschetz number, the wedge-of-circles axiom and the cofibration axiom can be replaced by the single axiom of topological invariance of the combinatorial Lefschetz number. Using the invariance of the combinatorial Lefschetz number we also generalize O'Neill's classical result about topological invariance of the fixed-point index and we prove a topological-invariance result for the relative Lefschetz number.

For frequencies $\u03c9$ tuned to an eigenvalue of the elastic Newton (Kelvin) operator of a single inclusion, we show that as $a\\to0$ and the number of inclusions $M\\to\\infty$, the Neumann-to-Dirichlet map $\u039b_D$ converges to an effective map $\u039b_{\\mathcal{P}}$ corresponding to a background density shift $-\\mathcal{P}^2$, with the operator norm estimate $\\|\u039b_D-\u039b_{\\mathcal{P}}\\|\\le Ca^\u03b1\\mathcal{P}^6$ for some $\u03b1>0$ determined by the geometric scaling. Around this negative background we derive a first-order linearization of $\u039b_{\\mathcal{P}}$ in terms of $\u03c1$ and the Newton volume potential for the shifted Lam\u00e9 operator. Testing the linearized relation with complex geometric optics solutions yields an explicit reconstruction formula for the Fourier transform of $\u03c1$, and hence a global density recovery scheme. The results provide a metamaterial-inspired analytic framework for inverse coefficient problems in linear elasticity and a concrete paradigm for leveraging nanoscale resonators in reconstruction algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Binary linear block codes (BLBCs) form the foundation of modern communication systems, yet no single code family simultaneously optimizes all performance aspects. This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.",

The mathematical model is given by attenuated ray transforms of the fields along geodesic curves corresponding to a Riemannian metric that is defined by the index of refraction. The data are given at the boundary tangent bundle of the domain and it is well-known that they can be characterized as boundary data of a transport equation turning tensor field tomography into an inverse source problem. This way the adjoint of the forward mapping can be computed using the integral representation or, equivalently, associated to a dual transport equation. The article offers and proves two different representations for the adjoint mappings both in the dynamic and static case. The numerical implementation is demonstrated and evaluated for static fields using the damped Landweber method with Nesterov acceleration applied to both, the integral and PDE-based formulations. The transport equations are solved using a viscosity approximation. The error analysis reveals that the integral representation significantly outperforms PDE-based methods in terms of computational efficiency while achieving comparable reconstruction accuracy. The impact of noise and deviations from straight-line trajectories are investigated confirming improved accuracy if refraction is taken into account. We conclude that the inclusion of refraction to the forward model pays in spite of increased numerical cost.",

The analysis is conducted through the lens of input-to-state stability of an associated differential inclusion, which serves as the continuous-time limit of the discrete recursion. We first establish that if the limiting differential inclusion is input-to-state stable and the iterates remain almost surely bounded, then the iterates converge almost surely to the neighborhood of desired equilibrium. We then provide a verifiable sufficient condition for almost sure boundedness by assuming that the underlying operator is single-valued and globally Lipschitz. Finally, we show that several zeroth-order variants of stochastic gradient naturally fit within this framework, and we demonstrate their input-to-state stability under standard conditions. Overall, the results provide a unified theoretical foundation for studying almost sure convergence of biased stochastic approximation schemes through the Input to State stability theory of differential inclusions.",

To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.",

Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case.

    "abstract": "We present a comonadic approach to pretorsion theories on semiexact categories, i.e. categories equipped with a closed ideal of null morphisms that admits all kernels and all cokernels. We first prove that bihereditary pretorsion theories are comonadic in a 2-dimensional sense over the 2-category of semiexact categories with naturally chosen 1-cells. We then extend the built pseudo-comonad to guarantee that all pretorsion theories are pseudo-coalgebras. But interestingly, not all pseudo-coalgebras are pretorsion theories. Rather, pseudo-coalgebras give a generalized notion of pretorsion theory.",

    "title": "Statistical Robustness of Interval CVaR Based Regression Models under Perturbation and Contamination",
    "abstract": "Robustness under perturbation and contamination is a prominent issue in statistical learning. We address the robust nonlinear regression based on the so-called interval conditional value-at-risk (In-CVaR), which is introduced to enhance robustness by trimming extreme losses. While recent literature shows that the In-CVaR based statistical learning exhibits superior robustness performance than classical robust regression models, its theoretical robustness analysis for nonlinear regression remains largely unexplored. We rigorously quantify robustness under contamination, with a unified study of distributional breakdown point for a broad class of regression models, including linear, piecewise affine and neural network models with $\\ell_1$, $\\ell_2$ and Huber losses. Moreover, we analyze the qualitative robustness of the In-CVaR based estimator under perturbation. We show that under several minor assumptions, the In-CVaR based estimator is qualitatively robust in terms of the Prokhorov metric if and only if the largest portion of losses is trimmed. Overall, this study analyzes robustness properties of In-CVaR based nonlinear regression models under both perturbation and contamination, which illustrates the advantages of In-CVaR risk measure over conditional value-at-risk and expectation for robust regression in both theory and numerical experiments.",

We define representation-rate and derive limits on the reliability with which input-output information can be represented as is inherently determined by the input-source entropy. We further define representation capacity in a perturbed setting, and representation rate-distortion for a compressed output. We derive the achievable capacity, the achievable representation-rate, and their converse. Finally, we combine the results in a unified setting.",

    "title": "Controlled Interacting Branching Diffusion Processes: A Viscosity Approach",
    "abstract": "We study optimal control problems for interacting branching diffusion processes, a class of measure-valued dynamics capturing both spatial motion and branching mechanisms. From the perspective of the dynamic programming principle, we establish a rigorous connection between the control problem and an infinite system of coupled Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equations, obtained through a bijection between admissible particle configurations and the disjoint topological union of countable Euclidean spaces. Under natural coercivity conditions on the cost functionals, we show that these growth conditions transfer to the value function and yield a viscosity characterization in the class of functions satisfying the same bounds. We further prove a comparison principle, which allows us to fully characterize the control problem through the associated HJB equation. Finally, we show that the problem simplifies in the mean-field regime, where the model coefficients exhibit symmetry with respect to the indices of the individuals in the population. This permutation invariance allows us to restrict attention to a reduced class of symmetric admissible controls, a reduction established by combining the viscosity characterization of the value function with measurable selection arguments.",
