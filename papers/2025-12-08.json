    "title": "Isotropic Rank of Harmonic Polynomials",
    "abstract": "Any homogeneous harmonic polynomial can be decomposed as a sum of powers of isotropic linear forms, that is, linear forms whose coefficients are the coordinates of isotropic points. The minimum size of such decompositions for a harmonic polynomial is called its isotropic rank. As with the Waring rank, the problem of determining the isotropic rank of a given harmonic form is very hard. We determine the isotropic rank of a general harmonic form providing a full classification of the dimensions of secant varieties of the variety of d-powers of isotropic linear forms in n+1 variables, for every n,d, thus obtaining the analogue of the widely-celebrated Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem. Moreover, we completely solve the problem of determining the isotropic rank for the following classes of harmonic forms: ternary forms, quadrics and monomials.",

    "abstract": "We formulate the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Network (FHRN) as a continuous-time neural-ODE system, revealing its role as a norm-regulated reentrant dynamical process. Starting from the discrete reentry rule $x_t = x_t^{(\\mathrm{ex})} + \u03b3\\, W_r\\, g(\\|y_{t-1}\\|)\\, y_{t-1}$, we derive the coupled system $\\dot{y}=-y+f(W_ry;\\,x,\\,A)+g_{\\mathrm{h}}(y)$ showing that the network couples fast associative memory with global radial homeostasis. The dynamics admit bounded attractors governed by an energy functional, yielding a ring-like manifold. A Jacobian spectral analysis identifies a \\emph{reflective regime} in which reentry induces stable oscillatory trajectories rather than divergence or collapse. Unlike continuous-time recurrent neural networks or liquid neural networks, FHRN achieves stability through population-level gain modulation rather than fixed recurrence or neuron-local time adaptation. These results establish the reentry network as a distinct class of self-referential neural dynamics supporting recursive yet bounded computation.",

    "title": "Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Power Grid Networks using Quadratic Manifolds",
    "abstract": "The increasing size and complexity of modern power systems have led to a high-dimensional mathematical model for transient stability studies, rendering full-scale simulations computationally burdensome. While dimensionality reduction is essential for reducing this complexity, conventional approaches in power systems predominantly rely on linear projection methods. Such linear subspaces have limited capability for representing the inherently nonlinear swing dynamics of synchronous machines, often resulting in poor approximations and inefficient compression. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a quadratic manifold-based model order reduction (MOR) framework to accelerate the transient dynamic simulations in power systems. The proposed method combines the linear proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis with a learned quadratic correction term that minimizes the reconstruction error. This yields a scalable MOR strategy capable of handling strongly nonlinear behaviors, particularly those arising during fast-acting faults, where linear techniques typically fail. The method is tested on a range of benchmark power system models of increasing size and complexity. In addition, we provide a detailed numerical algorithm for constructing the quadratic manifold, along with the corresponding implementation code.",

We prove that this hierarchy precisely recovers the known Schmidt number cones for the separable case, establishing a generalized convexity characterization: $\\operatorname{MCL}_k(\\mathscr{P}_+) = \\mathcal{T}_k$.

Here we study the sum of two Green functions which can be reduced to $G_p(z):=\\frac12(G(z+p)+G(z-p))$.

In unfitted configurations, these methods impose consistent modified boundary conditions on the computational boundary. Due to the high algebraic complexity of very high order schemes, the stability is studied by visualizing the eigenspectrum of the discretized operators. A recent study on the SB method demonstrated that its Taylor expansion can be formulated as a direct polynomial correction. In this work, we prove that the ROD minimization problem admits an analogous polynomial correction. This unified perspective provides significant benefits: algorithmically, it greatly simplifies the implementation of ROD by eliminating the need for linear system inversions at each iteration; mathematically, it enables a rigorous stability study. For completeness, a side-by-side stability analysis of the ROD and SB methods is presented for polynomials up to degree 6. Furthermore, due to the stability restrictions of embedded methods for hyperbolic problems, a coupling with both explicit and implicit time integration is investigated. A set of numerical experiments confirms the findings of the stability study.",

    "abstract": "For an elliptic MEMS equation with H\u00e9non-type term, $\u0394u = \u03bb|x|^\u03b1/u^{p} + F$, we study rupture solutions, i.e. solutions for which $u(x_0)=0$ at some point $x_0$, also $x_0$ is called a rupture point. In this paper we focus on the special case where the rupture occurs at the origin. According to the different H\u00e9non-type exponents $\u03b1$, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of such solutions near the origin and derive a full asymptotic expansion of arbitrary order in a neighborhood of the origin. Moreover, for both radial solutions and non-radial solutions with asymptotic radial condition, we prove the existence of rupture solutions near the rupture point by constructing it.",

    "title": "Taylor Approximation Variance Reduction for Approximation Errors in PDE-constrained Bayesian Inverse Problems",
    "abstract": "In numerous applications, surrogate models are used as a replacement for accurate parameter-to-observable mappings when solving large-scale inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). The surrogate model may be a computationally cheaper alternative to the accurate parameter-to-observable mappings and/or may ignore additional unknowns or sources of uncertainty. The Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach provides a means to account for the induced uncertainties and approximation errors (between the accurate parameter-to-observable mapping and the surrogate). The statistics of these errors are in general unknown a priori, and are thus calculated using Monte Carlo sampling. Although the sampling is typically carried out offline the process can still represent a computational bottleneck. In this work, we develop a scalable computational approach for reducing the costs associated with the sampling stage of the BAE approach. Specifically, we consider the Taylor expansion of the accurate and surrogate forward models with respect to the uncertain parameter fields either as a control variate for variance reduction or as a means to efficiently approximate the mean and covariance of the approximation errors. We propose efficient methods for evaluating the expressions for the mean and covariance of the Taylor approximations based on linear(-ized) PDE solves. Furthermore, the proposed approach is independent of the dimension of the uncertain parameter, depending instead on the intrinsic dimension of the data, ensuring scalability to high-dimensional problems. The potential benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated for two high-dimensional inverse problems governed by PDE examples, namely for the estimation of a distributed Robin boundary coefficient in a linear diffusion problem, and for a coefficient estimation problem governed by a nonlinear diffusion problem.",

By introducing an auxiliary phase-aligned iteration and employing fixed-point convergence theory, we establish a unified local convergence framework for Riemannian gradient descent methods and derive explicit convergence rates. Specializing this framework to two metrics tailored to the energy landscape, we study the energy-adaptive and Lagrangian-based Riemannian gradient descent methods. While monotone energy decay and global convergence are established only for the former, a quantified local convergence analysis is provided for both methods. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate that the Lagrangian-based method, which incorporates second-order information on the energy functional and mass constraints, achieves faster local convergence than the energy-adaptive scheme.",

In the steady case, using an integral estimate of the curvature, we prove that the curvature operator has at most polynomial growth when the potential function is proper and the Ricci curvature has linear decay. Moreover, we also confirm that the curvature is bounded if we further assume the Ricci curvature has super-linear decay $\\BigO(r^{-1-\\varepsilon})$.

    "abstract": "Generalizing a variety of earlier problems on stable contracts in two-sided markets, Alkan and Gale introduced in 2003 a general stability model on a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ in which the vertices are interpreted as ``agents'', and the edges as possible ``contract'' between pairs of ``agents''. The edges are endowed with nonnegative capacities $b$ giving upper bounds on ``contract intensities'', and the preferencies of each ``agent'' $v\\in V$ depend on a \\emph{choice function} (CFs) that acts on the set of ``contracts'' involving $v$, obeying three well motivated axioms of \\it{consistence}, \\it{substitutability} and \\it{cardinal monotonicity}. In their model, the capacities and choice functions can take reals or discrete values and, extending well-known earlier results on particular cases, they proved that systems of \\it{stable} contracts always exist and, moreover, their set $\\cal S$ constitutes a distributive lattice under a natural comparison relation $\\prec$.\n  In this paper, we study Alkan--Gale's model when all capacities and choice functions take integer values. We characterize the set of rotations -- augmenting cycles linking neighboring stable assignments in the lattice $(\\cal S,\\prec)$, and construct a weighted poset in which the lattice the closed functions is isomorphic to $(\\cal S,\\prec)$, thus obtaining an explicit representation for the latter. We show that in general the size of the poset is at most $b^{\\rm max}|E|$, where $b^{\\rm max}$ is the maximal capacity, and the poset can be constructed in pseudo polynomial time. Then we explain that by imposing an additional condition on CFs, the size of the poset becomes polynomial in $|V|$, and the total time reduces to a polynomial in $|V|,\\log b^{\\rm max}$.",

This model is also bijectively equivalent to the Fortuin--Kasteleyn model of planar maps with parameter $q\\in (0,4)$ at its self-dual point. These have been traditionally studied using either techniques from analytic combinatorics (based in particular on the gasket decomposition of Borot, Bouttier and Guitter arXiv:1106.0153) or probabilistic arguments (based on Sheffield's hamburger-cheeseburger bijection arXiv:1108.2241). In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point. This can be thought of as the planar map analogue of Nienhuis' predictions for the critical point of the loop-$O(n)$ model on the hexagonal lattice. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for geometric features of the FK model of planar maps when $0 < q <4$, such as the exact tail behaviour of the perimeters of clusters and loops. This sharpens previous results of arXiv:1502.00450 and arXiv:1502.00546. A key step is to use the above dictionary and the probabilistic results to justify rigorously an ansatz commonly assumed in the analytic combinatorics literature.",

The proposed algorithms harness data compression and either gradient-free or stochastic gradient optimization techniques within distributed networks. The proposed framework incorporates a compression scheme with error compensation mechanisms to reduce communication overhead while maintaining convergence guarantees. Unlike traditional approaches that assume perfect communication and full gradient access, OCGT operates effectively under practical constraints by combining gradient-like tracking with one-point or stochastic gradient feedback estimation. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating dynamic regret bounds for both variants.

However, commonly used stochastic gradient-based methods often perform poorly on these parameter training problems and typically lack convergence guarantees. The stochastic reconfiguration (SR) method provides a robust preconditioner of the stochastic gradient, whose computational cost becomes prohibitive for large parameter spaces owing to the repeated inversion of large covariance matrices. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a warm-started stochastic reconfiguration (WSSR) method, which integrates warm-start techniques from singular value decomposition (SVD) to refine low-rank approximations of the preconditioning matrix iteratively. Numerical experiments on typical atomic and molecular systems highlight the effectiveness of the WSSR method within VMC calculations.",

    "abstract": "The growing integration of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced grid inertia, making modern power systems more vulnerable to instabilities. Accurate estimation of dynamic parameters such as inertia constants and damping coefficients is critical, yet traditional model-based methods struggle with scalability and adaptiveness in large, low-inertia networks. This paper presents a novel data-driven framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to estimate system parameters directly from time-series data. By reducing dimensionality before applying sparse regression, the proposed Latent-SINDy (L-SINDy) method mitigates overfitting while preserving essential system dynamics. The framework is validated on IEEE benchmark systems, including the 118-bus, 300-bus, and a large-scale 2869-bus European grid. The results demonstrate an accurate recovery of the inertia and damping values, with identified models that closely match the true dynamics of the system. The approach offers scalability, interpretability, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-time monitoring and control in renewable-rich grids.",

The construction of the present method is carried out using order conditions and error minimization subject to $A$- stability constraints. The proposed time integration schemes are $A$- and $L$-stable general linear methods (GLMs) equipped with inherent quadratic stability (IQS) criteria. We construct implicit GLMs of orders up to four with $p = q$ and $s = r$ along with the Nordsieck input vector assumption. Further, we test these schemes on three real-world problems: the van der Pol oscillator and two partial differential equations consisting of diffusion (Burgers' equation and the Gray-Scott model), and numerical results are presented. Computational results confirm that our proposed schemes are competitive with the existing GLMs and can be recognized as an alternative time integration scheme. We demonstrate the order of accuracy and convergence for the proposed schemes through observed order computation and error versus step size plots.",

    "abstract": "A graph $G = (V, E)$ is word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that, for any two distinct vertices $x, y \\in V$, $xy \\in E$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$. Two letters $x$ and $y$ are said to alternate in $w$ if, after removing all other letters from $w$, the resulting word is of the form $xyxy\\dots$ or $yxyx\\dots$ (of even or odd length). For a given set $R = \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_k\\}$ of jump elements, an undirected circulant graph $C_n(R)$ on $n$ vertices has vertex set $\\{0, 1, \\dots, n-1\\}$ and edge set $ E = \\left\\{ \\{i,j\\} \\;\\middle|\\; |i - j| \\bmod n \\in \\{r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_k\\} \\right\\}, $ where $0 < r_1 < r_2 < \\dots < r_k < \\frac{n}{2}$. Recently, Kitaev and Pyatkin proved that every 4-regular circulant graph is word-representable. Srinivasan and Hariharasubramanian further investigated circulant graphs and obtained bounds on the representation number for $k$-regular circulant graphs with $2 \\le k \\le 4$. In addition to these positive results, their work also presents examples of non-word-representable circulant graphs. In this work, we study word-representability and the representation number of 5-regular circulant graphs via techniques from elementary number theory and group theory, as well as graph coloring, graph factorization and morphisms.",

Our main objective is to investigate the exponential decay of the off-diagonal elements of the capacitance matrices associated with these waveguide systems. This decay property rigorously justifies a tight-binding approximation, which in turn enables a novel and efficient approach for computing the spectral properties of subwavelength resonators with non-compact defects.

Much is still unknown about this parameter, for instance whether it is computable. Recent work has established a dual characterization of the Shannon capacity in terms of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. A core step in this duality theory is to shift focus from Shannon capacity itself to studying the asymptotic relations between graphs, that is, the asymptotic cohomomorphisms. Towards understanding the structure of Shannon capacity, we study the \"combinatorial complexity\" of asymptotic cohomomorphism. As our main result, we prove that the asymptotic cohomomorphism order is universal for all countable preorders. That is, we prove that any countable preorder can be order-embedded into the asymptotic cohomomorphism order (i.e. appears as a suborder). Previously this was only known for (non-asymptotic) cohomomorphism. Our proof is based on techniques from asymptotic spectrum duality and convex structure of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. Our approach in fact leads to a new proof of the universality of (non-asymptotic) cohomomorphism.",

This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data. Throughout, we take an information-theoretic perspective, highlighting the role of information measures in quantifying the impact of data scarcity.",

In contradistinction, under projective determinacy (PD), we show that in all dimensions greater than one, there exist pairs of noncompact, connected manifolds whose homeomorphism groups are elementarily equivalent but which are not homeomorphic. We also show that under PD, every manifold of positive dimension admits pairs of homeomorphisms with the same type which are not conjugate to each other. Finally, we show that infinitary sentences do determine conjugacy classes of homeomorphisms and homeomorphism types of manifolds; specifically, the conjugacy class of a homeomorphism of an arbitrary manifold is determined by a single $L_{\u03c9_1\u03c9}$ sentence. Similarly, the homeomorphism type of an arbitrary connected manifold is determined by a single $L_{\u03c9_1\u03c9}$ sentence.",

Here an exhaustive analysis is carried out for D in {3,4,5,6}. For each D, all states are enumerated, their attractors and convergence distances are obtained, and the induced distribution over attractors across iterations is used to construct \"entropy funnels\". Despite the combinatorial growth of the state space, average distances remain small and entropy decays rapidly before entering a slow tail. Permutation symmetry is then exploited by grouping states into digit multisets and, in a further reduction, into low-dimensional digit-gap features. On this gap space, Kaprekar's routine induces a first-order Markov approximation whose transition structure, stationary distribution and drift fields are characterised, showing that simple gap features strongly constrain the dynamics for D=3 but lose predictive power as D increases.",

    "title": "The Multisign Algebra: A Generalization of the Sign Concept",
    "abstract": "The classical number system encodes magnitude using a single scalar value whose sign positive or negative has remained conceptually unchanged for centuries. This work introduces Multisign Algebra, a mathematical generalization of the sign concept that extends the expressive capacity of real numbers. Instead of relying on a binary sign attached to a scalar value, Multisign Algebra assigns a structured scalar for sign, encoding a richer, internally organized notion of polarity within a single numerical object. We formally define multisign numbers, their algebraic operations, and the axioms that govern them, showing that this generalization preserves essential properties of classical algebraic structures while enabling new behaviors unavailable on the standard real line. This approach extends the notion of sign beyond $\\pm$ and offers a refined way to encode polarity and directionality within algebraic systems.",

Increased platelet adhesion or protein adsorption on the device surface can induce platelet aggregation or thrombosis, which is analogous to the ``blow-up phenomenon\" in mathematical modeling. Here we mathematically analyze this stability mechanism and demonstrate that sufficiently strong flow can prevent blow-up from occurring.

We show that ecCRM retains global convergence, linear rates under mild regularity, and superlinearity for smooth manifolds. Numerical experiments on large-scale matrix completion indicate that deeper operators can dramatically reduce overall runtime, and tests on high-dimensional ellipsoids show that vanishing step sizes can yield significant acceleration, validating the practical utility of both algorithmic components of ecCRM.",

    "abstract": "Circuits are fundamental objects in linear programming and oriented matroid theory, representing the elementary difference vectors of a polyhedron between points in its affine space. A recent concept introduced by Ekbatani, Natura, and V\u00e9gh, the circuit imbalance, serves as a complexity measure relevant to iteration bounds for circuit-based augmentation and circuit diameters, as well as the general interpretability of circuits in terms of the underlying application. In this paper, we analyze linear programming formulations of relaxed combinatorial optimization problems to prove two contrasting types of results related to the circuit imbalance.\n  On one hand, we identify simple and common constraint structures, in particular arising in graph-theoretic problems, that inherently lead to an exponential circuit imbalance. These constructions show that, in quite general situations, working with the entire set of circuits poses significant challenges for an application of circuit augmentation or the study of circuit diameters.\n  On the other hand, through a case study of two classic graph-theoretic problems with exponential imbalance, the vertex graph coloring problem and the maximum weight forest problem, we exhibit the existence of sets and subsets of highly interpretable circuits of (best-case) imbalance 1. These sets correspond to the recoloring of vertices or to the addition or removal of edges, respectively, for example generalizing classic concepts of Kempe dynamics in coloring. Their interpretability in terms of the underlying application facilitates a study of circuit walks in the corresponding polytopes. We prove that a restriction of circuit walks to these sets suffices to not only guarantee reachability of the integral extreme-points of the skeleton, but leads to linear and constant circuit diameter bounds, respectively.",

T\u00f3th's problem \\cite{Toth} concerning the number of ``lonely passengers'' (those without companions) when $n$ passengers are seated independently and uniformly in $k$ initially empty buses. T\u00f3th showed that this number is stochastically non-decreasing in $k$ for fixed $n$ (see also Haslegrave's work \\cite{Haslegrave}).\n  We extend T\u00f3th's model by treating the number of buses $k$ as a time parameter. Specifically, for a fixed number of passengers $n$, the state of our Markov process at time $k \\ge 1$ is exactly T\u00f3th's configuration $(n, k)$. (We formally extend the process definition for all $t \\in [1, \\infty)$.) These processes can be coupled for all $n \\ge 1$, and this larger coupled process is what we dub the \\textbf{detachment process}.\n  Our investigation focuses on properties related to detachment, clumping, the number of lonely passengers and of non-empty buses. The central notion is \\textbf{detachment}, which occurs at time $k$ if every passenger occupies a distinct bus; we say the process is \\textbf{in a state of detachment} at $k$. A \\textbf{detachment time} $k$ is when the process transitions from a non-detached state at $k-1$ to a detached state at $k$.\n  \\textbf{Four critical time scales} are idetified -- linear, quadratic, and log-corrected linear or quadratic in the number of passengers, $n$ -- that govern the process's properties.\n  We investigate (relative) clumping. We also explore why modeling the number of passengers with a Poisson distribution simplifies the analysis of T\u00f3th's original model. To aid this derivation, we introduce a comparison theorem for binomial distributions, originally obtained by J. Najnudel \\cite{Najnudel}, along with a novel proof.",

We prove that the conformal time separation function $\u03c4_\u03a9$ (and the causal structure it induces) yields a Lorentzian pre-length structure if the original space is intrinsic and strongly causal. This allows us to construct a notion of conformal transformation between spaces within this class, yielding an equivalence relation. As applications, we show that the conformal length functional agrees with the standard conformal length of (strongly causal) spacetimes. We also prove conformal invariance of angles and causality conditions, give a characterisation of global hyperbolicity via finiteness of $\u03c4_\u03a9$ for all conformal factors, and establish the behaviour of the Lorentzian Hausdorff measure defined in [MS22a] under conformal changes. Moreover, we apply the same methods to the metric case, which is of interest in its own right. This is exemplified by proving an analog of the Nomizu--Ozeki theorem for metric length spaces, which has the advantage that the resulting complete space is conformally related to the original space.",

Such models are of relevance to heat-mass transfer phenomena, solid-fluid dynamics and the applied sciences. In particular, we derive formally effective solution representations, justifying a posteriori their validity. This includes the reconstruction of the prescribed initial and boundary data, which requires careful analysis of the various integral terms appearing in the formulae, proving that they converge in a strictly defined sense. In each IBVP, the novel formula is utilized to rigorously deduce the solution's regularity and asymptotic properties near the boundaries of the domain, including uniform convergence, eventual (long-time) periodicity under (eventually) periodic boundary conditions, and null non-controllability. Importantly, this analysis is indispensable for exploring the (non)uniqueness of the problem's solution and a new counter-example is constructed. Our work is based on the synergy between: (i) the well-known Fokas unified transform method and (ii) a new approach recently introduced for the rigorous analysis of the Fokas method and for investigating qualitative properties of linear evolution partial differential equations (PDE) on semi-infinite strips. Since only up to third-order evolution PDE have been investigated within this novel framework to date, we present our analysis and results in an illustrative manner and in order of progressively greater complexity, for the convenience of readers. The solution formulae established herein are expected to find utility in well-posedness studies for nonlinear counterparts too.",

In this paper, we introduce a regularized moment-SOS hierarchy capable of handling problems on unbounded sets or bounded sets violating the Archimedean property. Adopting a functional analysis viewpoint, we rely on the multivariate Carleman condition for measure determinacy rather than algebraic compactness. We prove that finite degree projections of the quadratic module are dense in the cone of positive polynomials with respect to the square norm induced by the measure. Based on these density results, we prove the convergence of a regularized hierarchy without invoking any Positivstellensatz. Furthermore, we propose a penalized formulation of the hierarchy which, combined with Bernstein-Markov inequalities, provides a monotonically non-decreasing sequence of certified lower bounds on the global minimum. The approach is illustrated on several benchmark problems known to be difficult or ill-posed for the standard hierarchy.",

Given $p > 1$ and an initial opinion profile $f_0: V \\to [0,1]$, at each integer step $t \\ge 1$ a uniformly random vertex $v_t \\in I$ is selected, and the opinion there is updated to the value $f_{t}(v_t)$ that minimizes the sum $\\sum_{w \\sim v_t} \\lvert f_t(v_t)-f_{t-1}(w) \\rvert^p$ over neighbours $w$ of $v_t$.\n  The case $p=2$ yields linear averaging dynamics, but for all $p \\ne 2$ the dynamics are nonlinear.\n  It is well known that almost surely, $f_t$ converges to the $p$-harmonic extension $h$ of $f_0 \\vert_{B}$. Denote the number of steps needed to obtain $\\lVert f_t - h \\rVert_{\\infty} \\le \u03b5$ by $\u03c4_p(\u03b5).$ Recently, Amir, Nazarov, and Peres~\\cite{noboundarycase} analyzed the same dynamics without boundary. For individual graphs, adding boundary values can slow down the convergence considerably; indeed, when $p = 2$ the approximation time is controlled by the hitting time of the boundary by random walk, and hitting times can be much larger than mixing times, which control the convergence when $B=\\emptyset$.\n  Nevertheless, we show that for all graphs with $n$ vertices, the mean approximation time $\\E[\u03c4_p(\u03b5)]$ is at most $n^{\u03b2_p}$ (up to logarithmic factors in $\\frac{n}\u03b5$ for $p \\in [2, \\infty)$, and polynomial factors in $\u03b5^{-1}$ for $p \\in (1, 2)$), where $\u03b2_p=\\max\\big(\\frac{2p}{p-1},3\\big)$. This matches the definition of $\u03b2_p$ given in \\cite{noboundarycase} and answers Question 6.2 in that paper.

Our view is that this should provide a relative of the Grothendieck section conjecture which may be both more accessible, and more directly applicable, than the latter.\n  As a first step in this direction, we extend aspects of the ``Weil height machine'' to the set of such augmentations, and use this to prove a Manin--Dem'janenko-style finiteness result for motivic augmentations for particular curves.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a new residual network (ResNet) block design for OFDM NeuralRx.

The algebraic background motivates generalizations of ASEP to stochastic vertex models and \"fused\" models.

While dynamic games provide a natural modeling framework, computing Nash equilibria (NEs) in large-scale settings remains challenging, and existing mean-field game approximations rely on restrictive assumptions that fail to capture collision avoidance and heterogeneous behaviors. This paper proposes an $\u03b1$-potential game framework for decentralized CAV control. We show that computing $\u03b1$-NE reduces to solving a decentralized control problem, and derive tight bounds of the parameter $\u03b1$ based on interaction intensity and asymmetry. We further develop scalable policy gradient algorithms for computing $\u03b1$-NEs using decentralized neural-network policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework accommodates diverse traffic flow models and effectively captures collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and agent heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Since the first optimality proofs for adaptive mesh refinement algorithms in the early 2000s, the theory of optimal mesh refinement for PDEs was inherently limited to stationary problems. The reason for this is that time-dependent problems usually do not exhibit the necessary coercive structure that is used in optimality proofs to show a certain quasi-orthogonality, which is crucial for the theory. Recently, by using a new equivalence between quasi-orthogonality and inf-sup stability of the underlying problem, it was shown that an adaptive Crank-Nicolson scheme for the heat equation is optimal under a severe step size restriction. In this work, we use this new approach towards quasi-orthogonality together with a Radau IIA method that combines the advantages of the Crank-Nicolson and implicit Euler schemes. We obtain the first adaptive time stepping method for non-stationary PDEs that is provably rate optimal with respect to number of time steps vs. approximation error. Together with a reduced basis method that leverages the Laplace transform for building tailored subspaces of reduced dimension, we obtain a very efficient method.",

    "abstract": "Massive MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) is a key enabler for 5G and future wireless systems, boosting channel capacity, energy efficiency, and spectral efficiency. However, high power consumption and hardware costs of Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs) in massive MIMO create practical challenges. To mitigate these, recent work proposes low-resolution DACs-restricting transmitted signals to finite voltage levels-to cut power and costs. This requires studying quantized precoding: signals are processed via a linear precoding matrix, then quantized by DACs. In this paper, we explore the linear-quantized precoding model and its statistically or asymptotically equivalent variants. We derive error bounds for two key metrics:Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) and Symbol Error Probability (SEP), based on the linear-quantized model and its equivalent counterparts. We also formulate and analyze the SINR maximization problem in both asymptotic and finite-dimensional scenarios. Our analysis shows that as system dimensions scale, finite-dimensional problem solutions/values converge to their asymptotic equivalents-underscoring the practical value of asymptotic insights with stability guarantees. These findings theoretically support robust precoding design under hardware constraints, enabling efficient massive MIMO implementation with low-resolution DACs. Beyond validating asymptotic predictions in finite regimes, our framework offers practical optimization guidelines for real-world systems, linking theory and applications.",

Starting from a smooth 2-connection $(\u03b1,\u03b2)$ on a Lie crossed module, we prove that the corresponding multiplicative integrals satisfy the axioms of a transport 2-functor, thereby providing an explicit model for nonabelian surface holonomy. This framework extends the familiar holonomy on $U(1)$-bundle gerbes to arbitrary gauge 2-bundles whilst avoiding abstract categorical machinery. The resulting three-dimensional Stokes theorem yields the Wess-Zumino phase law and gives an analytic counterpart of the boundary phase relation underlying the Chern-Simons functional.",

The method enforces the divergence-free constraint implicitly, removing velocity--pressure compatibility conditions and eliminating pressure boundary layers. Consistent boundary conditions are imposed, also for settings with open and traction boundaries. Hence, accuracy in time is no longer limited by a splitting error.\n  The symmetric interior penalty Galerkin method is used for second spatial derivatives. The convective term is treated in a semi-implicit manner, which relaxes the CFL restriction of explicit schemes while avoiding the need to solve nonlinear systems required by fully implicit formulations. For improved mass conservation, Leray projection is combined with divergence and normal continuity penalty terms.\n  By selecting appropriate fluxes for both the divergence of the velocity field and the divergence of the convective operator, the consistent pressure boundary condition can be shown to reduce to contributions arising solely from the acceleration and the viscous term for the $L^2$ discretization. Per time step, the decoupled nature of the scheme with respect to the velocity and pressure fields leads to a single pressure Poisson equation followed by a single vector-valued convection-diffusion-reaction equation. We verify optimal convergence rates of the method in both space and time and demonstrate compatibility with higher-order time integration schemes. A series of numerical experiments, including the two-dimensional flow around a cylinder benchmark and the three-dimensional Taylor--Green vortex problem, verify the applicability to practically relevant flow problems.",

These methods iteratively construct and solve quadratic programming (QP) subproblems to compute directions that converge to a local minimum. While numerous open-source and commercial SQP algorithms are available, their implementations lack the transparency and modularity necessary to adapt and fine-tune them for specific applications or to swap out different modules to create a new optimizer. To address this gap, we present OpenSQP, a modular and reconfigurable SQP algorithm implemented in Python that achieves robust performance comparable to leading algorithms. We implement OpenSQP in a manner that allows users to easily modify or replace components such as merit functions, line search procedures, Hessian approximations, and QP solvers. This flexibility enables the creation of tailored variants of the algorithm for specific needs. To demonstrate reliability, we present numerical results using the standard configuration of OpenSQP that employs a smooth augmented Lagrangian merit function for the line search and a quasi-Newton BFGS method for approximating the Hessians. We benchmark this configuration on a comprehensive set of problems from the CUTEst test suite. The results demonstrate performance that is competitive with proven nonlinear optimization algorithms such as SLSQP, SNOPT, and IPOPT.",

Specifically, we consider the high-order spectra defined via the $k$-adjacency tensor. Within this framework, we prove that a graph admits a non-empty $k$-core if and only if the spectral radius of the $k$-adjacency tensor is greater than or equal to $1$. Moreover, when the $k$-core exists, vertices corresponding to positive entries in the Perron vector of the $k$-adjacency tensor belong to the $k$-core. We thus define the $k$-order eigenvector centrality via the Perron vector, which provides both membership identification and a measure of relative influence within the $k$-core. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and illustrate the properties of this centrality measure in some real-world networks.",

Since the concept was introduced by Gale in 1954, several increasingly strong criteria have been developed to characterize indecomposability. Our first contribution is a new indecomposability criterion that unifies and generalizes most of the previous techniques. The key new ingredient of our method is the introduction of the graph of (implicit) edge dependencies, which has broader applications in the study of deformation cones of polytopes, beyond indecomposability. One of our main applications is providing new indecomposable deformed permutahedra that are not matroid polytopes. In 1970, Edmonds posed the problem of characterizing the extreme rays of the submodular cone, that is, indecomposable deformed permutahedra. Matroid polytopes from connected matroids give one such family of polytopes. We provide a new infinite disjoint family by taking certain graphical zonotopes and deeply truncating 1 or 2 specific vertices. In this way, we construct $2 \\lfloor\\frac{n-1}{2}\\rfloor$ new indecomposable deformations of the $n$-permutahedron in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We also showcase other applications of our tools. For example, we use them to refute a conjecture by Smilansky (1987) stating that an indecomposable polytope needs to have few vertices with respect to its number of facets. We provide bounds on the dimension of deformation cones and characterize certain of their rays, we introduce parallelogramic Minkowski sums whose deformation cone can be written as a product of deformation cones, and we construct indecomposable polytopes via truncations and stackings.",

While convergence of entropic minimizers is well understood in the discrete setting and in the case where the cost is continuous and there is a unique optimal transport plan, the question of existence and characterization outside these settings remains largely open. We propose a natural candidate for the limiting object and establish its convergence under mutual singularity of the marginals. For arbitrary marginals, we moreover prove that every limit point of entropic minimizers obeys a structural condition known as weak multiplicativity. The construction of our candidate relies on a decomposition theorem for optimal transport plan that we believe is of independent interest.

The energies under consideration consist of a non-convex bulk term and a higher-order regularizing term and are subject to incompatible boundary conditions. In contrast to existing results in the literature, in this work, admissible fields are not necessarily gradient fields, instead their curl is linked to topological singularities, so-called vortices, in the discrete $J_1$-$J_3$-model. The main result of this work is a scaling law for the minimal energy with respect to three parameters: one measuring the incompatibility of the boundary conditions, the second measuring the strength of the regularizing term, and the third being related to the interatomic distance in the discrete model. The shown result implies in particular that in certain parameter regimes, minimizers necessarily develop vortices. A key tool in the analysis is a careful modification of the celebrated ball-construction technique that, due to a lack of rigidity, considers simultaneously both the bulk energy and the regularizing term.",

    "abstract": "Simulating complex diffusion-reaction systems is often prohibitively expensive due to the high dimensionality and stiffness of the underlying ODEs, where state variables may span tens of orders of magnitude. Deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool in scientific computing, achieving remarkable progress in modeling and sampling stiff systems. However, data scaling techniques remain largely underexplored, despite their crucial role in addressing the frequency bias of deep neural networks when handling multi-magnitude or high-frequency data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Box-Cox Transformation (GBCT), a novel nonlinear scaling method designed to mitigate multiscale challenges by rescaling inherent multi-magnitude components toward a more consistent order of magnitude. We integrate GBCT into our previous data-driven framework and evaluate its performance against the original baseline surrogate model across six representative scenarios: a 21-species chemical reaction kinetics, a 13-isotope nuclear reaction model, the well-known Robertson problem coupled with diffusion, and practically relevant simulations of two-dimensional turbulent reaction-diffusion systems as well as one- and two-dimensional nuclear reactive flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that GBCT reduces prediction errors by up to two orders of magnitude compared with the baseline model - particularly in the long-term evolution of dynamical systems - and achieves comparable performance with only about one-sixth of the training epochs. Frequency analysis further reveals that GBCT rescales high-frequency components of the objective function toward lower frequencies to align with the neural network's natural low frequency bias, thereby boosting training and generalization. The source code to reproduce the results in this paper is available at https://github.com/Seauagain/GBCT.",

The uniform-in-time boundedness of the numerical solution is rigorously proven in the discrete $H^1$ and $H^2$ norms under a mild time-step condition, and an $\\ell^\\infty$ bound is derived via a discrete Sobolev embedding. These results remove the typical boundedness assumption required in previous energy-stability analyses, thereby establishing unconditional energy dissipation for the fully discrete scheme. Building on this uniform boundedness, we derive an optimal-order error estimate in the $\\ell^2$ norm.
