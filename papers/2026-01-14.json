    "abstract": "Rooted binary phylogenetic networks are extensions of rooted binary trees, adding reticulation nodes that are designed to represent evolutionary processes that involve hybridization events. Enumerative combinatorics studies have counted leaf-labeled phylogenetic networks in a variety of classes, finding that when the number of reticulations is fixed, the time-consistent galled trees are asymptotically less numerous than each of several network classes that had been previously examined. Here we provide enumerative results on two additional network classes: general galled trees and simplex time-consistent galled trees. We show that for a fixed number of galls, as the number of leaves goes to infinity, the asymptotic count of general galled trees is identical to that of time-consistent galled trees, whereas the count of simplex time-consistent galled trees is smaller. If the number of galls is not restricted, then the asymptotic approximations all differ: simplex time-consistent galled trees are less numerous than time-consistent galled trees, which are in turn less numerous than general galled trees. We also report a variety of additional results: recursions to count the studied networks with small numbers of leaves a fixed number of galls, as well as enumerative results for unlabeled networks in the classes that we investigate.",

    "abstract": "The conjugator length function of a finitely generated group is the function $f$ so that $f(n)$ is the minimal upper bound on the length of a word realizing the conjugacy of two words of length at most $n$. We study herein the spectrum of functions which can be realized as the conjugator length function of a finitely presented group, showing that it contains every function that can be realized as the Dehn function of a finitely presented group. In particular, given a real number $\u03b1\\geq2$ which is computable in double-exponential time, we show there exists a finitely presented group whose conjugator length function is asymptotically equivalent to $n^\u03b1$. This yields a substantial refinement to results of Bridson and Riley. We attain this result through the computational model of $S$-machines, achieving the more general result that any sufficiently large function which can be realized as the time function of an $S$-machine can also be realized as the conjugator length function of a finitely presented group. Finally, we use the constructed groups to explore the relationship between the conjugator length function, the Dehn function, and the annular Dehn function in finitely presented groups.",

    "abstract": "Let $k\\ge 2$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a simple graph of order $n$ with minimum degree $\u03b4$. A graph $G$ is said to have property $P(k, d)$ if it contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees and an additional forest $F$ with edge number $|E(F)| > \\frac{d-1}{d}(n-1)$, such that if $F$ is not a spanning tree, then $F$ has a component with at least $d$ edges. Let $D(G)$ be the distance matrix of $G$. We denote $\u03c1_D(G)$ as the largest eigenvalue of $D(G)$, which is called the distance spectral radius of $G$. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the distance spectral radius and the property $P(k, \u03b4)$. We prove that for a connected graph $G$ of order $n \\ge 2k+8$ with minimum degree $\u03b4\\ge k+2$, if $\u03c1_D(G) \\le \u03c1_D(K_{k-1} \\vee (K_{n-k} \\cup K_1))$, then $G$ possesses property $P(k, \u03b4)$.

Under the assumptions of locality, Lorentz invariance, and validity of the effective field theory expansion below a fixed cutoff, we show that quantum corrections do not generate local operators that renormalize the classical derivative self-interactions responsible for the constraint structure of the theory. The proof combines an operator-level analysis of the space of allowed local counterterms with a systematic decoupling-limit argument, which isolates the leading contributions to the effective action at each order in the derivative expansion. As a consequence, all radiatively induced local functionals necessarily involve additional derivatives per field and are suppressed by the intrinsic strong-coupling scales of the theory. In particular, the classical interactions defining ghost-free vector field theories are stable under renormalization, and any additional degrees of freedom arising from quantum corrections appear only above the effective field theory cutoff. This result extends known non-renormalization properties of flat-space vector theories to the case of dynamical geometry and provides a structural explanation for their perturbative stability to all loop orders.",

In this setting, we derive an explicit formula for the Kantorovich potential in terms of the imbalanced cumulative mass (a generalization of the cumulative distribution in R) along an optimal spanning tree solving such a minimization problem, under a weak non-degeneracy condition on the pair of measures that guarantees the uniqueness of a dual potential. Our second contribution establishes the existence of an optimal transport plan that can be computed efficiently by a dynamic programming procedure once an optimal spanning tree is known. Finally, we propose a stochastic algorithm based on simulated annealing on the space of spanning trees to compute such an optimal spanning tree. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical relevance of the proposed approach for optimal transport on finite metric spaces.",

    "abstract": "Current cellular systems achieve high spectral efficiency through Massive MIMO, which leverages an abundance of antennas to create favorable propagation conditions for multiuser spatial multiplexing. Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems.",

Under an assumption of convergence of resolvent approximations in the operator norm and an assumption on global reliability of source problem error estimators, we show that the gap in eigenspace approximations can be bounded by a globally reliable and computable error estimator. Also included are applications of the theoretical framework to first-order system least squares (FOSLS) discretizations and discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) discretizations, both yielding new estimators for the error gap. Numerical experiments with a selfadjoint model problem and with a leaky nonselfadjoint waveguide eigenproblem show that adaptive algorithms using the new estimators give refinement patterns that target the cluster as a whole instead of individual eigenfunctions.",

It belongs to the broader class of anisotropic-diffusion-advection equations, whose numerical approximation is highly-nontrivial due to its nonlinearity, stiffness, and structural properties such as conservation and entropy dissipation (hence with the Maxwellian distribution as the equilibrium state). In this paper, we propose a structure-preserving penalization scheme for the stiff, single-species RFP equation. The scheme features three novel components: 1) a novel generalization of the well-known Chang-Cooper discretization for the RFP equation that is equilibrium-preserving and enables positivity while preserving mass, momentum, and energy; 2) an easy-to-invert isotropic variable-coefficient penalization operator to deal with the temporal stiffness without resorting to a fully implicit scheme, borrowing ideas from explicit-implicit-null (EIN) methods, and 3) an adaptive timestepping strategy that preserves the positivity of the full penalized scheme. The resulting scheme conserves mass, momentum, and energy strictly, is unconditionally stable, and robustly positivity preserving. The scheme is demonstrated with linear and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion examples of increasing complexity, including several single-species RFP examples.",

In this setting, strands are arranged in an array and synthesized according to a fixed global synthesis sequence, with the restriction that at most one strand per row may be synthesized in any synthesis cycle. We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3. Finally, we present a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal offline schedule for any fixed pair of sequences. Together, these results provide the first analytical bounds for synthesis under spatial constraints and lay the groundwork for future studies of optimal synthesis policies in such settings.",

In histopolation, the available input data does not consist of pointwise function samples but of averages taken over intervals or higher-dimensional regions, and these mean values serve as a basis for reconstructing or approximating the target function. While classical interpolation requires continuity of the underlying function, histopolation can be performed in larger function spaces. In the framework of kernel methods, we will introduce and study the so-called averaging kernel Hilbert spaces (AKHS's) for this purpose. Within this setting, we develop systematic construction principles for averaging kernels and provide characterizations based on the Fourier-Plancherel transform. In addition, we analyze several representative histopolation scenarios in order to highlight properties of this approximation method, including conditions for unisolvence and possible error estimates. Finally, we present numerical experiments that shed some light on the convergence behavior of the presented approach and demonstrate its practical effectiveness.",

On the polyhedral side, in the discrete real setting the Isbell inequalities cut out a canonical polyhedral decomposition of $pnuc(M)$ recovering the usual tropical cell structure.

    "title": "An efficient mixed-integer linear programming formulation for solving influence diagrams",
    "abstract": "Influence diagrams represent decision-making problems with interdependencies between random events, decisions, and consequences. Traditionally, they have been solved using algorithms that determine the expected utility-maximizing decision strategy. In contrast, state-of-the-art solution approaches convert influence diagrams into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, which can be solved with powerful off-the-shelf MILP solvers. From a computational standpoint, the existing MILP formulations can be efficiently solved when applied to influence diagrams that represent periodic (or sequential) decision processes, which can be cast as partially observable Markov Decision Processes. However, they are inefficient in problems that lack a periodic structure or if the nodes in the influence diagram have large state spaces, thus limiting their practical use. In this paper, we present an efficient MILP formulation that is specifically designed for influence diagrams that are challenging for the earlier MILP formulation-based methods. Additionally, we present how the proposed formulation can be adapted to maximize conditional value-at-risk and how chance and logical constraints can be incorporated into the formulation, thus retaining the modeling flexibility of the MILP-based methods. Finally, we perform computational experiments addressing problems from the literature and compare the computational efficiency of the proposed formulation against the available MILP formulations for the reported influence diagrams. We find that the MILP models based on the proposed formulations can be solved significantly more efficiently compared to the state-of-the-art when solving influence diagrams that cannot be cast as partially observable Markov decision processes.",

Various useful properties of octonionic relative extremal functions and octonionic capacity are established. The main difficulty is the non-associativity of octonions. However, some weak form of associativity can be used to covercome this difficulty. Another important ingredient in pluripotential theory is the solution to the Dirichlet problem for the homogeneous octonionic Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation on the unit ball, for which we show the $C_{loc}^{1,1}$-regularity by applying Bedford-Taylor's method. The obstacle to do so is that an OPSH function is usually not OPSH under automorphisms of the unit ball. This issue can be solved by finding a weighted transformation formula of OPSH functions.",

    "abstract": "Maximal quantum $f$-divergences - defined via the commutant Radon-Nikodym derivative provide a fundamental measure of distinguishability between quantum states in the operator convex setting. In this work, we determine the exact extremal values of these divergences over the unitary orbits of two quantum states. Using the integral representation of operator convex functions, majorization theory, Lidskii-type inequalities, and structural properties of Kubo-Ando means, we derive fully explicit spectral formulas for \\[ \\min_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(\u03c1\\|U^{*}\u03c3U) \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\max_{U\\in \\mathbb U_n} \\tilde S_f(\u03c1\\|U^{*}\u03c3U), \\] and identify the unitaries achieving these extrema. We show that the optimization reduces to spectral rearrangement: the minimum occurs when the decreasing eigenvalues of $\u03c1$ and $\u03c3$ are paired, while the maximum corresponds to pairing the decreasing eigenvalues of $\u03c1$ with the increasing spectrum of $\u03c3$. Consequently, the full range of the divergence along the unitary orbit is exactly the closed interval between these two endpoints. We further compare our results with the recent unitary optimization framework for hockey-stick-based quantum $f$-divergences of Li and Yan (2025), highlighting fundamental structural differences between the two families. Our findings extend prior extremal analyses for Umegaki, R\u00e9nyi, and Hellinger-type divergences, and illuminate the distinct noncommutative nature of maximal quantum $f$-divergences.",

    "abstract": "We consider time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by a cluster of hybrid dielectric-plasmonic dimers in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. Each dimer consists of a high-contrast dielectric nanoparticle and a moderately contrasting plasmonic nanoparticle separated by a subwavelength distance. The cluster is assumed to contain many such dimers whose size $a$ is small compared to the wavelength, with intra-dimer and inter-dimer distances scaling like $a^{t_1}$ and $a^{t_2}$, and the frequency is tuned near suitable electric and magnetic resonances of the associated Newtonian and magnetization operators on the reference shapes.\n  Under these geometric, contrast and spectral assumptions, we derive a Foldy--Lax type approximation for the Maxwell system. We show that the scattered field and its far field admit asymptotic expansions in terms of four moments attached to each dimer, which solve an explicit finite-dimensional linear system. We prove invertibility of this system under quantitative smallness conditions on the contrast and the dimer density, and we obtain error estimates uniform in the number of dimers.\n  By extracting the dominant components, we further show that each hybrid dimer behaves, at leading order, as a co-located electric and magnetic dipole driven by the local fields, and we identify the corresponding $6\\times 6$ polarizability matrix. This provides a discrete model for clusters of hybrid dimers that is suitable for fast forward simulations, inverse schemes, and as input for effective-medium descriptions. In particular, it suggests parameter regimes where clusters of hybrid dimers can generate (double) negative effective permittivity and permeability and bi-anisotropic constitutive laws and eventually hyperbolic media.",

We analyze an $S^1$-invariant Morse-Bott function on the minimal resolution, interpreting its gradient flow lines as $1$-parameter families of holonomy representations of flat connections from $\u0393$ to $GL(R)$. We conjecture that the flow emanating from a critical submanifold converges asymptotically at the boundary to a specific irreducible representation of $\u0393$.

To enforce the Stiefel manifold constraint without introducing the analytical complications of retraction-based updates, we design a fully discrete retraction-free orthonormality-preserving scheme for spatiotemporal HiSD. This scheme exhibits favorable structural properties that substantially reduce the difficulties arising from coupling and gradient nonlinearities in spatiotemporal HiSD. Exploiting these properties, we establish gradient stability and error estimates, which consequently ensure the preservation of the Morse index for the computed saddle points. The framework is further extended to the semilinear advection-reaction-diffusion equation. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in finding multiple solutions and constructing the solution landscape of semilinear elliptic problems. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first rigorous full space--time accuracy analysis of the HiSD system. It reveals intrinsic connections between saddle-search algorithms and numerical methods for PDEs, enhancing their mutual compatibility for a broad range of problems.",

We introduce a novel regularization scheme based on a weighted pressure perturbation of the form $\\tilde{P}(\u03c1,\u03b4) = \\int_\u03b4^\u03c1s^{-2}(s^2P'(s) - \u03b4^2 P'(\u03b4)) \\, ds$. Unlike previous methods that modify the continuity equation, our approach strictly preserves mass conservation while creating a degenerate hyperbolic boundary at the cut-off density $\u03c1=\u03b4$. We provide a rigorous derivation of the eigenstructure and Riemann invariants for the perturbed system. A key theoretical contribution is the proof that the perturbed pressure exactly inherits the convexity properties of the original state equation ($2\\tilde{P}'+\u03c1\\tilde{P}'' = 2P'+\u03c1P''$), thereby ensuring the strict convexity of the mechanical energy entropy without additional assumptions.

This correspondence has been fruitful in uncovering lattice structures in the triangulations. We start by showing that this correspondence is actually a linear isomorphism. We then consider flow cones of certain graphs with cycles. For this case, we give a DKK-like triangulation of the cone, and extend the correspondence to the finite $g$-vector fan of a corresponding locally gentle quiver. In addition, we extend to cyclic graphs a mysterious result of Postnikov--Stanley and Baldoni--Vergne, giving the volume of flow polytopes of acyclic graphs as the number of certain integer flows on the same graph.\n  We illustrate our results with a two-parameter family of cyclic graphs that includes a cycle graph and nested 2-cycles as special cases.

We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a shadowable point to be an upper (resp. a lower) semicontinuity point of $\u03c9$-limit sets. Assuming global shadowing, we show that the lower semicontinuity of $\u03c9$-limit sets is equivalent to the chain continuity. We also show that the lower semicontinuity of $\u03c9$-limit sets is equivalent to the chain continuity in a general setting. Several examples are given to illustrate the results.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to sample random sparse matrices to be used as check matrices for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\\mathbf H\\in\\mathbb F_2^{r\\times n}$ such that $\\mathbf H\\mathbf H^\\top = \\mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.\n  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.\n  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a stratification framework for nonlinear semidefinite programming (NLSDP) that reveals and utilizes the geometry behind the nonsmooth KKT system. Based on the \\emph{index stratification} of $\\mathbb{S}^n$ and its lift to the primal--dual space, a stratified variational analysis is developed. Specifically, we define the stratum-restricted regularity property, characterize it by the verifiable weak second order condition (W-SOC) and weak strict Robinson constraint qualification (W-SRCQ), and interpret the W-SRCQ geometrically via transversality, which provides its genericity over ambient space and stability along strata. The interactions of these properties across neighboring strata are further examined, leading to the conclusion that classical strong-form regularity conditions correspond to the local uniform validity of stratum-restricted counterparts. On the algorithmic side, a stratified Gauss--Newton method with normal steps and a correction mechanism is proposed for globally solving the KKT equation through a least-squares merit function. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges globally to directional stationary points. Moreover, under the W-SOC and the strict Robinson constraint qualification (SRCQ), it achieves local quadratic convergence to KKT pairs and eventually identifies the active stratum.",

The $w$-product outperforms existing tensor multiplication approaches by enabling fast and numerically stable tensor decompositions by proposing ``$w$-svd'' and its sparse variant ``sp-$w$-svd'', for efficient low-rank approximations with significantly reduced computational costs. Experiments on low-rank hyperspectral image reconstruction demonstrate up to a $92.21$ times speedup compared to state-of-the-art ``$t$-svd'', with comparable PSNR and SSIM metrics. We discuss the Moore-Penrose inverse of tensors based on the $w$-product and examine its essential properties. Numerical examples are provided to support the theoretical results. Then, hyperspectral image deblurring experiments demonstrate up to $27.88$ times speedup with improved image quality. In particular, the $w$-product and the sp-$w$-product exhibit exponentially increasing acceleration with the decomposition level compared to the traditional approach of the $t$-product.

    "title": "Distributed Detection under Stringent Resource Constraints",
    "abstract": "This paper identifies the Stein-exponent of distributed detection when the sensor communicates to the decision center over a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) subject to one of three stringent communication constraints: 1) The number of channel uses of the DMC grows sublinearly in the number of source observations n; 2) The number of channel uses is n but a block-input cost constraint is imposed almost surely, which grows sublinearly in n; 3) The block-input constraint is imposed only on expectation. We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.\n  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.\n  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses. To prove these results, we propose both new coding strategies and new converse proofs.",

Writing $Q_{p,q}(t)$ as a quintic in $t^{2}$ produces an associated monic quintic polynomial. After the weighted normalization $r=p/q$ and $s=r^{2}$ we obtain a one-parameter family $P_s(x)\\in\\mathbb{Q}[x]$ such that \\[ Q_{p,q}(t)=q^{20}\\,P_s\\!\\left(\\frac{t^{2}}{q^{4}}\\right)\\qquad\\text{with}\\qquad s=\\left(\\frac{p}{q}\\right)^{2}. \\] Assuming a quadratic divisor $x^{2}+ax+b$ with $a,b\\in\\mathbb{Q}$, we reduce divisibility of $P_s(x)$ to the vanishing of an explicit remainder \\[ R(x)=R_{1}(s,a,b)\\,x+R_{0}(s,a,b). \\] A key structural observation is that $R_1$ and $R_0$ are quadratic in $b$ and that, on the equation $R_1=0$, the second condition becomes linear in $b$. This yields a one-direction elimination to a plane obstruction curve $F(s,a)=0$ with $F\\in\\mathbb{Z}[s,a]$, without any lifting-back issues: when the linear coefficient is nonzero, the parameter $b$ is forced to be the rational value $b=C/L$.

Solving the GPE on a single mesh, even with adaptive refinement, can lead to excessive computational costs due to the need to accommodate the most oscillatory solution. To address this issue, we present a multi-mesh adaptive finite element method for solving the GPE. To this end, we first convert it into a time-dependent equation through the imaginary time propagation method. Then the equation is discretized by the backward Euler method temporally and the multi-mesh adaptive finite element method spatially. The proposed method is compared with the single-mesh adaptive method through a series of numerical experiments, which demonstrate that the multi-mesh adaptive method can achieve the same numerical accuracy with less computational consumption.",

In three-dimensional domains periodic in a spanwise direction $z$, $z$-dependence of $\u03bc^*$ converts coefficient multiplication into convolution in spanwise Fourier index, yielding an operator-valued Toeplitz/Laurent coupling of modes. Consequently, even spanwise-uniform forcing generically produces $\u03ba\\neq 0$ sidebands in the harmonic response as a \\emph{linear, constitutive} effect.\n  We place $\u03bc^*$ at the closure level $\\hat{\\boldsymbol\u03c4}=2\\,\u03bc^*(\\mathbf{x},\u03c9)\\mathbf{D}(\\hat{\\mathbf{v}})$, as the boundary value of the Laplace transform of a causal stress-memory kernel.

    "title": "Robustness of the 2-Choices Dynamics to Node Failures",
    "abstract": "In many applications, it becomes necessary for a set of distributed network nodes to agree on a common value or opinion as quickly as possible and with minimal communication overhead. The classical 2-choices rule is a well-known distributed algorithm designed to achieve this goal. Under this rule, each node in a network updates its opinion at random instants by sampling two neighbours uniformly at random and then adopting the common opinion held by these neighbours if they agree. For a sufficiently well-connected network of $n$ nodes and two initial opinions, this simple rule results in the network being absorbed in a consensus state in $O(\\log n)$ time (with high probability) and the consensus is obtained on the opinion held by the majority of nodes initially.\n  In this paper, we study the robustness of this algorithm to node failures. In particular, we assume that with a constant probability $\u03b1$, a node may fail to update according to the 2-choices rule and erroneously adopt any one of the two opinions uniformly at random. This is a strong form of failure under which the network can no longer be absorbed in a consensus state. However, we show that as long as the error probability $\u03b1$ is less than a threshold value, the network is able to retain the majority support of the initially prevailing opinion for an exponentially long time ($\u03a9(\\poly(\\exp(n)))$). In contrast, when the error probability is above a threshold value, we show that any opinion quickly ($O(\\log n)$ time) loses its majority support and the network reaches a state where (nearly) an equal proportion of nodes support each opinion. We establish the above phase transition in the dynamics for both complete graphs and expander graphs with sufficiently large spectral gaps and sufficiently homogeneous degrees. Our analysis combines spectral graph theory with Markov chain mixing and hitting time analyses.",

Oblique dual frames generalize this phenomenon. In this paper, we provide new tools to study oblique dual frames and introduce a probabilistic variant of oblique dual frames. We first present the oblique dual frame potential and show that it is minimized precisely when the oblique dual coincides with the canonical oblique dual. We then define oblique dual probabilistic frames and oblique approximately dual probabilistic frames. In particular, we prove that for a given oblique dual probabilistic frame, the associated oblique dual probabilistic frame potential is minimized if and only if the frame is tight and the oblique dual is canonical. Moreover, the tightness assumption can be removed when the minimization is restricted to oblique dual probabilistic frames of pushforward type. Finally, we investigate perturbations of oblique dual probabilistic frames and show that if a probability measure is sufficiently close to an oblique dual probabilistic frame pair in the $2$-Wasserstein topology, then it forms an oblique approximately dual probabilistic frame.",

    "title": "The many faces of multivariate information",
    "abstract": "Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data has become an area of intensive study in complex systems science, as these multipartite interactions can reveal insights into fundamental features of complex systems like emergent phenomena. Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes\" and ``parts\" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order\" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $\u0394^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $\u0394^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $\u0394^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $\u0394^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $\u0394^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $\u0394^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $\u0394^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $\u0394^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $\u0394^{k}$, which we term $\u0393^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure.",

    "abstract": "The main contribution of this paper is the proof of the generic finiteness of Dziobek central configurations for a homogeneous potential and the derivation of a uniform upper bound for their number. By exploiting the isomorphism between the Veronese variety and the determinantal variety associated with the Dziobek conditions, we define the Dziobek-Veronese variety and apply the dimension of fibers theorem to analyze the projection from the space of configurations and masses to the space of masses. We prove that the fibers of this projection, representing the central configurations for a given mass vector, are finite for masses chosen outside a proper algebraic subvariety. Furthermore, we utilize that the Dziobek variety is defined by an intersection of quadrics to obtain a bound of Bezout type for the number of Dziobek configurations with fixed masses given by a power of $2$ with exponent quadratic in $n$. Unlike previous estimates tailored to specific potentials, this bound depends solely on the dimension $n$. For instance, for the four-body problem, our bound reduces to $8192$, which is lower than the bound of $8472$ established by Moeckel and Hampton. This suggests that the complexity of counting Dziobek configurations for generic masses is governed primarily by the ambient geometry of the configuration space, rather than by the non-linearity of the interaction potential.",

It is therefore not possible to use a line-search method based on the value of the objective function; instead, the line search can operate on merit functions. In this report, we explore an alternative line-search method which is applicable to this case; it particulary addresses the damping of the step length in tight valleys. We propose a line-search criterion based on the divergence of the field of Newton step vectors. The visualization of the criterion for two-dimensional test functions reveals a network of ravines with flat bottom at the zero points of the criterion. The ravines are typically connected to stationary points. To traverse this ravine network in order to approach a stationary point, a zigzag strategy is devised. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the novel line-search strategy succeeds from most starting points in all test functions, but only exhibits the desired damping of the step length in some situations. At the present stage it is therefore difficult to appraise the utility of this contribution.",

    "abstract": "Let $p>3$ be a prime and $b\\ge 2$ an integer such that $p$ does not divide $b$. Then $1/p$ has a periodic digit expansion with respect to the basis $b$. The length $q$ of the period is the (multiplicative) order of $b$ mod $p$. In the case $q=p-1$ a formula for the variance of the digits of a period was given previously. This formula involves a Dedekind sum. We determine the variance in the case $q=(p-1)/2$. If $p\\equiv 3$ mod 4 a Dedekind sum and the class number of $\\mathbb Q(\\sqrt{-p})$ occur in the respective formula. If $p\\equiv 1$ mod 4, the formula may be much more complex since it involves linear combinations of (possibly many) products of two Bernoulli numbers attached to odd characters.",

    "abstract": "The problem of drawing geographical maps is the one of mapping a subset of the sphere, representing a country or some other region on the surface of the Earth, into the Euclidean plane, minimising certain distortion properties that are specified in advance. It is known that from the purely mathematical point of view, this is an extremely difficult problem. One of Leonhard Euler's duties during his first stay at the Imperial Academy of Sciences of Saint Petersburg (1727-1741) was to help establishing maps of the Russian Empire. He worked on this project under the direction of the famous French geographer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle, who was the head of the astronomy and geography departments of the Academy. The general map of the Russian Empire, together with several maps of its particular regions were published under Euler's direction in the so-called Russian Atlas in 1745. In his later memoir ``De proiectione geographica De Lisliana in mappa generali imperii russici usitata'', written in 1777, Euler developed the mathematical theory of the method used by Delisle on a heuristic basis, which he himself used for drawing the general map of the Russian Empire. This method usually carries now the name Delisle--Euler map. In a previous paper, the first two authors of the present paper compared the Delisle--Euler map with several other maps of the conical type, with respect to various mathematical distorsion properties. They showed that this map is the best one from all the points of view considered, when it is applied to the drawing of the Russian Empire. In the present paper, we compare the Euler--Delisle map with a map which was not considered in the paper mentioned, namely, the so-called Lambert conformal conical projection, applied to the same region of the Earth. We show that the latter is better in several respects than all the other maps considered in the previous paper, including the Delisle--Euler map.",

    "abstract": "Movable antenna (MA) introduces a new degree of freedom for future wireless communication systems by enabling the adaptive adjustment of antenna positions. Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.",

    "abstract": "The notion of mutual visibility in graphs arises from constraining shortest paths by forbidding internal vertices from belonging to a specified subset. Mutual-visibility sets, originally introduced as a tool for studying information flow and structural restrictions in complex networks, have since gained increasing attention due to their theoretical significance and diverse applications. In this paper, a complete characterization of mutual-visibility sets in trees is presented. It is shown that a subset $S$ is a mutual-visibility set of $T$ if and only if it coincides with the set of leaves of the Steiner subtree $T\\langle S\\rangle$. As a consequence, the mutual-visibility number of a tree is equal to the number of its leaves. For trees containing branch vertices, the notion of legs is introduced and an explicit formula for the number of maximal mutual-visibility sets is derived in terms of the corresponding leg lengths. It is proved that every tree is absolute-clear. It is further established that the mutual-visibility number is preserved under the line graph operation for trees with at least two edges, that is, $\u03bc(L(T))=\u03bc(T)$.",

These are systems whose components can be either working or failed; the system can also be working or failed depending on the state of the components; and repairing a component cannot cause the system to fail. We consider that one or more components can fail simultaneously, allowing us to model external shocks and disasters. For this, we use the L\u00e9vy-frailty Marshall-Olkin (LFMO) multivariate distribution to model the failure times of the components. We aim to answer in which states of the system we should repair the components. This is a challenging question, as the number of repair policies grows super-exponentially in the number of components. To tackle this, we propose a simple family of repair policies, which we call $r$-out-of-$n$:R repair policies, where one repairs all failed components when the system fails or when there are $r$ or more failed components. Our main contribution is that we derive exact and simple expressions for key performance-evaluation quantities of the system operating under our proposed repair policies. That is, we give explicit expressions for the mean time-to-failure of the system, mean time-to-repair, probability of system-failure before repair, and component- and system-repair rate. We also give expressions for the expected cost and long-term average cost, when there are components' and system repair cost. The only relevant parameters involved in the derived expressions are the structural signature of the system, and the Laplace exponent associated to the LFMO distribution.",

In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.",

Associativity and $*$-compatibility are characterized by explicit algebraic identities. The framework recovers a range of known deformation procedures, including Rieffel, Kasprzak, and Drinfeld-type constructions, and also yields genuinely new deformations that do not arise from dual $2$--cocycles or crossed-product methods.\n  At the $C^*$-level, we identify a minimal reduced setting in which the deformed algebra admits a canonical completion, formulated in terms of boundedness of the deformed left regular action on the Haar--GNS space. This separates algebraic coherence from analytic implementability and clarifies the precise role of higher-order fusion data in deformation theory for locally compact quantum groups.

    "abstract": "In this paper, we concern with the ergodic linear-quadratic closed-loop optimal control problems with random periodic coefficients. We put forward the random periodic mean-square exponentially stable condition, and prove the random periodicity of solutions to state equation based on it. Then we prove the existence and uniqueness of random periodic solutions to two types of backward stochastic differential equations which serve as stochastic Riccati equations in the procedure of completing the square. With the random periodicity of state equation and stochastic Riccati equations, the ergodic cost functional on infinite horizon is simplified to an equivalent cost functional over a single periodic interval without limit. Finally, the closed-loop optimal controls are explicitly given based on random periodic solutions to state equation and stochastic Riccati equations.",

We propose a Langevin sampler for quantum tomography, that relies on a new formulation of Bayesian quantum tomography exploiting the Burer-Monteiro factorization of Hermitian positive-semidefinite matrices. If the rank of the target density matrix is known, this formulation allows us to define a posterior distribution that is only supported on matrices whose rank is upper-bounded by the rank of the target density matrix. Conversely, if the target rank is unknown, any upper bound on the rank can be used by our algorithm, and the rank of the resulting posterior mean estimator is further reduced by the use of a low-rank promoting prior density. This prior density is a complex extension of the one proposed in (Annales de l'Institut Henri Poincare Probability and Statistics, 56(2):1465-1483, 2020). We derive a PAC-Bayesian bound on our proposed estimator that matches the best bounds available in the literature, and we show numerically that it leads to strong scalability improvements compared to existing techniques when the rank of the density matrix is known to be small.",

    "abstract": "The rapid growth of urban populations and the increasing need for sustainable transportation solutions have prompted a shift towards electric buses in public transit systems. However, the effective management of mixed fleets consisting of both electric and diesel buses poses significant operational challenges. One major challenge is coping with dynamic electricity pricing, where charging costs vary throughout the day. Transit agencies must optimize charging assignments in response to such dynamism while accounting for secondary considerations such as seating constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model to address these challenges by jointly optimizing charging schedules and trip assignments for mixed (electric and diesel bus) fleets while considering factors such as dynamic electricity pricing, vehicle capacity, and route constraints. We address the potential computational intractability of the MILP formulation, which can arise even with relatively small fleets, by employing a hierarchical approach tailored to the fleet composition. By using real-world data from the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, we show that our approach can result in significant savings in the operating costs of the mixed transit fleets.",

Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality.

    "abstract": "We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.",

This choice of potential has the effect that the fluid mixture cannot fully separate into two pure phases. The notion of dissipative solutions is based on a relative energy-dissipation inequality featuring a suitable regularity weight. In this way, this is a very weak solution concept. In the present work, we study the well-posedness of the geodynamical two-phase flow in the notion of energy-variational solutions. They feature an additional scalar energy variable that majorizes the system energy along solutions and they are further characterized by a variational inequality that combines an energy-dissipation estimate with the weak formulation of the system adding an error term that accounts for the mismatch between the energy variable and the system energy multiplied by a suitable regularity weight. We give a comparison of these two concepts. We further study different phase-field potentials for the geodynamical two-phase flow model. In particular, we address the variational limit from a potential with a logarithmic contribution to a double-obstacle potential, then also allowing for the emergence of pure phases. This study underlines that, thanks to its structure, the energy-variational solution is better suited for variational convergence methods than the dissipative solution.",

In the mixed case, each $p$-interaction layer is assumed either to have regularly varying tails with exponent $\u03b1_p$ or to satisfy a finite $2p$-th moment condition.\n  For the pure spherical $p$-spin model with regularly varying disorder of tail index $\u03b1$, we introduce a tail-adapted normalization that interpolates between the classical Gaussian scaling and the extreme-value scale, and we prove a sharp universality dichotomy for the quenched free energy. In the subcritical regime $\u03b1<2p$, the thermodynamics is driven by finitely many extremal couplings and the free energy converges to a non-degenerate random limit described by the NIM (non-intersecting monomial) model, depending only on extreme-order statistics. At the critical exponent $\u03b1=2p$, we obtain a random one-dimensional TAP-type variational formula capturing the coexistence of an extremal spike and a universal Gaussian bulk on spherical slices. In the supercritical regime $\u03b1>2p$ (more generally, under a finite $2p$-th moment assumption), the free energy is universal and agrees with the deterministic Crisanti--Sommers/Parisi value of the corresponding Gaussian model, as established in [Sawhney-Sellke'24].\n  We then extend the subcritical and critical results to mixed spherical models in which each $p$-layer is either heavy-tailed with $\u03b1_p\\le 2p$ or has finite $2p$-th moment.

In large alphabet datasets such as text corpora, such side information arises naturally through word semantics/similarities that can be inferred by closeness of vector word embeddings, for instance. We consider two specific models for side information--a local model where the unknown distribution is in the neighborhood of a known distribution, and a partial ordering model where the alphabet is partitioned into known higher and lower probability sets. In both models, we theoretically characterize the improvement in a suitable squared-error risk because of the available side information. Simulations over natural language and synthetic data illustrate these gains.",

    "abstract": "We present a latent-stock compartmental framework for modeling degree production systems when only completion flows, rather than enrollments, are observed. Applied to U.S.\\ mathematics degrees from 1969 to 2017, the model treats master's and PhD populations as latent compartments -- unobserved state variables that are inferred indirectly because they generate the observed completion flows -- with time-varying routing fractions and completion hazards. Using information-criterion model comparison across a grid of specifications, we find strong support for smooth nonlinear time variation in routing fractions and hazards, while models with explicit international forcing are disfavored. The preferred model achieves a log-scale root mean squared error of approximately 0.036, corresponding to a typical multiplicative error of about 4\\% in fitted degree counts, and highlights key structural shifts in the graduate pipeline: the master's pathway became increasingly central to PhD production through the late twentieth century before weakening, while direct bachelor's-to-PhD entry remained small but persistent. Estimated completion hazards for both degrees rise over time, indicating faster effective turnover in the graduate compartments. Methodologically, our main contribution is a latent stock dynamical approach that recasts linked degreecompletion time series as a coherent stock-flow system when intermediate enrollments are unobserved, making explicit both what features of pipeline dynamics are identifiable from completion data alone and what limitations such data impose.",

Evidence suggests that amyloid beta and cerebrovascular pathology are mutually reinforcing; in particular, amyloid beta suppresses perfusion by constricting capillaries, and hypoperfusion promotes the production of amyloid beta. Here, we propose a whole-brain model coupling amyloid beta and blood vessel through a hybrid model consisting of a reaction-diffusion system for the protein dynamics and porous-medium model of blood flow within and between vascular networks: arterial, capillary and venous. We discretize the resulting parabolic--elliptic system of PDEs by means of a high-order discontinuous Galerkin method in space and an implicit Euler scheme in time. Simulations in realistic brain geometries demonstrate the emergence of multistability, implying that a sufficiently large pathogenic protein seeds is necessary to trigger disease outbreak. Motivated by the \"two-hit vascular hypothesis\" of Alzheimer's disease that hypoperfusive vascular damage triggers amyloid beta pathology, we also demonstrate that localized hypoperfusion, in response to injury, can destabilize the healthy steady state and trigger brain-wide disease outbreak.",

This grading is a refinement of the Alexander grading used in knot Floer homology. Then we define a graded Lagrangian intersection, in two variables, between concrete Lagrangian submanifolds arising from the curves of the diagram in the symmetric power of the quantum Heegaard surface. The two-variable intersection unifies and recovers the Jones and Alexander polynomials as two specialisations of coefficients. Moreover, this leads to knot Floer homology on one side and provides an intersection model for the Jones polynomial on the other.

    "abstract": "Portfolio optimization (PO) is a core tool in financial and operational decision-making, typically balancing expected profit and risk. In real-world applications, particularly in the energy sector, decision variables can be expressed as physical quantities (e.g., production volumes), and nonlinear performance metrics such as Return on Investment (ROI) may be requested. These modeling choices introduce challenges, including the non-additivity of the objective function. This often results in highly concentrated optimized portfolios and thus limited diversification, which can be problematic for decision-makers seeking balanced investment strategies. This paper proposes two strategies to enhance diversification in ROI-based PO models, both based on the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). The first incorporates an HHI term directly into the objective function, with its corresponding weight allowing control over diversification. The second directly maximizes diversification while controlling expected profit and risk degradation around the optimum portfolio (obtained through conventional PO). Both strategies are evaluated using synthetic data (energy assets) to illustrate their behavior and practical trade-offs. The results highlight how each method can support different decision-making needs and enhance portfolio robustness.",

Under suitable assumptions on the operators and model parameters, Lyapunov-based techniques are employed to establish finite-time and fixed-time convergence of the generated trajectories.\n  While both systems exhibit accelerated convergence, the settling time of the finite-time stable system depends on the initial condition, whereas the fixed-time stable system admits a uniform upper bound on the convergence time that is independent of the initial state. Moreover, an explicit forward Euler discretization of the continuous-time dynamics leads to a proximal point-type algorithm that preserves the fixed-time convergence property.

    "abstract": "The Radial Spanning Tree (RST) in dimension $d\\geq2$ is a random geometric graph constructed on a homogeneous Poisson point process $\\mathcal N$ in $\\mathbb R^d$ augmented by the origin, with edges connecting each $x\\in\\mathcal N$ to the nearest point $y\\in\\mathcal N\\cup\\{0\\}$ that lies closer to $0$ than $x$, with respect to the Euclidean distance. By construction, it forms almost surely a tree rooted at $0$. The RST was introduced in 2007 by Baccelli and Bordenave, who investigated straightness, a deterministic property introduced by Howard and Newman in 2001, to derive information about the asymptotic directions of infinite branches. They proved that the RST is almost surely straight in dimension $2$, which directly implies that all infinite branches are asymptotically directed, every possibility is attained, and directions reached by multiple infinite branches form a dense subset. However, their approach relies crucially on planarity, preventing any straightforward extension to higher dimensions. In this paper, we close this gap by proving that the RST is almost surely \\emph{straight} in any dimension, thereby obtaining the same consequences for the behavior of infinite branches. Our approach resolves the key barriers in the study of the RST, notably those posed by the complex dependency structure combined with the radial nature of the model, and especially beyond the planar setting. It relies on tools developed for the analysis of the Directed Spanning Forest, a closely related model, including recent progress by the author in 2025. Specifically, a key contribution of this work is the construction of a suitable renewal-type decomposition of RST paths. Leveraging this decomposition together with classical concentration inequalities, we show that RST paths cannot deviate far from straight lines and derive straightness.",

    "abstract": "Dynamical systems are essential to model various phenomena in physics, finance, economics, and are also of current interest in machine learning. A central modeling task is investigating parameter sensitivity, whether tuning atmospheric coefficients, computing financial Greeks, or optimizing neural networks. These sensitivities are mathematically expressed as derivatives of an objective function with respect to parameters of interest and are rarely available analytically, necessitating numerical methods for approximating them. While the literature for differentiation of deterministic systems is well-covered, the treatment of stochastic systems, such as stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in most curricula is less comprehensive than the subtleties arising from the interplay of noise and discretization require.\n  This paper provides a primer on numerical differentiation of SDEs organized as a two-tale narrative. Tale 1 demonstrates differentiating through discretized SDEs, known the discretize-optimize approach, is reliable for both It\u00f4 and Stratonovich calculus. Tale 2 examines the optimize-discretize approach, investigating the continuous limit of backward equations from Tale 1 corresponding to the desired gradients. Our aim is to equip readers with a clear guide on the numerical differentiation of SDEs: computing gradients correctly in both It\u00f4 and Stratonovich settings, understanding when discretize-optimize and optimize-discretize agree or diverge, and developing intuition for reasoning about stochastic differentiation beyond the cases explicitly covered.",

In this paper we classify Rota{Baxter operators of weights zero and one on such algebras. We prove that every Rota{Baxter operator is upper triangular with respect to a natural basis. For weight zero, a strong rigidity phenomenon occurs: the operators are diagonal up to possible perturbations supported in the last basis vector. For weight one, a richer structure appears, including both triangular and non-triangular families, with the diagonal entries governed by a rational recurrence relation. Our results provide a complete description of Rota{Baxter operators on nilpotent evolution algebras of maximal nilindex.",

    "abstract": "The 2D Euler system, governing inviscid incompressible flow, admits infinitely many steady solutions. To identify which are physically realizable, we investigate the vanishing viscosity limit of the steady Navier-Stokes system. Here, a steady Euler flow with a slip boundary condition is called a vanishing viscosity limit if it is the $L^\\infty_{\\textup{loc}}\\cap H^1_{\\textup{loc}}$ limit of steady Navier-Stokes solutions (it is known that strong boundary layers can persist). We then completely classify the vanishing viscosity limit in specific planar domains.\n  In a bounded connected domain, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limit is the constant-vorticity flow. This result does not require the approximating Navier-Stokes solutions to have nested closed streamlines, an essential assumption in the century-old Prandtl-Batchelor theorem. In a strip where the Navier-Stokes velocity (but not the pressure) is periodic in the strip direction, we show that the only vanishing viscosity limits are constant flow, Couette flow, and Poiseuille flow. The proof of the latter result relies on the former and on a powerful rigidity theorem, which asserts that any non-shear steady Euler flow in a periodic strip must have contractible closed streamlines.",

    "abstract": "This Ph.D. thesis reports on progress in rigorously establishing hydrodynamic principles from the microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics of quantum many-body systems in a general, non-model-specific manner. Using the C*-algebra framework of statistical mechanics, we treat systems directly in the thermodynamic limit, primarily focusing on quantum lattice models where tools such as Lieb-Robinson bounds yield rigorous statements. We thus provide a proof-of-principle that large-scale behaviours can indeed be seen as emerging from microscopic dynamics, with mathematical proof. We first report on ergodicity results in short-range models with exponentially decaying or finite-range interactions. We show that time-averaged observables converge to their ensemble averages and decorrelate from all other observables almost everywhere within the light-cone defined by Lieb-Robinson bounds. This relaxation property indicates the loss of information at large scales, from which we prove a Boltzmann-Gibbs principle: at the Euler scaling limit of large time and distance, observables project onto hydrodynamic modes (extensive conserved quantities), within correlation functions. These results hold independently of microscopic details, capturing the physical idea that such details are lost at large space-time scales. Regarding finer scales of hydrodynamics, we discuss rigorous lower bounds on the strength of diffusion. We establish a general result on the clustering of n-th order connected correlations within C* dynamical systems. These results are applied to obtain a strictly positive lower bound on the diffusion constant of chaotic open quantum spin chains with nearest-neighbor interactions. This thesis underlines the universality of hydrodynamic principles, provides a framework for establishing them rigorously, and sets the stage for future progress toward the goal of proving the hydrodynamic equations.",

A notable instance occurs in locally conformal analysis, where local representatives coincide only up to conformal factors. The locally conformal approach not only enables the definition of novel and rich geometric structures but also provides Hamiltonian formulations for irreversible systems, yielding physically meaningful dynamical consequences. While extensively studied for symplectic, cosymplectic, and Poisson geometries, its systematic extension to multi-Hamiltonian settings remains largely unexplored.\n  In this work, we investigate locally conformally Nambu--Poisson and locally conformally generalized Poisson manifolds, showing that these structures naturally induce Nambu--Jacobi and generalized Jacobi manifolds, respectively. From a dynamical point of view, we construct Hamiltonian-type evolution equations, and for locally conformal $3$-Nambu structures, we introduce locally conformal bi-Hamiltonian systems. The resulting dynamics are particularly suitable for modeling irreversible multi-Hamiltonian processes, as they generally do not preserve the system's energy.\n  Collectively, this work provides a unified framework for understanding both the geometric structures and Hamiltonian dynamics of classical, Nambu--Poisson, and generalized Poisson manifolds within a locally conformal context.",

    "abstract": "Since its introduction as a Maker-Breaker positional game by Duch\u00eane et al. in 2020, the Maker-Breaker domination game has become one of the most studied positional games on vertices. In this game, two players, Dominator and Staller, alternately claim an unclaimed vertex of a given graph G. If at some point the set of vertices claimed by Dominator is a dominating set, she wins; otherwise, i.e. if Staller manages to isolate a vertex by claiming all its closed neighborhood, Staller wins.\n  Given a graph G and a first player, Dominator or Staller must have a winning strategy. We are interested in the computational complexity of determining which player has such a strategy. This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete on bipartite graphs of bounded degree and split graphs; polynomial on cographs, outerplanar graphs, and block graphs; and in NP for interval graphs.\n  In this paper, we consider the parameterized complexity of this game. We start by considering as a parameter the number of moves of both players. We prove that for the general framework of Maker-Breaker positional games in hypergraphs, determining whether Breaker can claim a transversal of the hypergraph in k moves is W[2]-complete, in contrast to the problem of determining whether Maker can claim all the vertices of a hyperedge in k moves, which is known to be W[1]-complete since 2017. These two hardness results are then applied to the Maker-Breaker domination game, proving that it is W[2]-complete to decide if Dominator can dominate the graph in k moves and W[1]-complete to decide if Staller can isolate a vertex in k moves. Next, we provide FPT algorithms for the Maker-Breaker domination game parameterized by the neighborhood diversity, the modular width, the P4-fewness, the distance to cluster, and the feedback edge number.",

Also, for linear networks that are not weakly reversible, we show that every species outside a terminal strongly connected component undergoes strong extinction. Moreover, in order to further emphasize the difference between weak and strong extinction, we construct an example of a reaction system (based on the Ivanova network) that exhibits weak extinction for all the species, but does not exhibit strong extinction in any species.",

Thus, we demonstrate that the $L^{\\infty}$ assumption is essential for the doubling of variables argument, and hence for the uniqueness of entropy solutions to scalar conservation laws. On the positive side, we develop a novel theory for scalar conservation laws with spatial heterogeneity by adapting the front tracking method. We recover uniqueness by imposing a Lax-type condition in addition to the entropy inequality, motivated by the properties of our front tracking approximations. Unbounded Kru\u017ekov solutions do not necessarily satisfy the weak formulation; we show that global weak solutions may not even exist in a natural class for some Cauchy problems of this form, even when Kru\u017ekov entropy solutions exist.

The formulation introduces auxiliary variables including the trace-free velocity gradient, a symmetric pseudo-stress tensor, the concentration gradient, and a semi-advective microorganism flux, which also allows for a consistent treatment of Robin-type boundary condition. The variational problem is posed within a Banach space framework and reformulated as a fixed-point operator. Existence of solutions follows from Schauder's theorem, while uniqueness is obtained under suitable data assumptions. The discrete problem is constructed using Raviart--Thomas finite element spaces together with piecewise polynomial approximations on macroelement-structured meshes, and existence of discrete solutions is established via Brouwer's theorem. An a priori error analysis yields optimal convergence rates. We further derive a residual-based a posteriori error estimator and prove its reliability using global inf-sup conditions, Helmholtz decompositions, and suitable projection operators, while efficiency is ensured through localization techniques and bubble functions. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions confirm the theoretical results, demonstrate the effectiveness of adaptive refinement for singular solutions and complex geometries with inclusions, and illustrate the robustness of the method for a bioconvective benchmark with plume formation governed by an Einstein--Batchelor-type viscosity law.",

The rapid increase in problem dimensions over the years calls for computationally cheap DFRO algorithms, that is, algorithms requiring as few function evaluations and retractions as possible. We propose a novel DFRO method based on finite-difference gradient approximations that relies on an adaptive selection of the finite-difference accuracy and stepsize that is novel even in the Euclidean setting. When endowed with an intrinsic finite-difference scheme, that measures variations of the objective in tangent directions using retractions, our proposed method requires $O(d\u03b5^{-2})$ function evaluations and retractions to find an $\u03b5$-critical point, where $d$ is the manifold dimension. We then propose a variant of our method when the search space is a Riemannian submanifold of an $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. This variant relies on an extrinsic finite-difference scheme, approximating the Riemannian gradient directly in the embedding space, assuming that the objective function can be evaluated outside of the manifold. This approach leads to worst-case complexity bounds of $O(d\u03b5^{-2})$ function evaluations and $O(\u03b5^{-2})$ retractions. We also present numerical results showing that the proposed methods achieve superior performance over existing derivative-free methods on various problems in both Euclidean and Riemannian settings.",

    "abstract": "Let us denote elements of the symmetric group $S_n$ using square brackets for the one-line notation. Cycles will be represented using parentheses, following the standard cycle notation. Under this convention, the full reversal of the identity element $()$ is the element $s = [n\\ n-1 \\dots 1]$. In the present work, we obtain a lower bound on the decomposition complexity of elements $s(1n \\dots 2)^{i}$ into the generators $(12), (12 \\dots n), (1n \\dots 2)$, where $i$ ranges over the set $\\{1,2,\\dots,n\\}$. As a consequence, we derive the lower bound $n(n-1)/2$ for the diameter of Cayley graph of the group $S_n$ generated by $(12), (12 \\dots n), (1n \\dots 2)$.",

We say $\\mathcal{D}$ is $G$-point-locally dihedral if the induced local action $G_x^{\\mathcal{D}(x)}$ is dihedral for each point $x$, and say $\\mathcal{D}$ is $G$-block-locally dihedral if the induced local action $G_B^B$ is dihedral for each block $B$. The design $\\mathcal{D}$ is called $G$-locally dihedral if both conditions hold. We give a classification of primitive permutation groups with dihedral point stabilizers, and apply it to classify point-locally dihedral block designs. For symmetric designs with a dihedral local action, we show that $G_x$ and $G_B$ are conjugate in $G$. Moreover, both local actions are faithful, and $G$ acts imprimitively on both points and blocks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we establish nonexistence results for complete translating solitons of the r-mean curvature flow under suitable growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature and on the norm of the second fundamental form. We first show that such solitons cannot be entirely contained in the complement of a right rotational cone whose axis of symmetry is aligned with the translation direction. We then relax the growth condition on the (r-1)-mean curvature and prove that properly immersed translating solitons cannot be confined to certain half-spaces opposite to the translation direction. We conclude the paper by showing that complete, properly immersed translating solitons satisfying appropriate growth conditions on the (r-1)-mean curvature cannot lie completely within the intersection of two transversal vertical half-spaces.",

The conformal deformation does not arise from geometric flows like the Ricci flow, since it is known that such flows might generate conjugate points in the presence of points of positive curvature in the surface.",

    "title": "Optimal Dirac controls for time-periodic bistable ODEs, application to population replacement",
    "abstract": "This work addresses an optimal control problem on a dynamics governed by a nonlinear differential equation with a bistable time-periodic nonlinearity. This problem, relevant in population dynamics, models the strategy of replacing a population of A-type individuals by a population of B-type individuals in a time-varying environment, focusing on the evolution of the proportion of B-type individuals among the whole population. The control term accounts for the instant release of B-type individuals. Our main goal, after noting some interesting properties on the differential equation, is to determine the optimal time at which this release should be operated to ensure population replacement while minimizing the release effort. The results establish that the optimal release time appears to be the minimizer of a function involving the carrying capacity of the environment and the threshold periodic solution of the dynamics; they also describe the convergence of the whole optimal release strategy. An application to the biocontrol of mosquito populations using Wolbachia-infected individuals illustrates the relevance of the theoretical results. Wolbachia is a bacterium that helps preventing the transmission of some viruses from mosquitoes to humans, making the optimization of Wolbachia propagation in a mosquito population a crucial issue.",

    "title": "Truncated Multidimensional Trigonometric Moment Problem: A Choice of Bases and the Unique Solution",
    "abstract": "In this prelinimary version of paper, we propose to give a complete solution to the Truncated Multidimensional Trigonometric Moment Problem (TMTMP) from a system and signal processing perspective. In mathematical TMTMPs, people care about whether a solution exists for a given sequence of multidimensional trigonometric moments. The solution can have the form of an atomic measure. However, for the TMTMPs in system and signal processing, a solution as an analytic rational function, of which the numerator and the denominator are positive polynomials, is desired for the ARMA modelling of a stochastic process, which is the so-called Multidimensional Rational Covariance Extension problem (RCEP) . In the literature, the feasible domain of the TMTMPs, where the spectral density is positive, is difficult to obtain given a specific choice of basis functions, which causes severe problems in the Multidimensional RCEP. In this paper, we propose a choice of basis functions, and a corresponding estimation scheme by convex optimization, for the TMTMPs, with which the trigonometric moments of the spectral estimate are exactly the sample moments. We propose an explicit condition for the convex optimization problem for guaranteeing the positiveness of the spectral estimation. The map from the parameters of the estimate to the trigonometric moments is proved to be a diffeomorphism, which ensures the existence and uniqueness of solution. The statistical properties of the proposed spectral density estimation scheme are comprehensively proved, including the consistency, (asymptotical) unbiasedness, convergence rate and efficiency under a mild assumption. This well-posed treatment is then applied to a system identification task, and the simulation results validate our proposed treatment for the TMTMP in system and signal processing.",

This nonlinear wave equation is widely used in nonlinear acoustics and it is especially important in biomedical applications such as ultra-sound imaging in human tissue. Modern methods are applied to uncover point symmetries and conservation laws that can lead to useful developments concerning solutions and their properties. A complete classification of point symmetries is shown for the arbitrary function. Local low-order conservation laws related to net mass of sound waves are obtained by the multiplier method. Two potential systems are derived yielding potential symmetries and nonlocal conservation laws. For the physical case interesting for this equation, travelling wave solutions are studied leading to shock waves.",

The key innovation of our approach is the use of a sequence of Langevin samplers to enable efficient simulation of the flow. Specifically, these Langevin samplers are employed (i) to generate samples from the interpolant distribution at intermediate times and (ii) to construct, starting from these intermediate times, a robust estimator of the velocity field governing the flow ODE. For both applications of the Langevin diffusions, we establish convergence guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on challenging multimodal distributions across a range of dimensions, as well as its effectiveness in Bayesian inference tasks.",

We propose the PVM, a duality free framework that reformulates the constrained problem as the unconstrained minimisation of a value function. The resulting problem always has a solution, yields a certificate of infeasibility and is amenable to warm starting. We develop a second order algorithm for Quadratic Programming based on the PPA and semismooth Newton methods, and establish sufficient conditions for superlinear convergence to an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of the solution. Numerical experiments on a MPC problem demonstrate competitive performance with state of the art solvers from a cold start and up to 70\\% reduction in Newton iterations when warm starting.",
