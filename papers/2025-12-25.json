    "title": "Energy-Gain Control of Time-Varying Systems: Receding Horizon Approximation",
    "abstract": "Standard formulations of prescribed worstcase disturbance energy-gain control policies for linear time-varying systems depend on all forward model data. In a discrete-time setting, this dependence arises through a backward Riccati recursion. The aim herein is to consider the infinite-horizon $\\ell_2$ gain performance of state feedback policies with only finite receding-horizon preview of the model parameters. The proposed synthesis of controllers subject to such a constraint leverages the strict contraction of lifted Riccati operators under uniform controllability and observability. The main approximation result establishes a sufficient number of preview steps for the performance loss to remain below any set tolerance, relative to the baseline gain bound of the associated infinite-preview controller. Aspects of the main result are explored in the context of a numerical example.",

    "abstract": "A factor of a graph is essentially a specific type spanning subgraph. The study of characterizing the existence of $[a, b]$-factors based on eigenvalue conditions can be traced back to the work of Brouwer and Haemers (2005) on perfect matchings. With the advancement of graphs factor theory, the related spectral extremal problems, particularly the study of $[a,b]$-factors and fractional $[a,b]$-factors, have been widely studied by scholars. Our work is motivated by research related to the $[a,b]$-factors and fractional $[a,b]$-factors, and explores their generalizations: $(a,b,k)$-critical graphs and fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical graphs. A graph $G$ is called an $(a,b,k)$-critical (a fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical) graph if after deleting any $k$ vertices of $G$ the remaining graph of $G$ has an $[a,b]$-factor (a fractional $[a,b]$-factor). In this paper, we establish spectral radius conditions for a graph to be $(a,b,k)$-critical or fractional $(a,b,k)$-critical. When $k=0$, our results also resolve some open problems concerning $[a, b]$-factors and fractional $[a, b]$-factors.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a model-free solution to the stochastic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem for linear discrete-time systems with both multiplicative and additive noises. We formulate the stochastic LQR problem as a nonconvex optimization problem and rigorously analyze its dual problem structure. By exploiting the inherent convexity of the dual problem and analyzing Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions with respect to optimality in convex optimization, we establish an explicit relationship between the optimal point of the dual problem and the parameters of the associated Q-function. This theoretical insight, combined with the technique of the matrix direct sum, makes it possible to develop a novel model-free sample-efficient, non-iterative semidefinite programming algorithm that directly estimates optimal control gain without requiring an initial stabilizing controller, or noises measurability. The robustness of the model-free SDP method to errors is investigated. Our approach provides a new optimization-theoretic framework for understanding Q-learning algorithms while advancing the theoretical foundations of reinforcement learning in stochastic optimal control. Numerical validation on a pulse-width modulated inverter system demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness, particularly in achieving a single-step non-iterative solution without hyper-parameter tuning.",

    "abstract": "Rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) has emerged as a promising technique for efficient interference management in next-generation wireless networks. While most existing studies focus on downlink and single-cell designs, the modeling and analysis of uplink RSMA under large-scale deployments remain largely unexplored. On the basis of stochastic geometry (SG), this paper introduces a unified analytical framework that integrates finite modulation and coding scheme (MCS)-based rate adaptation. This framework jointly captures spatial interference coupling and discrete rate behavior to bridge theoretical tractability and practical realism. Within this framework, we derive tractable expressions for the conditional received rate (CRR), its spatial average, and higher-order statistics via the meta distribution, thereby quantifying both the mean and user-specific rate performance. Results show that the proposed unified framework not only generalizes existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal multiple access (OMA) analyses but also provides new insights into how discrete rate adaptation reshapes interference dynamics and fairness in dense RSMA-enabled networks.",

In that case, the limiting characteristic function admits an explicit infinite-product factorization whose local factors depend only on the underlying digit system. We also indicate conditional extensions of this two-series criterion to Ostrowski numeration systems with bounded partial quotients and to Parry $\u03b2$-expansions with Pisot-Vijayaraghavan base $\u03b2$.",

    "abstract": "We establish multi-scale convergence theory for a class of Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs in space of probability measures. They arise from context of hydrodynamic limit of N-particle deterministic action minimizing (global) Lagrangian dynamics.\n  From a Lagrangian point of view, this can also be viewed as a limit result on two scale convergence of action minimizing probability-measure-valued paths. However, we focus on the Hamiltonian formulation here mostly. We derive and study convergence of the associated abstract but scalar Hamilton-Jacobi equations, defined in space of probability measures. There is an infinite dimensional singular averaging structure within these equations. We develop an indirect variational approach to apply finite dimensional weak K.A.M. theory to such infinite dimensional setting here. With a weakly interacting particle assumption, the averaging step only involves that of individual particles, which is implicitly but rigorously treated using the weak K.A.M. theory. Consequently, we can close the above mentioned averaging step by identifying limiting Hamiltonian, and arrive at a rigorous convergence result on solutions of the nonlinear PDEs in space of probability measures.\n  In technical development parts of the paper, we devise new viscosity solution techniques regarding projection of equations with a submetry structure in state space, multi-scale convergence for certain abstract Hamilton-Jacobi equations in metric spaces, as well as comparison principles for equations in space of probability measures. The space of probability measure we consider is a special case of Alexandrov metric space with curvature bounded from below. Since some results are better explained in such metric space setting, we also develop some techniques in the general settings which are of independent interests.",

Our approach offers a refined perspective on large-party bias: rather than viewing large parties as simply receiving more seats, we show that they instead obtain their seats earlier in the apportionment sequence.

Rather than treating triadic multiplication as an optional variation of binary algebra, we adopt it as an \\emph{algebraic necessity} for modeling systems whose elementary interactions are intrinsically three-body and whose operational modes are indexed by parameters $\u0393$.\n  We construct the prime spectrum $\\Spec_\u0393(T)$ and its Zariski topology, prove functoriality, and build the structure sheaf $\\Ocal_{\\Spec_\u0393(T)}$ via local fraction descriptions that must simultaneously respect triadic associativity and the sheaf gluing axioms. A key technical point is ensuring that local representations by ternary-parametric fractions glue uniquely, despite the absence of a binary product and despite the parameter dependence of the multiplication law. We then define sheaves of $\u0393$-modules, quasi-coherent sheaves associated to algebraic modules, and the cohomology groups $H^i(X,\\Fcal)$ as derived functors of global sections. Finally, we give a concrete finite \\emph{structural example} (a ternary $\u0393$-version of $\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$) and compute its $\u0393$-spectrum explicitly, thereby exhibiting nontrivial spectral behavior in a fully finite setting.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we introduce a three-precision formulation of the General Alternating-Direction Implicit method (GADI) designed to accelerate the solution of large-scale sparse linear systems $Ax=b$. GADI is a framework that can represent many existing Alternating-Direction Implicit (ADI) methods. These methods are a class of linear solvers based on a splitting of $A$ such that the solution of the original linear system can be decomposed into the successive computation of easy-to-solve structured subsystems. Our proposed mixed precision scheme for GADI solves these subsystems in low precision to reduce the overall execution time while computing the residual and solution update in high precision to enable the solution to converge to high accuracy. We develop a rounding error analysis of mixed precision GADI that establishes the rates of convergence of the forward and backward errors to certain limiting accuracies. Our analysis also highlights the conditions on the splitting matrices under which mixed precision GADI is guaranteed to converge for a given set of precisions. We then discuss a systematic and robust strategy for selecting the GADI regularization parameter $\u03b1$, whose adjustment is critical for performance. Specifically, our proposed strategy makes use of a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model trained on a dataset of low-dimensional problems to initialize $\u03b1$. Finally, we proceed to a performance analysis of mixed precision GADI on an NVIDIA A100 GPU to validate our approach. Using low precision (Bfloat16 or FP32) to solve the subsystems, we obtain speedups of $2.6\\times$, $1.7\\times$, and $3.1\\times$ over a full double precision GADI implementation on large-scale 2D, 3D convection-diffusion and complex reaction-diffusion problems (up to $1.3\\times 10^{8}$ unknowns), respectively.",

The microscopic model involves a variable viscosity tensor, a non-conservative source term in the Cahn--Hilliard equation, and mixed boundary conditions: no-slip on the outer boundary and Navier slip with zero tangential stress on the surfaces of the solid inclusions. The capillarity strength $\u03bb^\\varepsilon>0$ depends on the microscopic scale $\\varepsilon>0$.\n  The analysis consists of two main parts. First, for each fixed $\\varepsilon>0$, we prove the existence of a weak solution on a finite time interval $(0,T)$ and derive a priori estimates that are uniform with respect to $\\varepsilon$ (and $\u03bb^\\varepsilon$). Second, we perform the periodic homogenization for the perforated setting, a limit $\\varepsilon\\to0$. Depending on the limit value $\u03bb$ of the capillarity strength $\u03bb^\\varepsilon$, we obtain two distinct effective models: (i) in the vanishing capillarity regime $\u03bb=0$, the limit system is of Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard type, with no macroscopic convection or advection; (ii) in the balanced regime $\u03bb\\in(0,+\\infty)$, we derive a Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system with nonlinear convection and advective transport of the phase field at the macroscopic scale.

As a consequence of this result, we provide an upper bound for the second Neumann eigenvalue and a lower bound for the largest Neumann eigenvalue on trees. Then, we obtain a sharp upper bound for the second Neumann eigenvalue on paths in terms of its diameter, and as an application, we show that the second Neumann eigenvalue cannot be bounded below by a positive real number on the family of paths.

Notably, the leading coefficients are merely required to be sufficiently small in BMO, which is strictly weaker than the VMO condition. In the complex setting, the well-posedness of this problem was recently investigated in [W. Kim, M. Vestberg, Existence, uniqueness and regularity for elliptic $p$-Laplace systems with complex coefficients,arXiv:2503.18932], where the authors established a strong accretivity condition on the leading coefficients, and this structural condition allows them to derive Schauder-type estimates for weak solutions. In our study, it has already been observed that gaining existence and uniqueness of weak solutions is possible under a natural and less restrictive assumption on the complex-valued coefficients. Following this direction, we prove a global Cader\u00f3n-Zygmund-type estimate for weak solutions, from which the Morrey-space regularity follows as a consequence. This paper is a contribution to the better understanding of solution behavior and may be viewed as part of a series of works aimed at extending regularity theory in the complex-valued setting.",

This perspective suggests the possibility of a more general minimax theorem from which a wide array of game-theoretic results would follow. After developing a new framing of game-theoretic probability via gamble spaces, we prove such a theorem for finite time. Applying this minimax theorem to games derived from existing measure-theoretic statements, we prove several existing and novel game-theoretic statements.

When pure Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied to the displacement, the leading block of the resulting algebraic system becomes almost singular in the nearly incompressible (locking) regime, hindering efficient iterative solution. To overcome this, the system is reformulated as a three-field problem with an inherent regularization that maintains the original solution while ensuring nonsingularity. Analysis shows that both the minimal residual (MINRES) and generalized minimal residual (GMRES) methods, when preconditioned with inexact block diagonal and triangular Schur complement preconditioners, achieve convergence independent of mesh size and the locking parameter for the regularized system. Similar theoretical results are established for the situation with displacement subject to mixed boundary conditions, even without regularization. Numerical experiments in 2D and 3D confirm the benefits of regularization under pure Dirichlet conditions and the robustness of the preconditioners with respect to mesh size and the locking parameter in both boundary condition scenarios. Finally, a spinal cord simulation with discontinuous material parameters further illustrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed iterative solvers.",

A key ingredient of the analysis is a dispersive estimate for the transport flow, which quantifies decay effects generated by spatial propagation. Using this dispersive mechanism, we obtain improved bounds for the nonlinear collision operator and show that small solutions near the vacuum can be propagated on time scales significantly longer than those dictated by conservation laws alone.

This is modeled by the so-called crowd-sourcing model, where the answer of expert $i$ on question $k$ is modeled by a random entry, parametrized by $M_{i,k}$ which is increasing linearly with the expected quality of the answer. To enable the unambiguous ranking of the experts by ability, several assumptions on $M$ are available in the literature. We consider here the general isotonic crowd-sourcing model, where $M$ is assumed to be isotonic up to an unknown permutation $\u03c0^*$ of the experts - namely, $M_{\u03c0^{*-1}(i),k} \\geq M_{\u03c0^{*-1}(i+1),k}$ for any $i\\in [n-1], k \\in [d]$. Then, ranking experts amounts to constructing an estimator of $\u03c0^*$. In particular, we investigate here the existence of statistically optimal and computationally efficient procedures and we describe recent results that disprove the existence of computational-statistical gaps for this problem. To provide insights on the key ideas, we start by discussing simpler and yet related sub-problems, namely sub-matrix detection and estimation. This corresponds to specific instances of the ranking problem where the matrix $M$ is constrained to be of the form $\u03bb\\mathbf 1\\{S\\times T\\}$ where $S\\subset [n], T\\subset [d]$.

The tropical theory retains the full complexity of renormalization with nested and overlapping vertex subdivergences and infinitely many primitive graphs.\n  We compute the perturbation series of the tropical renormalization group functions exactly to 400 loops and study their asymptotic growth. In the minimal subtraction scheme, we find only an arithmetic sequence of singularities on the negative real axis in the Borel plane. These singularities are confluent and imply that the large-order perturbative asymptotics contain logarithmic and fractional power corrections. The absence of any further singularities suggests these series are Borel summable. In contrast, in a kinematic subtraction scheme, the singularity structure on the negative axis changes, and we find additional singularities on the positive real axis.",

    "title": "Synthetic Fluency and Epistemic Offloading in Undergraduate Mathematics in the Age of AI",
    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in higher education is transforming how students engage with undergraduate mathematics, raising concerns about learning and assessment validity. This study examines the impact of AI accessibility across a two-semester, multi-course dataset including Business Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Calculus III. By comparing unproctored homework and proctored exam performance, we analyze how student learning behaviors shift in AI-accessible environments, particularly through epistemic off-loading of mathematical work. Guided by a sociocognitive framework, we employ complementary measures -- performance gaps, homework-exam correlations, and Wasserstein distance -- to characterize divergence between practice and mastery. Results reveal a growing integrity gap as course content shifts from procedural to conceptual and spatially intensive mathematics. In both Business Calculus and Linear Algebra, differences in homework format (online versus hand-written, TA-graded) do not yield substantively different performance patterns, indicating that paper-based homework is not inherently more resistant to AI-mediated offloading. While homework retains partial predictive validity in procedural courses, upper-division courses exhibit a collapse in alignment between homework and exams, indicating that unproctored assessments increasingly reflect synthetic fluency rather than internalized understanding. These findings highlight the need to rethink assessment practices in the AI era.",

    "abstract": "We study the Euclidean Distance degree of algebraic neural network models from the perspective of algebraic geometry. Focusing on shallow networks with two neurons, quadratic activation, and scalar output, we identify the associated neurovariety with the second secant variety of a quadratic Veronese embedding. We introduce and analyze the virtual Euclidean Distance degree, a projective invariant defined as the sum of the polar degrees of the variety, which coincides with the usual Euclidean Distance degree for a generic choice of scalar product. Using intersection theory, Chern-Mather classes, and the Nash blow-up provided by Kempf's resolution, we reduce the computation of the virtual Euclidean Distance degree to explicit intersection numbers on a Grassmannian. Applying equivariant localization, we prove that this invariant depends stably polynomially on the input dimension. Numerical experiments based on homotopy continuation illustrate the dependence of the Euclidean Distance degree on the chosen metric and highlight the distinction between the generic and nongeneric cases, such as the Bombieri-Weyl metric.",

Let $\\mathcal{M}$ be a semifinite von Neumann algebra (or an atomic von Neumann algebra with all atoms having the same trace) acting on a separable Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$ equipped with a semifinite faithful normal trace $\u03c4$. We show that for any noncommutative symmetric space corresponding to a symmetric function space $E(0,\\infty)$ in the sense of Lindenstrauss--Tzafriri such that $\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_E\\ne \u03bb\\left\\|\\cdot\\right\\|_{L_2}$, $\u03bb\\in \\mathbb{R}_+$, any isometry on $E(\\mathcal{M},\u03c4)$ is of elementary form.

Z. 1989], while the case of separable symmetric function spaces was treated in\n  [Huang \\& Sukochev, JEMS, 2024]. As an application, we obtain a noncommutative Kalton--Randrianantoanina--Zaidenberg Theorem, providing a characterization of noncommutative $L_p$-spaces over finite von Neumann algebras and a necessary and sufficient condition for an operator on a noncommutative symmetric space to be an isometry. Having this at hand, we answer a question posed by Mityagin in 1970 [Uspehi Mat.

It is also shown that any noncommutative $L_p$-space, $1\\le p<\\infty$, affiliated with an atomless semifinite von Neumann algebra has a unique symmetric structure up to isometries.

The resulting linear feature extractor adopts a closed form in terms of the first $d$ eigenvectors of a known matrix.

First, in the setting of semilinear elliptic PDEs, we introduce a refined variational truncation method that yields infinite sequences of positive as well as negative solutions. Second and most notably, we resolve a long-standing and difficult problem for nonvariational elliptic PDEs with gradient dependence. By combining our truncation method with an iterative scheme, we prove, for the first time, the existence of infinitely many solutions for this class of PDEs. Third, we overcome a central difficulty for periodic Hamiltonian systems on the real line: we show that the multiplicity of solutions, constructed on a sequence of finite intervals, survives in the limit; in other words, no collapse occurs, and we obtain multiple distinct solutions on the whole real line.\n  The core novelty lies in a carefully designed truncation methodology that systematically separates solutions and remains effective across variational and non-variational PDEs as well as infinite dimensional dynamical systems. This unified perspective provides a robust and versatile tool for addressing multiplicity problems in the absence of symmetry.",

The optimal communication cost is simply given by the entropy of the hypergraph (within a logarithmic gap).

    "abstract": "This paper is concerned with performance analysis and pole selection problem in identifying linear time-invariant (LTI) systems using orthogonal basis functions (OBFs), a system identification approach that consists of solving least-squares problems and selecting poles within the OBFs. Specifically, we analyze the convergence properties and asymptotic bias of the OBF algorithm, and propose a pole selection algorithm that robustly minimizes the worst-case identification bias, with the bias measured under the $\\mathcal{H}_2$ error criterion. Our results include an analytical expression for the convergence rate and an explicit bound on the asymptotic identification bias, which depends on both the true system poles and the preselected model poles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the pole selection algorithm is asymptotically optimal, achieving the fundamental lower bound on the identification bias. The algorithm explicitly determines the model poles as the so-called Tsuji points, and the asymptotic identification bias decreases exponentially with the number of basis functions, with the rate of decrease governed by the hyperbolic Chebyshev constant. Numerical experiments validate the derived bounds and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed pole selection algorithm.",

This decomposition defines shear parameters on edges and radius parameters at the singularities, and yields global coordinates on $\\mathcal{T}(G)$: the resulting shear-radius map is a homeomorphism onto an explicit open cone in a finite-dimensional real vector space. In the spirit of Thurston, we then introduce partial stretch and anti-stretch deformations by rescaling the transverse measures of the interior or peripheral components. Peripheral stretch rays converge, in the simple-curve length-spectrum topology, to the cusped hyperbolic metric determined by the shear data, while interior anti-stretch rays converge to a circle-packed hyperbolic cone metric determined by the radii.

This scenario arises in machine learning when the dataset size is small with respect to the model, and is typically referred to as overparametrization. Our main result relates the degenerate optimization problem to a nondegenerate one via a projection. In the highly-degenerate regime, we find that a central role is played by the ramification locus of the projection. Additionally, we provide tools for counting the number of critical points over projective varieties, and discuss specific cases arising from deep learning. Our work bridges tools from algebraic geometry with ideas from machine learning, and it extends the line of literature around the Euclidean distance degree to the degenerate setting.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses ways to categorify chromatic, dichromatic and Penrose polynomials, including categorifications of integer evaluations of chromatic polynomials.\n  We show that with an appropriate choice of variables the coefficients of the Potts partition function at different energy levels are given by Euler characteristics of appropriate parts of a bigraded homology theory associated with the model. In the case of the dichromatic polynomial for graphs, we show that the two variable polynomial can be seen as a sum of powers of one variable multiplied by coefficients that are \"impropriety\" coloring polynomials for the underlying graph. An impropriety polynomial $C_{G}^{i}(n)$ counts the number of colorings in $n$ colors of the graph that are not proper at a given number $i$ of edges in the graph. The last section of the paper categorifies coloring evaluations rather than coloring polynomials. We then obtain a range of possible chain complexes and homology theories such that the chromatic evaluation is equal to the Euler characteristic of the homology. The freedom of choice in making such chain complexes is related to possible associative algebra structures on the set of colors.",

    "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI)-native three-dimensional (3D) spectrum maps are crucial in spectrum monitoring for intelligent communication networks. However, it is challenging to obtain and transmit 3D spectrum maps in a spectrum-efficient, computation-efficient, and AI-driven manner, especially under complex communication environments and sparse sampling data. In this paper, we consider practical air-to-ground semantic communications for spectrum map completion, where the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measures the spectrum at spatial points and extracts the spectrum semantics, which are then utilized to complete spectrum maps at the ground device. Since statistical machine learning can easily be misled by superficial data correlations with the lack of interpretability, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced semantic spectrum map completion framework with two expert knowledge-driven constraints from physical signal propagation models. This framework can capture the real-world physics and avoid getting stuck in the mindset of superficial data distributions. Furthermore, a knowledge-enhanced vector-quantized Transformer (KE-VQ-Transformer) based multi-scale low-complex intelligent completion approach is proposed, where the sparse window is applied to avoid ultra-large 3D attention computation, and the multi-scale design improves the completion performance. The knowledge-enhanced mean square error (KMSE) and root KMSE (RKMSE) are introduced as novel metrics for semantic spectrum map completion that jointly consider the numerical precision and physical consistency with the signal propagation model, based on which a joint offline and online training method is developed with supervised and unsupervised knowledge loss. The simulation demonstrates that our proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art benchmark schemes in terms of RKMSE.",

    "abstract": "Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by constructing first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) objectives whose values are provably equivalent to the solution error in PDE-induced norms. We demonstrate this framework on stationary diffusion and linear elasticity, incorporating mixed Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions via variational lifts to preserve norm equivalence without inconsistent penalties. To ensure the function space conformity required by the FOSLS loss, we propose a Reduced Basis Neural Operator (RBNO). The RBNO predicts coefficients for a pre-computed, conforming reduced basis, thereby ensuring variational stability by design while enabling efficient training. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis that bounds the total error by the sum of finite element discretization bias, reduced basis truncation error, neural network approximation error, and statistical estimation errors arising from finite sampling and optimization. Numerical benchmarks validate these theoretical bounds and demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy in PDE-compliant norms compared to standard baselines, while the residual loss serves as a reliable, computable a posteriori error estimator.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a rigorous derivation and analysis of accelerated optimization algorithms through the lens of High-Resolution Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). While classical Nesterov acceleration is well-understood via asymptotic vanishing damping, the dynamics of Anderson Acceleration (AA) remain less transparent. This work makes significant theoretical contributions to AA by bridging discrete acceleration algorithms with continuous dynamical systems, while also providing practical algorithmic innovations. Our work addresses fundamental questions about the physical nature of Anderson Acceleration that have remained unanswered since its introduction in 1965. Firstly, we prove that AA can be exactly rewritten as an adaptive momentum method and, in the high-resolution limit, converges to a second-order ODE with Variable Effective Mass. Through a Lyapunov energy analysis, we reveal the specific instability mechanism of standard AA: unchecked growth in effective mass acts as negative damping, physically injecting energy into the system and violating dissipation constraints. Conversely, high-resolution analysis identifies an implicit Hessian-driven damping term that provides stabilization in stiff regimes. Leveraging these dynamical insights, we then propose Energy-Guarded Anderson Acceleration (EG-AA), an algorithm that acts as an inertial governor to enforce thermodynamic consistency. Morevoer, our convergence analysis, formulated via the Acceleration Gain Factor, proves that EG-AA improves upon gradient descent by maximizing the geometric contraction of the linear subspace projection while actively suppressing nonlinear approximation errors. Theoretical bounds confirm that EG-AA is no worse than standard AA, and numerical experiments demonstrate strictly improved convergence stability and rates in ill-conditioned convex composite problems compared to standard Anderson mixing.",

The first class is contained in the class of theories of $\u03c9$-stable first-order reducts of finitely homogeneous relational structures, which was studied by Lachlan in the 80's.

    "abstract": "This work systematically investigates the performance of FORCE--$\u03b1$ numerical fluxes within an arbitrary high order semidiscrete finite volume (FV) framework for hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Such numerical fluxes have been recently introduced by Toro, Saggiorato, Tokareva, and Hidalgo (Journal of Computational Physics, 416, 2020), and constitute a family of centred fluxes obtained from a suitable modification of First--Order Centred (FORCE) numerical fluxes. In contrast with upwind fluxes, such as Rusanov, Harten--Lax--van Leer (HLL) or the exact Riemann solver (RS) numerical flux, centred ones do not consider in any way the structure of the Riemann problem at cell interfaces. Adopting centred numerical fluxes leads to a high level of flexibility of the resulting numerical schemes, for example in the context of complicated hyperbolic systems, for which RSs may be impossible to construct or computationally expensive.\n  The baseline framework adopted in this investigation is a FV semidiscrete approach with Weighted Essentially Non--Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization, and results are reported up to order 7. Previous investigations involving the same framework have established that increasing the order of accuracy tends to decrease the differences in the results obtained through different numerical fluxes. The goal of this paper is to show that the employment of FORCE--$\u03b1$ numerical fluxes within such a framework is a competitive alternative to the adoption of more classical upwind fluxes. The hyperbolic system considered for this investigation is the ideal Euler equations in one and two space dimensions.",

Using structural properties of the Prabhakar kernel and generalized Mittag-Leffler functions, we reduce the problem to a Volterra type integral equation. This reduction enables the explicit construction of the corresponding Green's function. Based on the obtained Green's function, we derive a closed-form integral representation of the solution and prove its existence and uniqueness. The results extend classical Green-function techniques to a wider class of fractional operators and provide analytical tools for further study of boundary and inverse problems associated with Prabhakar-type fractional differential equations.",

    "abstract": "We consider a random geometric graph obtained by placing a Poisson point process of intensity 1 in the d-dimensional torus of side length n^(1/d) and connecting two points by an edge if their distance is at most r. We consider the case of d>=2 and r in [r_min, r_max], where r_min<r_max are any constants with r_min>r_g and r_g is a constant above which this graph has a giant component with high probability. We show that, with high probability, the mixing time and the relaxation time of the simple random walk on the giant component in this case are both of order n^(2/d) and that therefore there is no cutoff. We also obtain bounds for the isoperimetric profile of subsets of the giant component of at least polylogarithmic size.",

In a general class of models asymptotic completeness holds provided the expectation value of the photon number $N$ remains bounded uniformly in time. This has been established by Faupin and Sigal. We review and simplify their work, and, more importantly, we replace the bound on $N$ by a weaker assumption on the distribution of $N$ that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic completeness.",

A specific case, known as a $(0,1)$-regular set, is referred to as a perfect code. In this paper, we will delve into $(r,s)$-regular sets in the context of vertex-transitive graphs. It is noteworthy that any vertex-transitive graph can be represented as a coset graph \\( \\Cos(G,H,U) \\). When examining a group \\( G \\) and a subgroup \\( H \\) of \\( G \\), a subgroup \\( A \\) that encompasses \\( H \\) is identified as an $(r,s)$-regular set related to the pair \\( (G,H) \\) if there exists a coset graph \\( \\Cos(G,H,U) \\) such that the set of left cosets of \\( H \\) in \\( A \\) forms an $(r,s)$-regular set within this graph. In this paper, we present both a necessary and sufficient condition for determining when a normal subgroup \\( A \\) that includes \\( H \\) as a normal subgroup qualifies as an $(r,s)$-regular set for the pair \\( (G,H) \\). Furthermore, if \\( A \\) is a normal subgroup of \\( G \\) containing \\( H \\), we establish a relationship between \\( A \\) being a perfect code of \\( (G,H) \\) and the quotient \\( N_A(H)/H \\) being a perfect code of \\(( N_G(H)/H, {1_{N_{G}(H)/H}}) \\).",

When the observations happen to have the same conditional mean, our CS is asymptotically tighter than the recent closed-form CS of Waudby-Smith and Ramdas [38]. It also has other desirable properties: it is centered at the unweighted sample mean and has limiting width (multiplied by $\\sqrt{t/\\log t}$) independent of the significance level.

An exploratory kinematic study of such surfaces could be very valuable, especially if conducted with no use of coordinates. Three energy contents have been identified in a thin shell, which refer to three independent deformation modes: stretching, drilling, and bending. We analyze the consequences for the three energy contents produced by metric restrictions imposed on the admissible deformations. Would the latter stem from physical constraints, the elastic response of a shell could be hindered in ways that might not be readily expected.",

    "abstract": "Lorentzian and completely log-concave polynomials have recently emerged as a unifying framework for negative dependence, log-concavity, and convexity in combinatorics and probability. We extend this theory to variational analysis and cone-constrained dynamics by studying $K$-Lorentzian and $K$-completely log-concave polynomials over a proper convex cone $K\\subset\\mathbb{R}^n$. For a $K$-Lorentzian form $f$ and $v\\in\\operatorname{int}K$, we define an open cone $K^\\circ(f,v)$ and a closed cone $K(f,v)$ via directional derivatives along $v$, recovering the usual hyperbolicity cone when $f$ is hyperbolic. We prove that $K^\\circ(f,v)$ is a proper cone and equals $\\operatorname{int}K(f,v)$. If $f$ is $K(f,v)$-Lorentzian, then $K(f,v)$ is convex and maximal among convex cones on which $f$ is Lorentzian.\n  Using the Rayleigh matrix $M_f(x)=\\nabla f(x)\\nabla f(x)^T - f(x)\\nabla^2 f(x)$, we obtain cone-restricted Rayleigh inequalities and show that two-direction Rayleigh inequalities on $K$ are equivalent to an acuteness condition for the bilinear form $v^T M_f(x) w$. This yields a cone-restricted negative-dependence interpretation linking the curvature of $\\log f$ to covariance properties of associated Gibbs measures. For determinantal generating polynomials, we identify the intersection of the hyperbolicity cone with the nonnegative orthant as the classical semipositive cone, and we extend this construction to general proper cones via $K$-semipositive cones. Finally, for linear evolution variational inequality (LEVI) systems, we show that if $q(x)=x^T A x$ is (strictly) $K$-Lorentzian, then $A$ is (strictly) $K$-copositive and yields Lyapunov (semi-)stability on $K$, giving new Lyapunov criteria for cone-constrained dynamics.",
