    "title": "On Linear Convergence of Distributed Stochastic Bilevel Optimization over Undirected Networks via Gradient Aggregation",
    "abstract": "Many large-scale constrained optimization problems can be formulated as bilevel distributed optimization tasks over undirected networks, where agents collaborate to minimize a global cost function while adhering to constraints, relying only on local communication and computation. In this work, we propose a distributed stochastic gradient aggregation scheme and establish its linear convergence under the weak assumption of global strong convexity, which relaxes the common requirement of local function convexity on the objective and constraint functions. Specifically, we prove that the algorithm converges at a linear rate when the global objective function (and not each local objective function) satisfies strong-convexity. Our results significantly extend existing theoretical guarantees for distributed bilevel optimization. Additionally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments on distributed sensor network problems and distributed linear regression with rank-deficient data.",

    "title": "A note on two Collatz evolution flows",
    "abstract": "Two evolution models based on the generalized Collatz operator are introduced. These models are characterized by coefficients $\u03b1$ and $\u03b2$ in the Collatz dynamics, and are suitably defined. Here, $\u03b1=\u03b2=1$, and $\u03b1=3$, $\u03b2=1$ correspond to the Nollatz and classical Collatz operators, respectively. In general, the first evolution model is a continuum, Fourier side based, motivated by the Cubic Szeg\u0151 operator of G\u00e9rard and Grellier. The second evolution considers discrete time derivatives of the Collatz orbits. In this paper we describe the evolution of both models, with particular emphasis on dynamical properties. For the first one, it is proved local and global existence in the space $L^2(\\mathbb T)$, and a one-to-one characterization of the existence of nontrivial periodic and unbounded orbits of the Collatz mapping in terms of particular set of solutions of this continuous Collatz flow. For the discrete part, a sort of discrete energy is introduced. This energy has the property of being conserved by the discrete flow. An estimate of each term in this energy is given, proving suitable growth bounds. Finally, the meaning of the discrete time derivative for the generalized Collatz orbits is discussed. It is proved that, except for the Nollatz and Collatz operators, the sum of coefficients related to this discrete time derivative is an increasing sequence in $n$ as the iteration parameter $n$ evolves.",

    "abstract": "We consider the continuum limit of some products of random matrices in $\\text{SL}(d,{\\mathbb R})$ that arise as discretisations of incompressible renewing flows -- that is, of flows corresponding to a divergence-free velocity field that takes independent, identically-distributed values in successive time intervals of duration proportional to $\u03c4$. The statistical properties of the product are encoded in its generalised Lyapunov exponent whose computation reduces to finding the leading eigenvalue of a certain transfer operator. In the continuum (Kraichnan--Kazantsev) limit obtained by neglecting the terms of order $o(\u03c4^2)$, the transfer operator becomes a partial differential operator and, for a certain type of disorder which we call ``symmetric'', some calculations are feasible. For $d=2$, we compute the growth rate of the product in terms of complete elliptic integrals. By letting the elliptic modulus vary, we obtain a spectral problem, corresponding to a modulus-dependent random renewing flow, which may be viewed as a perturbation of the spectral problem for the angular Laplacian. In this way, we deduce expansions for the generalised Lyapunov exponent in ascending powers of the modulus. These expansions generalise to the case $d \\ge 2$, and we compute the first few terms explicitly for $d \\in \\{2,3\\}$.",

    "title": "Function-Correcting Codes With Data Protection",
    "abstract": "Function-correcting codes (FCCs) are designed to provide error protection for the value of a function computed on the data. Existing work typically focuses solely on protecting the function value and not the underlying data. In this work, we propose a general framework that offers protection for both the data and the function values. Since protecting the data inherently contributes to protecting the function value, we focus on scenarios where the function value requires stronger protection than the data itself. We first introduce a more general approach and a framework for function-correcting codes that incorporates data protection along with protection of function values. A two-step construction procedure for such codes is proposed, and bounds on the optimal redundancy of general FCCs with data protection are reported. Using these results, we exhibit examples that show that data protection can be added to existing FCCs without increasing redundancy. Using our two-step construction procedure, we present explicit constructions of FCCs with data protection for specific families of functions, such as locally bounded functions and the Hamming weight function. We associate a graph called minimum-distance graph to a code and use it to show that perfect codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes cannot provide additional protection to function values over and above the amount of protection for data for any function. Then we focus on linear FCCs and provide some results for linear functions, leveraging their inherent structural properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of FCCs with a linear structure. Finally, we generalize the Plotkin and Hamming bounds well known in classical error-correcting coding theory to FCCs with data protection.",

While prior research has mainly focused on linear VAR models, these approaches can be restrictive in practice. To address this, we introduce a high-dimensional non-parametric sparse additive model, providing a more flexible framework. Our method employs basis expansions to construct high-dimensional nonlinear VAR models. We derive convergence rates and model selection consistency for least squared estimators, considering dependence measures of the processes, error moment conditions, sparsity, and basis expansions. Our theory significantly extends prior linear VAR models by incorporating both non-Gaussianity and non-linearity. As a key contribution, we derive sharp Bernstein-type inequalities for tail probabilities in both non-sub-Gaussian linear and nonlinear VAR processes, which match the classical Bernstein inequality for independent random variables. Additionally, we present numerical experiments that support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the advantages of the nonlinear VAR model for a gene expression time series dataset.",

This new stability assumption, together with a symmetry property of the system, allows us to derive an exponential turnpike property for those solutions that are close to the stationary one.

    "abstract": "Decision trees are a popular machine learning model which are traditionally trained by heuristic methods. Massive improvements in computing power and optimisation techniques has led to renewed interest in learning globally optimal decision trees. Empirical evidence shows that optimal classification trees (OCTs) have better out-of-sample performance than heuristic methods. The dominant optimisation paradigms for training OCTs are mixed-integer programming (MIP) and dynamic programming (DP). MIP formulations offer flexibility in the objectives and constraints that are modelled, but suffer from poor scaling in the size of the training dataset and the maximum tree depth. DP models represent the state of the art in scaling for OCTs, but lack some of the flexibility of MIP models. In this paper we present progress on using advanced integer programming methods to integrate ideas from DP models into MIP formulations to begin bridging the scaling gap. Using the existing BendOCT model from the literature as a base model, we introduce valid inequalities, cutting planes, and a primal heuristic to improve the scaling of MIP formulations. We show that these techniques significantly improve the ability of BendOCT to find provably optimal solutions over a wide range of datasets.",

    "abstract": "We study isometric immersions of a Riemannian surface $(\\W,\\g)$, where $\\W\\subset \\R^2$, into $\\R^3$. We consider their bending energy, i.e., the square of the $L^2$-norm of their second fundamental form, which is equivalent to the Willmore functional. We obtain two new lower bounds for this energy, one in terms of the Gaussian curvature of the surface, and the other in terms of a Burgers vector -- a measure of non-flatness connected to torsion. These new estimates provide optimal blowup rates of the energy when the curvature is concentrated (e.g., in a conical geometry). In the more subtle case of dipoles of concentrated curvature, we use the Burgers vector estimates to obtain an optimal blowup rate in terms of the size of the system. Our motivation comes from non-Euclidean elasticity, in which cones and curvature-dipoles play a central role. The lower bounds derived in this work directly yield lower bounds for the elastic energy of thin elastic sheets. The derivation of the curvature-based lower bound involves an isoperimetric inequality for framed loops, which we believe to be of independent interest.",

Within the framework of time-frequency analysis, we derive\n  explicit expressions for the Wigner kernels of Fourier multipliers and establish quantitative\n  decay estimates for the corresponding Gabor matrices. These results are obtained under symbol\n  regularity conditions formulated in the Gelfand-Shilov scale and ensure exponential off-diagonal\n  decay or quasi-diagonality of the matrix representation. We believe this approach can be extended to more general symbols in the pseudodifferential setting, improving the existing results in terms of their Gabor matrix decay. For the complex heat equation, we obtain closed-form formulas exhibiting both dissipative\n  and oscillatory behavior governed respectively by the real and imaginary parts of the diffusion\n  parameter. The modulus of the Gabor matrix is shown to display Gaussian decay and temporal\n  spreading consistent with diffusion phenomena. In contrast, the complex Hermite equation\n  is analyzed via H\u00f6rmander's metaplectic semigroup, where the propagator decomposes as the product\n  of a real Hermite semigroup and a fractional Fourier transform. In this setting, the Gabor matrix\n  retains its Gaussian shape while undergoing a pure rotation on the time-frequency plane,\n  reflecting the symplectic structure of the underlying flow.\n  The analysis provides a unified operator-theoretic and phase-space perspective on parabolic\n  and hyperbolic evolution equations, linking the geometry of their symbols with the\n  sparsity and localization properties of their Gabor representations.

    "abstract": "Binary semirings such as the tropical, log, and probability semirings form a core algebraic tool in classical and modern neural inference systems, supporting tasks like Viterbi decoding, dynamic programming, and probabilistic reasoning. However, these structures rely on a binary multiplication operator and therefore model only pairwise interactions. Many symbolic AI tasks are inherently triadic, including subject-predicate-object relations in knowledge graphs, logical rules involving two premises and one conclusion, and multi-entity dependencies in structured decision processes. Existing neural architectures usually approximate these interactions by flattening or factorizing them into binary components, which weakens inductive structure, distorts relational meaning, and reduces interpretability.\n  This paper introduces the Neural Ternary Semiring (NTS), a learnable and differentiable algebraic framework grounded in the theory of ternary Gamma-semirings. The central idea is to replace the usual binary product with a native ternary operator implemented by neural networks and guided by algebraic regularizers enforcing approximate associativity and distributivity. This construction allows triadic relationships to be represented directly rather than reconstructed from binary interactions.\n  We establish a soundness result showing that, when algebraic violations vanish during training, the learned operator converges to a valid ternary Gamma-semiring. We also outline an evaluation strategy for triadic reasoning tasks such as knowledge-graph completion and rule-based inference. These insights demonstrate that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a mathematically principled and practically effective foundation for learnable symbolic reasoning.",

    "abstract": "We study evolutionary dynamics on graphs in which each step consists of one birth and one death, also known as the Moran processes. There are two types of individuals: residents with fitness $1$ and mutants with fitness $r$. Two standard update rules are used in the literature. In Birth-death (Bd), a vertex is chosen to reproduce proportional to fitness, and one of its neighbors is selected uniformly at random to be replaced by the offspring. In death-Birth (dB), a vertex is chosen uniformly to die, and then one of its neighbors is chosen, proportional to fitness, to place an offspring into the vacancy. We formalize and study a unified model, the $\u03bb$-mixed Moran process, in which each step is independently a Bd step with probability $\u03bb\\in [0,1]$ and a dB step otherwise. We analyze this mixed process for undirected, connected graphs. As an interesting special case, we show at $\u03bb=1/2$, for any graph that the fixation probability when $r=1$ with a single mutant initially on the graph is exactly $1/n$, and also at $\u03bb=1/2$ that the absorption time for any $r$ is $O_r(n^4)$. We also show results for graphs that are \"almost regular,\" in a manner defined in the paper. We use this to show that for suitable random graphs from $G \\sim G(n,p)$ and fixed $r>1$, with high probability over the choice of graph, the absorption time is $O_r(n^4)$, the fixation probability is $\u03a9_r(n^{-2})$, and we can approximate the fixation probability in polynomial time. Another special case is when the graph has only two distinct degree values $\\{d_1, d_2\\}$ with $d_1 \\leq d_2$. For those graphs, we give exact formulas for fixation probabilities when $r = 1$ and any $\u03bb$, and establish an absorption time of $O_r(n^4 \u03b1^4)$ for all $\u03bb$, where $\u03b1= d_2 / d_1$.

    "abstract": "A dynamic linear thermo-poroelasticity model, containing inertial and relaxation terms with second-order time derivatives, is investigated in this paper. The mathematical and numerical analysis of this model is performed in the frequency domain. The variational formulation is analyzed within the framework of Fredholm's alternative and T-coercivity. Under appropriate assumptions on the coefficients, the well-posedness of the problem is proved. For its discretization, we propose a stabilized coupling of conforming and mixed finite element spaces, which are free of volumetric locking, and both, pressure as well as temperature oscillations. By incorporating projections in certain sesquilinear forms, the well-posedness of the finite element solution can be obtained through a similar reasoning as in the continuous case. Optimal error estimates are derived for all variables. Numerical studies validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.",

As a consequence, we obtain the Bogomolov property for totally $p$-adic points of an abelian variety $A/\\mathbb{Q}$ in the case when $A$ has good reduction at $p$.

    "title": "A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Resource Allocation in Uplink Carrier Aggregation in the Presence of Self Interference",
    "abstract": "Carrier aggregation (CA) is a technique that allows mobile networks to combine multiple carriers to increase user data rate. On the uplink, for power constrained users, this translates to the need for an efficient resource allocation scheme, where each user distributes its available power among its assigned uplink carriers. Choosing a good set of carriers and allocating appropriate power on the carriers is important. If the carrier allocation on the uplink is such that a harmonic of a user's uplink carrier falls on the downlink frequency of that user, it leads to a self coupling-induced sensitivity degradation of that user's downlink receiver. In this paper, we model the uplink carrier aggregation problem as an optimal resource allocation problem with the associated constraints of non-linearities induced self interference (SI). This involves optimization over a discrete variable (which carriers need to be turned on) and a continuous variable (what power needs to be allocated on the selected carriers) in dynamic environments, a problem which is hard to solve using traditional methods owing to the mixed nature of the optimization variables and the additional need to consider the SI constraint. We adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) framework involving a compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for the uplink carrier aggregation problem. We propose a novel reward function that is critical for enabling the proposed CA2C algorithm to efficiently handle SI. The CA2C algorithm along with the proposed reward function learns to assign and activate suitable carriers in an online fashion. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed RL based scheme is able to achieve higher sum throughputs compared to naive schemes. The results also demonstrate that the proposed reward function allows the CA2C algorithm to adapt the optimization both in the presence and absence of SI.",

    "abstract": "Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) is an emerging technology in massive access designed to meet the demands of future wireless communication networks by naturally mitigating multiuser interference through the utilization of the fluid antenna system (FAS) at RF-chain-limited mobile device. The transition from single-active-port to multi-active-port on a shared RF chain for slow FAMA can greatly enhance its multiplexing capability but is not well understood. Motivated by this, this paper proposes and studies three port selection methods: the optimal exhaustive-search port selection (EPS) as a performance upper bound, and two suboptimal, low-complexity algorithms, namely incremental port selection (IPS) and decremental port selection (DPS). Then the performance of multi-active-port slow FAMA is analyzed, and the complexity of the proposed methods is compared. Simulation results indicate that the proposed methods outperform current state-of-the-art multi-port FAMA techniques. In particular, IPS achieves near-optimal performance while maintaining manageable computational complexity. This research provides a more general framework for port selection in FAMA systems.",

This research addresses this critical gap by developing a large-scale, calibrated agent-based model for supplier selection, complemented by a probabilistic heuristic for international shipments. Our approach integrates trade relationships between industry sectors, transportation costs, and supplier rating model adapted from existing literature. The model's core objective is to minimize the discrepancy between modeled and observed commodity flows while ensuring a close match to regional shipping distance distributions. Implemented and tested across four major U.S. metropolitan areas, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Los Angeles, the model demonstrates high fidelity in replicating observed freight patterns. Key findings reveal consistent alignment with national shipping distance trends and highlight significant spatial variations in commodity trade assignments and demand across the study regions. This behaviorally informed and transport-sensitive framework is designed to approximate real-world decision-making, providing a robust tool for policymakers and planners to evaluate targeted interventions, assess infrastructure investments, and enhance supply chain resilience in the face of disruptions.",

    "abstract": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds defined by randomly sampled point clouds is a challenging problem in scientific computing and has broad applications in various fields. In this paper, we develop a two-step generalized radial basis function-generated finite difference (gRBF-FD) method for solving PDEs on manifolds without boundaries, identified by randomly sampled point cloud data. The gRBF-FD is based on polyharmonic spline kernels and multivariate polynomials (PHS+Poly) defined over the tangent space in a local Monge coordinate system. The first step is to regress the local target function using a generalized moving least squares (GMLS) while the second step is to compensate for the residual using a PHS interpolation. Our gRBF-FD method has the same interpolant form with the standard RBF-FD but differs in interpolation coefficients. Our approach utilizes a specific weight function in both the GMLS and PHS steps and implements an automatic tuning strategy for the stencil size K (i.e., the number of nearest neighbors) at each point. These strategies are designed to produce a Laplacian matrix with a specific coefficient structure, thereby enhancing stability and reducing the solution error. We establish an error bound for the operator approximation in terms of the so-called local stencil diameter as well as in terms of the number of data. We further demonstrate the high accuracy of gRBF-FD through numerical tests on various smooth manifolds.",

Owing to the fuzziness of membership degrees, T2 FSs can better model the uncertainty of real life, and thus, type-2 rule-based fuzzy systems (T2 RFSs) become hot research topics in recent decades. In T2 RFS, the compositional rule of inference is based on triangular norms (t-norms) defined on complete lattice (L, \\le ) ( L is the set of all convex normal functions from [0,1] to [0,1], and , \\le is the so-called convolution order). Hence, the choice of t-norm on (L,\\le) may influence the performance of T2 RFS. Therefore, it is significant to broad the set of t-norms among which domain experts can choose most suitable one. To construct t-norms on (L,\\le), the mainstream method is convolution which is induced by two operators on the unit interval [0,1]. A key problem appears naturally, when convolution is a t-norm on (L,\\le). This paper gives the necessary and sufficient conditions under which convolution is a t-norm on (L,\\le). Moreover, note that the computational complexity of operators prevent the application of T2 RFSs. This paper also provides one kind of convolutions which are t-norms on (L,\\le) and extremely easy to calculate.",

We also present analogous results for Steiner 3-chains and give an application of our results to the feasibility problem for the radii of Steiner 4-chains.\n  Keywords: Steiner chain, parent circles, Steiner porism, poristic Steiner chains, Descartes circle theorem, invariant moments of curvatures, algebraic relations between invariants",

    "title": "The Strict 2-Category Structure of Distorted Monoidal Categories",
    "abstract": "This paper introduces the concept of distorted monoidal categories, a generalization of monoidal and braided monoidal categories that supports non-reversible and direction-sensitive tensor structures. Unlike the classical setting, where the braiding symmetry is required to be invertible, distorted monoidal categories admit non-invertible binary distortions and unit distortions while preserving coherent tensorial reasoning. We show that these structures naturally assemble into a strict 2-category whose composition and interchange laws hold on the nose, not merely up to isomorphism. Beyond the abstract 2-monad justification, our contribution is a fully constructive and type-safe calculus that enables formal reasoning about non-invertible interchange. We provide explicit construction schemes for such distortions, including idempotent twists of classical braidings and graded unit distortions arising from characters on monoidal gradings. This framework extends the expressive power of monoidal categories to model irreversible, resource-sensitive, and direction-dependent processes --such as those in directed homotopy theory, categorical quantum mechanics, and non-symmetric operadic structures--while remaining amenable to mechanization and formal verification.",

    "title": "Aerial Semantic Relay-Enabled SAGIN: Joint UAV Deployment and Resource Allocation",
    "abstract": "Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) are pivotal for enabling ubiquitous connectivity in 6G systems, yet they face significant challenges due to severe satellite-to-ground link impairments. Although Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can function as relay nodes to compensate for air-to-ground channel degradation, the satellite-to-UAV link remains a critical bottleneck. Semantic Communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising solution to enhance spectral efficiency by transmitting essential semantic information. This paper proposes a novel multi-cluster UAV-aided SAGIN SemCom architecture that supports both semantic users (SemUsers) and conventional users (ConUsers). While SemCom is employed in the satellite-to-UAV link to improve transmission efficiency, the UAVs implement an intelligent adaptive relay strategy, capable of either directly forwarding semantic data to SemUsers or converting it into bit-level data for ConUsers. Compared to existing similar schemes, this design guarantees the high-efficiency advantages of SemCom while enabling network access for larger coverage area. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the system's sum-rate through coordinated allocation of power, bandwidth, and UAV positions. To address this non-convex problem, we develop an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm, which decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline schemes in terms of both sum-rate and spectral efficiency across various channel conditions and user distributions, underscoring the importance of joint resource allocation and intelligent UAV deployment.",

As the complex evolves, new $k-1$-dimensional cycles are born and then at a later time they die, that is, they get filled in. The notion of persistence diagrams, which is a standard tool in topological data analysis, provides a way to record these birth and death times. In this paper, we understand the asymptotic behavior of the persistence diagrams of the above defined randomly evolving complexes as $n$ goes to infinity.\n  As the single time marginals of the above process are variants of the Linial-Meshulam complex, our results can be viewed as extensions of the results of Linial and Peled on the Betti numbers of the Linial-Meshulam complex.\n  Our proof relies on the notion of local weak convergence of graphs and a generalization of the results of Bordenave, Lelarge and Salez on the rank of sparse random matrices.",

The approximation scheme is based on a variant of the Chernoff product formula on the space of bounded continuous functions. In a first step, we provide sufficient and necessary conditions for arbitrary families of probability measures, indexed by positive real numbers, to give rise to a convolution semigroup via a Chernoff approximation on the space of bounded continuous functions, equipped with the mixed topology. In this context, we provide explicit criteria both for the convergence of subsequences and the entire family, and discuss fine properties related to the domain of the associated generator of the L\u00e9vy process and the infinitesimal behavior of the approximating family of measures. In a second step, we enrich the family of measures by a deterministic component and derive explicit conditions that ensure both the convergence of subsequences and the entire family to a L\u00e9vy process with drift under a Chernoff approximation. In a series of examples, we show that our general conditions on the dynamics are satisfied, for example, by flows of Lipschitz ordinary differential equations, Euler schemes, and arbitrary Runge-Kutta methods, and that the Central Limit Theorem can be subsumed under our framework.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a new class of error-correcting codes constructed from the ideal lattices of finite commutative ternary Gamma-semirings (TGS). Unlike classical linear or ring-linear codes, which rely on binary operations, TGS codes arise from the intrinsic ternary operation $[x,y,z]$ and the op-plus order that governs coordinatewise absorption. The fundamental parameters of a TGS code are determined by the $k$-ideal structure of the underlying semiring: the dimension is given by the index $|T/I|$, while the minimum distance depends on the minimal nonzero elements of the distributive ideal lattice $L(T)$. This leads to parameter sets that are not achievable over finite fields, group algebras, or standard semiring frameworks.\n  A quotient-based decoding method is developed in which the ternary syndrome $S(c) = Phi(c) + I$ lies in the quotient TGS $T/I$ and partitions the ambient space into cosets determined by ideal absorption. Minimal nonzero lattice elements yield canonical error representatives, producing a decoding procedure that resembles classical syndrome decoding but comes from higher-arity interactions. A concrete finite example illustrates the computation of parameters, the structure of syndrome classes, and the performance of the decoding method.\n  These results show that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a new algebraic foundation for nonlinear, nonbinary, and higher-arity coding theory. Their ideal-lattice structure and ternary quotient behavior generate new decoding mechanisms and error profiles, expanding algebraic coding theory beyond the limitations of classical linear systems.",

Individuals are either ignorants, spreaders, or stiflers; spreaders stop by contact with other spreaders or stiflers or after an independent random waiting time sampled from a given distribution, modeling a spontaneous loss of interest. The topology of the underlying population network is incorporated by modeling it as a broad class of symmetric networks, whose vertices are partitioned into finitely many orbit types. This yields a unified framework for homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. For sequences of finite quasi-transitive graphs, and for infinite quasi-transitive graphs with subexponential growth, we establish a Functional Law of Large Numbers and a Functional Central Limit Theorem for the densities of each vertex type for the three states. The mean-field limit is described by a system of nonlinear integral equations, while fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian and governed by a system of stochastic integral equations with explicit covariance. Our results show how the topology and the law of spontaneous stifling jointly shape the speed and variability of rumor outbreaks. As a special case, our model reduces to the classical Maki-Thompson model when spontaneous stifling is absent.",

Moreover, stable equivalences of centralizer matrix algebras over perfect fields induce stable equivalences of Morita type, thus preserve dominant, finitistic and global dimensions.

In this work, we consider a non-cooperative scenario where the receiver does not have prior knowledge of the OFDM parameters such as the number of subcarriers and the aim is to estimate them using the received data. Such a setup has applications in cognitive radio networks. For this blind OFDM parameter estimation problem, we provide a novel method based on eigen-spectral analysis of the covariance matrix corresponding to the received data. In particular, we show that the covariance matrix exhibits a distinctive rank property under correct segmentation of the received symbols, reflecting a characteristic behavior in its eigenvalue spectrum that facilitates accurate estimation of the number of subcarriers. The proposed method is more general than existing approaches in the literature, as it can detect an arbitrary number of subcarriers and its performance remains independent of the modulation scheme. The numerical results show that the proposed method accurately detects the number of subcarriers with high probability even at low SNR.",

The same conclusion holds when $G$ is the direct product of a dihedral group and the $2$-element group. On the other hand, the smallest non-abelian groups $G$ are found for which the separating Noether number over $K$ is strictly less than the Noether number over $K$. Along the way the exact value of the separating Noether number is determined for all groups of order at most $16$.

The case of primes $P\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ is analyzed, where two constructive types of solutions arise: ED1 (exactly one denominator divisible by $P$, namely $C=cP$) and ED2 (exactly two denominators divisible by $P$, namely $B=bP$ and $C=cP$). Parametric constructions and enumeration algorithms are developed, including explicit transitions between ED1 and ED2.\n  A deterministic algorithm is proposed, based on the intersection of a parametric lattice defined by pairs $(\u03b1,d')$ with bounded boxes. For each fixed prime $P\\equiv 1 \\pmod{5}$ the algorithm constructively produces a solution. Using analytic methods such as the Bombieri--Vinogradov theorem and the Chebotarev density theorem, it is shown that the density of admissible parameters is high, which yields polylogarithmic search complexity in the average case. A strict complexity guarantee for all primes remains conditional and depends on the finite covering hypothesis.\n  This study extends previous work for coefficient $4$ (the Erd\u0151s--Straus conjecture) to coefficient $5$, transferring the same structure of parametrization and constructive solutions.

    "abstract": "Type-2 fuzzy set (T2 FS) were introduced by Zadeh in 1965, and the membership degrees of T2 FSs are type-1 fuzzy sets (T1 FSs). Owing to the fuzziness of membership degrees, T2 FSs can better model the uncertainty of real life, and thus, type-2 rule-based fuzzy systems (T2 RFSs) become hot research topics in recent decades. In T2 RFS, the compositional rule of inference is based on triangular norms (t-norms) defined on complete lattice (L, \\le ) ( L is the set of all convex normal functions from [0,1] to [0,1], and , \\le is the so-called convolution order). Hence, the choice of t-norm on (L,\\le) may influence the performance of T2 RFS. Therefore, it is significant to broad the set of t-norms among which domain experts can choose most suitable one. To construct t-norms on (L,\\le), the mainstream method is convolution which is induced by two operators on the unit interval [0,1]. A key problem appears naturally, when convolution is a t-norm on (L,\\le). This paper gives the necessary and sufficient conditions under which convolution is a t-norm on (L,\\le). Moreover, note that the computational complexity of operators prevent the application of T2 RFSs. This paper also provides one kind of convolutions which are t-norms on (L,\\le) and extremely easy to calculate.",

Unlike the classical setting, where the braiding symmetry is required to be invertible, distorted monoidal categories admit non-invertible binary distortions and unit distortions while preserving coherent tensorial reasoning. We show that these structures naturally assemble into a strict 2-category whose composition and interchange laws hold on the nose, not merely up to isomorphism. Beyond the abstract 2-monad justification, our contribution is a fully constructive and type-safe calculus that enables formal reasoning about non-invertible interchange. We provide explicit construction schemes for such distortions, including idempotent twists of classical braidings and graded unit distortions arising from characters on monoidal gradings. This framework extends the expressive power of monoidal categories to model irreversible, resource-sensitive, and direction-dependent processes --such as those in directed homotopy theory, categorical quantum mechanics, and non-symmetric operadic structures--while remaining amenable to mechanization and formal verification.",

The first RIS (RIS$_1$), positioned near a fed antenna or access point, passively reflects the incident signal. RIS$_2$, equipped with a lightweight controller, performs bit-driven spatial modulation to enable data-dependent direction selection at the physical layer. We develop a complete end-to-end system model, including multi-hop channel representation, RIS phase configuration mapping, and signal detection based on space shift keying (SSK).

As the first theoretical result, we provide non-asymptotic guarantees on the false positive error incurred by the algorithm for attacks that are 2-step honest, referring to adversaries that act intermittently rather than successively. Moreover, we establish that for adversaries possessing a certain minimum energy, the false negative error incurred by AD-CPS is low.

At this respect, the most convenient mutual sphere-plane position has been object of a long debate, an account of which can be found in \\cite{Albouy2013}. This fascinating topic, resumed %subject, firstly by A. Albouy in the aforementioned paper, has been expanded from the theoretical side in \\cite{Albouy2015}. Further investigations recently appeared in \\cite{AlbouyZhao2019, Zhao1, TakeuchiZhao1, TakeuchiZhao2}. As remarked in \\cite{Albouy2013, Albouy2015}, extensions of the procedure to more dynamical systems would open to the possibility of finding first integrals to a given dynamical system simply looking at the energy of the mirror problem. In this note, we focus on the case of the problem of two fixed centers, already mentioned in \\cite{Albouy2013}. We provide a{n explicit} geometrical construction allowing to interpret the first integral of the problem as the energy of its projection on an ellipsoid. Compared to previous papers on the same subject, ours -- besides being based on a somehow different construction -- includes complete explicit computations. {A byproduct of our construction is the existence of two integrable mirror problems (equivalently, three quadratic integrals, including the energy) for the Kepler problem, which is an aspect of its super-integrability.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of matching correlated VAR time series databases, where a multivariate time series is observed along with a perturbed and permuted version, and the goal is to recover the unknown matching between them. To model this, we introduce a probabilistic framework in which two time series $(x_t)_{t\\in[T]},(x^\\#_t)_{t\\in[T]}$ are jointly generated, such that $x^\\#_t=x_{\u03c0^*(t)}+\u03c3\\tilde{x}_{\u03c0^*(t)}$, where $(x_t)_{t\\in[T]},(\\tilde{x}_t)_{t\\in[T]}$ are independent and identically distributed vector autoregressive (VAR) time series of order $1$ with Gaussian increments, for a hidden $\u03c0^*$. The objective is to recover $\u03c0^*$, from the observation of $(x_t)_{t\\in[T]},(x^\\#_t)_{t\\in[T]}$. This generalizes the classical problem of matching independent point clouds to the time series setting.\n  We derive the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), leading to a quadratic optimization over permutations, and theoretically analyze an estimator based on linear assignment. For the latter approach, we establish recovery guarantees, identifying thresholds for $\u03c3$ that allow for perfect or partial recovery. Additionally, we propose solving the MLE by considering convex relaxations of the set of permutation matrices (e.g., over the Birkhoff polytope). This allows for efficient estimation of $\u03c0^*$ and the VAR parameters via alternating minimization. Empirically, we find that linear assignment often matches or outperforms MLE relaxation based approaches.",

    "abstract": "The ultimate independence ratio of a graph $G$ is defined as $\\mathscr{I}(G) = \\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty } \\frac{\u03b1(G^{\\Box k})}{|V(G)|^k},$ where $\u03b1(G^{\\Box k})$ is the independence number of the Cartesian product of $k$ copies of $G$. For all graphs $G$, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak (1995) proved that $\\frac{1}{\u03c7(G)} \\leq \\mathscr{I}(G) \\leq \\frac{1}{\u03c9(G)}$ where $\u03c7(G)$ is the chromatic number, and $\u03c9(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. So all graphs $G$ with $\u03c7(G) = \u03c9(G)$ satisfy $\\mathscr{I}(G) = \\frac{1}{\u03c7(G)} = \\frac{1}{\u03c9(G)}$. A construction of Zhu demonstrates that there exists a graph $G$ with $\\frac{1}{\u03c7(G)} < \\mathscr{I}(G) < \\frac{1}{\u03c9(G)}$, so neither equality holds in general. In response, Hahn, Hell, and Poljak conjectured that all wheel graphs $W_n$ satisfy $\\mathscr{I}(W_n) = \\frac{1}{\u03c7(W_n)}$.\n  For even wheels $W_{2t}$ this follows from the fact $\u03c7(W_{2t}) = \u03c9(W_{2t}) = 3$. Odd wheels of length at least $5$ present a more challenging case, since $\u03c7(W_{2t+1}) = 4$ and $\u03c9(W_{2t+1}) = 3$. First, we prove that odd wheels of length at least $7$ satisfy $\\mathscr{I}(W_{2t+1})\\leq \\frac{4t^2+6t}{3(2t+2)^2}<\\frac{1}{3}$, which provides the best upper bound for large odd wheels. Next, we prove that $\\mathscr{I}(W_5) \\leq \\frac{1019}{3888}$, improving an upper bound of Hahn, Hell, and Poljak that $\\mathscr{I}(W_5) \\leq \\frac{11}{41}$.

This extends the semigroup-fication procedure introduced by Bracci and Roth to non-univalent functions. We use our technique in order to obtain sharp estimates for the rate with which the orbits of $f$ converge to the attracting fixed point; a fundamental, yet underdeveloped, concept in discrete iteration.

The first main contribution of this work is the derivation of an inhomogeneous Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality adapted to the unbounded weight, which provides the necessary control over the nonlinear term in terms of Sobolev norms. Building on this inequality, we then investigate the long-time behavior of solutions and establish a sharp dichotomy: solutions with initial data below the ground state energy either exist globally in time or experience finite-time blow-up. A distinctive feature of our results is that the analysis of the unbounded inhomogeneous term requires the imposition of radial symmetry on the initial data, which allows us to exploit certain Strauss type Sobolev estimates that would not hold in the general non-radial case. This work complements previous studies on biharmonic Schr\u00f6dinger equations with singular inhomogeneities, highlighting both the challenges and the new phenomena that arise when the nonlinearity is weighted by a growing up unbounded function, which broke the space translation invariance of the standard homogeneous associated equation.",

Our main results include one-shot and asymptotic achievable positive covert-secret key rate pairs for both security metrics. Our results recover as a special case the best-known results for covert communication over state-dependent classical channels. To the best of our knowledge, our results are the first instance of achieving a positive rate for covert secret key generation and the first instance of achieving a positive covert rate over a quantum channel.

The corresponding subproblems are then solved by alternating direction method of multipliers to satisfy the specific stop criteria. In particular, under mild assumptions, we prove that our algorithm guarantees the feasibility of each subsequent iteration point, and the cluster point of the resulting feasible sequence is shown to be a stationary point. Additionally, we extend the group sparse optimization model, pioneer the application of the double iterative reweighted algorithm to solve constrained group sparse models (which exhibits superior efficiency), and incorporate a generalized Bregman distance to characterize the algorithm's termination conditions.

The key ingredient is a regularized Gibbs weight that stabilizes the consensus point and avoids degeneracies present in the classical formulation, eliminating the need for cutoffs, rescaling, or boundedness assumptions on the objective function. Our first main result establishes large-time consensus for the particle system: when the drift exceeds an explicit threshold, all particles converge exponentially to a common random limit that concentrates near the global minimizer. Our second result proves uniform-in-time propagation of chaos, providing quantitative and dimension-free convergence of the empirical measure to the McKean--Vlasov dynamics. Finally, we show that the mean-field system reaches deterministic consensus and that its consensus point approaches the global minimizer in the regime of highly concentrated Gibbs weights. Together, these results yield a unified and internally consistent theoretical framework for consensus-based optimization under substantially relaxed regularity assumptions on the objective function.",

To further enhance computational efficiency, this paper proposes a quotient-manifold-based optimization framework that leverages the underlying Riemannian geometry in a matrix factorization space. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between spectral-sparse signals and matrix equivalence classes under the action of the real orthogonal group, where each class member corresponds to a rank-constrained positive-semidefinite Hankel-Toeplitz structured matrix. The associated quotient manifold geometry--including the Riemannian metric, horizontal space, retraction, and vector transport--is rigorously derived. Based on these results, we develop a Riemannian conjugate gradient descent algorithm, where each iteration is efficiently implemented using fast Fourier transforms (FFTs) by exploiting the Hankel and Toeplitz structures. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm in both computational speed and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

The running and terminal costs are assumed to be continuous in each edge, but may jump at the vertices. Compared to the companion paper [4], we make more general assumptions about the costs and consider networks with an arbitrary number of vertices; this higher degree of generality brings new difficulties.\n  For the optimal control problems mentioned above, we obtain in particular the existence of optimal trajectories and regularity results concerning the optimal trajectories and the value function.\n  These control theoretic results make it possible to address a class of mean field games on networks, with costs that do not depend separately on the control and on the distribution of states, and that are non-local with respect to the latter. Focusing on a Lagrangian formulation, we obtain the existence of relaxed equilibria consisting of probability measures on admissible trajectories. To any relaxed equilibrium corresponds a mild solution, i.e. a pair $(u, m)$ made of the value function $u$ of a related optimal control problem and a family $m = (m(t))_t$ of probability measures on the network. Given $m$, the value function $u$ is a viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi problem on the network. We then investigate the regularity properties of $u$ and a weak form of a Fokker-Planck equation satisfied by $m$.",

It appeared implicitly in the first author's recent work on the compactness of Sobolev embeddings of radially symmetric functions on $\\mathbb{R}^n$. The second is a suitably localized version of the relation of almost-compact embeddings, which has been successfully used to study compactness in function spaces over measure spaces of finite measure, but becomes of no use in the case of infinite measure. Our framework is that of quasi-Banach function spaces, which need not be normable or rearrangement invariant. This level of generality leads us to introduce the notion of extremal fundamental functions associated with a (quasi-)Banach function space. We provide several concrete examples and establish an abstract compactness principle involving the new relations. Finally, we demonstrate a possible application of this principle to embeddings of inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces on $\\mathbb{R}^n$.",

    "abstract": "Grey-box optimisation, where some parts of an optimisation problem are represented by explicit algebraic (glass-box) models while others are treated as black-box models lacking analytic derivatives, remains a challenge in process systems engineering. Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation.",

Within this framework, we consider additional relevant constraints to produce the consensus bucket order, considering configurations with a fixed number of buckets, predefined bucket sizes, top-$k$ type problems, and fairness constraints. All these formulations are developed in a general setting, allowing their application to different rank aggregation contexts. One of these problems is the Optimal Bucket Order Problem (OBOP), for which we propose for the first time an exact formulation and test the variants proposed. The computational study includes, on the one hand, a comparison between the exact results obtained by our models and the heuristic methods proposed by Aledo et al.\\ (2018), and on the other hand, an additional evaluation of their performance on a representative set of instances from the PrefLib library. The results confirm the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach, providing a solid foundation for future research on rank aggregation problems with weak orders as consensus rankings.",

In this model the variances of the entries depends on the block and the limiting density is determined by these variances. In the absence of an atom the density is either bounded or has a power law singularity at the origin. We determine all scaling limits of the spectral density on the eigenvalue spacing scale at this singularity for Gaussian matrices with block numbers $K \\leq 3$. The appropriate scaling for the universal limit is correctly predicted by the global eigenvalue density. For $K=3$ the local one-point function exhibits an additional logarithmic singularity.

By exploiting spacetime and material covariance, the framework yields the corresponding spacetime and convective variational principles, together with transparent expressions for the stress-energy-momentum tensor and the covariant Euler-type balance equations governing nonlinear electromagnetic continua. Coupling to general relativity is naturally incorporated, and when the action is augmented with Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary terms, the gravitational and electromagnetic junction conditions follow directly from the variational formulation. The results provide a coherent foundation for modeling nonlinear electromagnetic continua in relativistic regimes, with relevance to astrophysical systems where relativistic continuum dynamics and electromagnetic fields are known to be strongly coupled, such as neutron-star crusts, magnetar flares, relativistic jets, and accretion disks.

Working on the id\u00e8le class space, we place a real--place Floquet Hamiltonian into an off--diagonal chiral form to obtain a global adelic Dirac operator with an exact involutive symmetry implemented by real reflection and idelic inversion. Arithmetic information is incorporated through a prime--indexed mass deformation built from spherical Hecke operators; when the coefficient functions are even, the perturbed operator preserves the chiral symmetry and produces isolated $\\pm$--paired eigenvalues inside the spectral gaps of the Floquet background. These eigenvalues appear as jump discontinuities of the Dirac spectral shift function, while a separated adelic trace formula expresses the trace as a product of a Floquet orbital factor and a prime--indexed Euler--factor--type term whose logarithmic derivatives yield a prime--orbit expansion reminiscent of the explicit formula. This structure motivates a Dirac reinterpretation of the Hilbert--P\u00f3lya idea, identifying the nontrivial zeros of $\u03b6(s)$ not with the raw spectrum of a single operator but with the spectral--shift discontinuities of a chiral adelic Dirac system under controlled prime--indexed deformations, with finite--prime truncations providing computable models that converge distributionally and enable numerical exploration of arithmetic spectral flow.",

    "abstract": "In 1973 Montgomery formulated the pair correlation conjecture, predicting that the local spacing statistics of the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function coincide with those of eigenvalues of large Hermitian matrices from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE). The zeta function, however, is a fixed deterministic object, and the mechanism by which its zeros reproduce random matrix statistics has remained unclear. In this paper, assuming the Riemann Hypothesis, we prove Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture for the zeros of Hardy's $Z$-function. Building on earlier works, we use a finite-dimensional variational space of sections $Z_N(t;a)$ that approximate $Z(t)$ on each window $[2N,2N+2]$. Inside this space we define the real hall $\\mathcal{RH}_N(\\mathbb{R})$, consisting of those sections whose zeros in the corresponding critical rectangle are real, simple, and remain so along any homotopy from the core section. This real hall plays the role of a random matrix ensemble. Equipping it with a probability measure with smooth, strictly positive density on the coefficient space, we construct a Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equation with reflection at the discriminant boundary. We show that the induced dynamics of the unfolded zeros are, in the bulk, equivalent in law to Dyson Brownian motion with $\u03b2=2$, and by invoking modern universality results for Dyson Brownian motion and log-gases we obtain that, for any such measure, the ensemble-averaged local pair-correlation converges to the GUE sine-kernel law. Finally, using Selberg's probabilistic theory of the argument $S(t)$, we prove that the pair-correlation observables of the canonical approximants $Z_N(t;1)$ over disjoint windows behave asymptotically like decorrelated samples drawn from this GUE-distributed ensemble, and we upgrade the averaged GUE law to a deterministic pair-correlation law for the zeros of $Z(t)$.",

Its low per-iteration computational cost makes it well-suited for solving large-scale or real-time problems where traditional optimisation routines become computationally burdensome. Despite its strong convergence guarantees, Dykstra's algorithm is known to suffer from stalling -- arbitrarily long intervals during which the primal iterates remain constant -- rendering its runtime unpredictable and severely limiting its applicability in time-critical settings. Focusing on polyhedral constraint sets, we derive a closed-form solution for the length of the stalling period once stalling is detected. This result enables a modified, stall-averse version of Dykstra's algorithm that fast-forwards the stalling period via a single, inexpensive update while preserving convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in convergence behaviour, establishing the proposed method as a practical enhancement for a broad class of projection-based algorithms.",

    "abstract": "The Riemann-Hilbert method is employed to carry out an asymptotic analysis of a family of $\u03c3$-Painlev\u00e9 V functions associated with Hankel determinants involving the confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind. In the large-matrix limit, this family degenerates to a family of $\u03c3$-Painlev\u00e9 III$'$ functions, whose precise asymptotic behavior is also obtained. Both families of Painlev\u00e9 functions arise in the study of the joint moments of the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of a CUE random matrix and the polynomial itself, whose asymptotics are closely related to the moments of the Riemann zeta function and the Hardy $\\mathsf{Z}$-function on the critical line. One of our main results establishes a representation of the leading coefficients of these joint moments in terms of $\u03c3$-Painlev\u00e9 III$'$ functions for general real exponents. The other main result resolves a question of Assiotis et al. in [Probab. Math. Physics. 2(2021), 613-642, Remark 2.5] concerning the existence of a probability density for a random variable arising in the ergodic decomposition of Hua-Pickrell measures.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic programming (DP) is a cornerstone of combinatorial optimization, yet its inherently sequential structure has long limited its scalability in scenario-based stochastic programming (SP). This paper introduces a GPU-accelerated framework that reformulates a broad class of forward DP recursions as batched min-plus matrix-vector products over layered DAGs, collapsing actions into masked state-to-state transitions that map seamlessly to GPU kernels. Using this reformulation, our approach takes advantage of massive parallelism across both scenarios and transitions, enabling the simultaneous evaluation of \\emph{over one million uncertainty realizations} in a single GPU pass -- a scale far beyond the reach of existing methods. We instantiate the framework in two canonical applications: the capacitated vehicle routing problem with stochastic demand and a dynamic stochastic inventory routing problem. In both cases, DP subroutines traditionally considered sequential are redesigned to harness two- or three-dimensional GPU parallelism. Experiments demonstrate near-linear scaling in the number of scenarios and yield one to three orders of magnitude speedups over multithreaded CPU baselines, resulting in tighter SAA estimates and significantly stronger first-stage decisions under fixed time budgets. Beyond these applications, our work establishes a general-purpose recipe for transforming classical DP routines into high-throughput GPU primitives, substantially expanding the computational frontier of stochastic discrete optimization to the million-scenario scale.",

    "abstract": "Scientific calculations involving multiplication, division, exponents, inverse exponents of real numbers, geometric mean, reciprocal, Euler number, logarithm, and antilogarithm are generally carried out using battery operated electronic calculators. In this paper, geometric methods employing properties of similar right angled triangles have been devised for performing error free scientific calculations without the use of batteries. Based on this method, a mechanical analogue calculator has also been designed. A right-angled triangle with one perpendicular side of unit length is drawn, and from the vertex of the right angle, a perpendicular is drawn onto the hypotenuse. From the point of intersection of this perpendicular with the hypotenuse, another perpendicular is drawn to the base, and this process is continued until n perpendiculars are drawn. The resultant figure is a right angled triangle containing n similar triangles. Using properties of similar triangles, it is found that the lengths of the first, second, third so on till last perpendicular form a geometric series. If the length of the nth perpendicular is equated to a given real positive quantity less than one, and the base angle is adjusted, then the length of the first perpendicular represents the nth root of the given quantity. If the given quantity is greater than one, its reciprocal is equated to the length of the nth perpendicular, and the reciprocal of the first perpendicular gives the nth root. In this manner, several scientific calculations can be performed using geometric techniques.",

To characterize the end-to-end FRIS channel, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach is introduced, while a Q-learning algorithm is employed to adaptively select the spatial positions of FRIS elements. Numerical evaluations show that optimizing element placement in FRIS significantly improves SOP compared to conventional RIS without phase adaptation. However, these improvements become less evident once the conventional RIS implements optimized beamforming (BF) and phase-shift (PS) controlling. In addition, FRIS maintains a clear advantage over compact RIS designs with optimized BF and PS, mainly due to its lower spatial correlation.

We address the question of desingularization and prove that such vortex patch states are the limit of rotating Euler solutions that are smooth to infinite order, have compact vorticity support, and respect dihedral symmetry. Our nondegeneracy condition is proved to be satisfied by Kirchhoff ellipses and along the local bifurcation curves emanating from the Rankine vortex. The construction, that is based on a local stream function formulation in a tubular neighborhood of the patch boundary, is a synthesis of delicate analysis on thin domains, nonlinear a priori estimates, and a custom version of Newton's method. Our techniques are robust enough to additionally allow us to construct exotic families of singular rotating vortex patch-like solutions nearby a given nondegenerate state. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this work constitutes the first desingularization procedure applicable to general families of steady rotating vortex patches.",

Encoded pilots are used to strengthen the iterative processing, leveraging both pilot and parity bits, while previous estimates are incorporated to further reduce overhead. Simulations consider a sub-6 GHz scenario with non-sparse channels and multiple RIS under both LOS and NLOS conditions.

Statistical analysis demonstrates that: (i) spatial position optimization in FRIS provides noticeable gains over conventional RIS in the absence of phase-shift design; (ii) such benefits vanish when FRIS and conventional RIS employ optimal beamforming (BF) and phase shift (PS) design, making position optimization irrelevant; (iii) FRIS consistently outperforms compact RIS with optimized BF and PS design, owing to spatial correlation and smaller aperture.",

    "title": "Quantitative BMO-BLO Estimates for the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function",
    "abstract": "In this note, we study a quantitative extension of the John-Nirenberg inequality for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function of a $\\operatorname{BMO}$ function. More precisely, for every nonconstant locally integrable function $f$ such that $Mf$ is not identically infinite, we prove the inequality \\begin{equation*}\n  \\left( \\frac{1}{w(Q)}\\int_Q \\left( \\frac{Mf(x) - \\operatorname{ess\\,inf}_{Q} Mf }{M^\\# f(x)} \\right)^p w(x)\\,dx\\right)^\\frac{1}{p} \\le c_n \\, [w]_{A_\\infty}\\, p \\end{equation*} for every cube $Q$, every $1\\le p<\\infty$ and every weight $w\\in A_\\infty$, where $[w]_{A_\\infty}$ denotes the Fujii-Wilson $A_\\infty$ constant. This result extends the classical boundedness $\\|Mf\\|_{\\operatorname{BLO}}\\le C_n\\|f\\|_{\\operatorname{BMO}}$ proved by Bennett, DeVore, and Sharpley (Ann. of Math. (2) 113 (1981)) and by Bennett (Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 85 (1982)). Furthermore, we show that the class $A_\\infty$ is both necessary and sufficient for this inequality to hold, providing a new characterization of $A_\\infty$ in terms of the action of the maximal operator on bounded oscillation spaces.",

    "abstract": "We develop a divergence-minimization (DM) framework for robust and efficient inference in latent-mixture models. By optimizing a residual-adjusted divergence, the DM approach recovers EM as a special case and yields robust alternatives through different divergence choices. We establish that the sample objective decreases monotonically along the iterates, leading the DM sequence to stationary points under standard conditions, and that at the population level the operator exhibits local contractivity near the minimizer. Additionally, we verify consistency and $\\sqrt{n}$-asymptotic normality of minimum-divergence estimators and of finitely many DM iterations, showing that under correct specification their limiting covariance matches the Fisher information. Robustness is analyzed via the residual-adjustment function, yielding bounded influence functions and a strictly positive breakdown bound for bounded-RAF divergences, and we contrast this with the non-robust behaviour of KL/EM. Next, we address the challenge of determining the number of mixture components by proposing a penalized divergence criterion combined with repeated sample splitting, which delivers consistent order selection and valid post-selection inference. Empirically, DM instantiations based on Hellinger and negative exponential divergences deliver accurate inference and remain stable under contamination in mixture and image-segmentation tasks. The results clarify connections to MM and proximal-point methods and offer practical defaults, making DM a drop-in alternative to EM for robust latent-structure inference.",

In particular, our interaction matrix has \\textbf{two} large outlier eigenvalues with mutual distance $\\frac{c}{n}$. The empirical measure of the rest of the eigenvalues is close to the semicircular law with some rigidity conditions. We prove that in this scenario the overlap distribution of two independent samples from the Gibbs measure has a continuous density at a low enough temperature. Hence, the model is a full replica symmetry-breaking model. One might compare this result with only one outlier eigenvalue. This model comes for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with Curie-Weiss interaction in the ferromagnetic case. Here, it is well known that the model is replica symmetric, although the free energy limit of this model is the same as the free energy limit of our model. In our limited understanding, we believe that this kind of phenomenon cannot be explained by the Parisi approach.",

In particular, we consider a two-dimensional lattice structure and determine how different choices of the spanning vectors influence the resulting dynamical tramsitions and pattern formations. As the basic steady-state loses its linear stability, the binary system undergoes a dynamic transition which is shown to be characterized by both the geometry of the domain and the choice of physical parameters of the model. Unlike rectangular domains, we are able to observe the emergence of hexagonally-packed circles, as well as the familiar rolls and square structures. We begin with the decomposition of our function space into a stable and unstable eigenspace before calculating the center manifold that maps the former to the later. In analyzing the resulting reduced equations, we consider the different multiplicities that the critical eigenvalue can have, which is shown to be geometry-dependent. We briefly consider the long-range interaction model and determine that it produces similar results to the original model.",

In particular, the matrix-valued transmission and reflection coefficients for the full-line lattice are explicitly expressed in terms of the scattering coefficients for the left and right lattice fragments. Since the matrix-valued scattering coefficients are easier to determine for the fragments than for the full-line lattice, the factorization formula presented provides a method to determine the scattering coefficients for full-line lattices.

We theoretically prove that the objective function of the average secrecy rate maximization problem is quasi-concave with respect to an adjustment factor of the rotatable antenna. Under this condition, the optimal solution can be found by the bisection search. Furthermore, we derive the closed-form optimal deflection angle for the secrecy capacity maximization problem, considering the existence of only line-of-sight components of wireless channels. This solution serves as a near optimal solution to the average secrecy rate maximization problem. Based on the closed-form near optimal solution, we obtain the system secrecy outage probability at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It is shown through simulation results that the near optimal solution achieves almost the same average secrecy capacity as the optimal solution. It is also found that at high SNR, the theoretical secrecy outage probabilities match the simulation ones.",

    "abstract": "Millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks have the potential to support high throughput and low-latency requirements of 5G-and-beyond communication standards. But transmissions in this band are highly vulnerable to attenuation and blockages from humans, buildings, and foliage, which increase end-to-end packet delays. This work designs dynamic scheduling policies that minimize end-to-end packet delays while keeping packet transmission costs low. Specifically, we consider a mmWave network that consists of a transmitter that transmits data packets over an unreliable communication channel modeled as a Gilbert-Elliott channel.The transmitter operates under an ACK/NACK feedback model and does not observe the channel state unless it attempts a transmission. The objective is to minimize a weighted average cost consisting of end-to-end packet delays and packet transmission costs. We pose this dynamic optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first POMDP formulation for mmWave network with partial channel state information that considers delay minimization. We show that the POMDP admits a solution that has a threshold structure, i.e., for each queue length, the belief (the conditional probability that the channel is in a good state) is partitioned into intervals, and the transmitter sends j packets when the belief lies in the j-th interval. We then consider the case when the system parameters such as the packet arrival rate, and the transition probabilities of the channel are not known, and leverage these structural results in order to use the actor-critic algorithm to efficiently search for a policy that is locally optimal.",

In representation theory, torsion theories and lattices of torsion classes of mod$ A$, for $A$ a finite-dimensional algebra, have been widely studied. The more recent definition of pretorsion theories, that can be given for any category, has expanded the theory, giving many more instances of ``non-pointed torsion theories'' in unexpected settings. In this work, we introduce and study the lattice $\\mathcal{L}_t(A)$ of pretorsion classes of mod$ A$. These lattices are in close connection with the lattices tors$ A$ of torsion classes of mod$ A$. We fully describe the completely join-irreducible elements of $\\mathcal{L}_t(A)$.

There are now several documented examples where they have helped professional mathematical scientists prove new results, sometimes even helping resolve known open problems. In this short note, we add another example to the list, by documenting how we were able to solve a previously unsolved research problem in robust mathematical statistics with crucial help from GPT-5. Our problem concerns robust density estimation, where the observations are perturbed by Wasserstein-bounded contaminations.In a previous preprint (Chao and Dobriban, 2023, arxiv:2308.01853v2), we have obtained upper and lower bounds on the minimax optimal estimation error; which were, however, not sharp.\n  Starting in October 2025, making significant use of GPT-5 Pro, we were able to derive the minimax optimal error rate (reported in version 3 of the above arxiv preprint). GPT-5 provided crucial help along the way, including by suggesting calculations that we did not think of, and techniques that were not familiar to us, such as the dynamic Benamou-Brenier formulation, for key steps in the analysis. Working with GPT-5 took a few weeks of effort, and we estimate that it could have taken several months to get the same results otherwise. At the same time, there are still areas where working with GPT-5 was challenging: it sometimes provided incorrect references, and glossed over details that sometimes took days of work to fill in. We outline our workflow and steps taken to mitigate issues. Overall, our work can serve as additional documentation for a new age of human-AI collaborative work in mathematical science.",

    "abstract": "Standard Virtual Element Methods (VEM) are based on polynomial projections and require a stabilization term to evaluate the contribution of the non-polynomial component of the discrete space. However, the stabilization term does not generally conform to the physics of the considered problem and a criterion for its choice is not typically supported by theoretical arguments. Hence, stabilization-free and self-stabilized formulations have been proposed. Moreover, the accuracy of VEM deteriorates in case of problems with variable coefficients, that are not usually accounted when constructing polynomial projections. The mentioned aspects might limit the use of the method when tackling real-world applications. This paper provides an in-depth numerical investigation into different stabilized and self-stabilized formulations for the p-version of VEM. The results show that self-stabilized and stabilization-free formulations achieve optimal accuracy, while suffering from worse conditioning. Moreover, a new approach for dealing with variable coefficients is introduced: the discrete space is modified so that general coefficients can be accounted when computing the polynomial projectors. Numerical results show that this new approach is more robust than the standard ones.",

The receiver aims to decode only user 1 message but may also decode user 2 message when beneficial. In the synchronous setting, the receiver employs two parallel sub-decoders: one dedicated to decoding user 1 message and another that jointly decodes both users messages. Their outputs are synthesized to produce the final decoding or collision decision. For the asynchronous setting, we examine a time interval containing $L$ consecutive codewords from each user. The receiver deploys $2^{2L}$ parallel sub-decoders, each responsible for decoding a subset of the message-code index pairs. In both synchronous and asynchronous cases, every sub-decoder partitions the coding space into three disjoint regions: operation, margin, and collision, and outputs either decoded messages or a collision report according to the region in which the estimated code index vector lies. Error events are defined for each sub-decoder and for the overall receiver whenever the expected output is not produced. We derive achievable upper bounds on the generalized error performance, defined as a weighted sum of incorrect-decoding, collision, and miss-detection probabilities, for both synchronous and asynchronous scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Fluid antenna systems (FAS) allow dynamic reconfiguration to achieve superior diversity gains and reliability. To quantify the performance scaling of FAS with a large number of antenna ports, this paper leverages extreme value theory (EVT) to conduct an asymptotic analysis of the outage probability (OP) and ergodic capacity (EC). The analysis reveals that the OP decays approximately exponentially with the number of antenna ports. Moreover, we establish upper and lower bounds for the asymptotic EC, uncovering its double-logarithmic scaling law. Furthermore, we re-substantiate these scaling laws by exploiting the fact that the mode of the Gumbel distribution scales logarithmically. Besides, we theoretically prove that spatial correlation among antenna ports degrades both OP and EC. All analytical findings are conclusively validated by numerical results.",

These are maximally non-integrable distributions with natural symplectisations and contactisations, that generalize contact distributions to higher corank. We focus on the corank-$2$ case, where we study a natural class of submanifolds, which we call prelegendrians. Their key feature is that they admit a canonical Legendrian lift to the contactisation. Our main results state that the $h$-principle fails for these submanifolds in all dimensions. This is the first example of rigidity in the study of maximally non-integrable distributions, outside of contact topology.\n  First, we find an infinite family of $(2n+1)$-tori in the standard fat $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$, with the following two properties: (1) They all represent the same formal prelegendrian class, (2) but they are not prelegendrian isotopic because they are distinguished by pseudoholomorphic curve invariants of their Legendrian lift.\n  Secondly, we define the notion of prelegendrian stabilization in $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$. This allows us to take an arbitrary prelegendrian and produce another one, in the same formal class, whose Legendrian lift is loose.\n  In order to prove these results we also develop the fundamentals of the theory of prelegendrians. This includes: (1) introducing the notion of front projection in $(\\mathbb{C}^{2n+1},\\mathcal{D}_{\\mathrm{std}})$, (2) proving that pseudoholomorphic curve invariants are robust under perturbations of the fat structure, allowing us to transport our results to non-standard fat structures, (3) introducing a zooming argument showing that any fat structure in dimension $6$ admits prelegendrians.",

We analyze the dimension, number of weights, and weight distribution of the constructed codes, and establish connections with the extendability of the original codes as well as the partial weight distribution of the derived codes. As a new tool, this framework enables us to establish an upper bound on the minimum weight of two-weight codes and to characterize all two-weight codes attaining this bound. Moreover, several divisibility properties concerning the parameters of two-weight codes are derived. The proposed method not only generates new families of linear codes but also provides a powerful approach for exploring the intrinsic combinatorial and geometric structures of existing codes.",

Its relevance to medical applications also drives advances in DNA-related biotechnology.\n  To protect our data against errors, a straightforward approach uses one error-correcting code per DNA strand, with a Reed--Solomon code protecting the collection of strands. A downside is that current technology can only synthesize strands 200--300 nucleotides long. At this block length, the inner code rate suffers a significant finite-length penalty, making its effective capacity hard to characterize.\n  Last year, we proposed $\\textit{Geno-Weaving}$ in a JSAIT publication. The idea is to protect the same position across multiple strands using one code; this provably achieves capacity against substitution errors. In this paper, we extend the idea to combat deletion errors and show two more advantages of Geno-Weaving: (1) Because the number of strands is 3--4 orders of magnitude larger than the strand length, the finite-length penalty vanishes. (2) At realistic deletion rates $0.1\\%$--$10\\%$, Geno-Weaving designed for BSCs works well empirically, bypassing the need to tailor the design for deletion channels.",

    "abstract": "The rapid scaling of artificial intelligence models has revealed a fundamental tension between model capacity (storage) and inference efficiency (computation). While classical information theory focuses on transmission and storage limits, it lacks a unified physical framework to quantify the thermodynamic costs of generating information from compressed laws versus retrieving it from memory. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework that treats information processing as an enabling mapping from ontological states to carrier states. We introduce a novel metric, Derivation Entropy, which quantifies the effective work required to compute a target state from a given logical depth. By analyzing the interplay between Shannon entropy (storage) and computational complexity (time/energy), we demonstrate the existence of a critical phase transition point. Below this threshold, memory retrieval is thermodynamically favorable; above it, generative computation becomes the optimal strategy. This \"Energy-Time-Space\" conservation law provides a physical explanation for the efficiency of generative models and offers a rigorous mathematical bound for designing next-generation, energy-efficient AI architectures. Our findings suggest that the minimization of Derivation Entropy is a governing principle for the evolution of both biological and artificial intelligence.",

A key enabler of DiPASS is our new \"equal quota division\" power allocation strategy, which guarantees predetermined coupling lengths independent of antenna positions, thereby overcoming a critical barrier to practical deployment. Our analysis yields foundational insights: we derive closed-form solutions for optimal antenna placement and orientation in single-PA scenarios, quantifying the core trade-off between waveguide and free-space losses. For multi-PA systems, we develop a scalable optimization framework that leverages directional sparsity, revealing that waveguide diversity surpasses antenna density in enhancing system capacity. Extensive simulations validate our analysis and demonstrate that DiPASS provides a realistic performance benchmark, fundamentally reshaping the understanding and design principles for future PASS-enabled 6G networks.",

The proof combines pseudodifferential tools with dynamical systems results: we perform a resonant normal form procedure to reduce our analysis to the classical dynamics for the resonant equation. The main difficulty lies in the proof of the instability result, for which we explicitly construct an escape function associated to the dynamics.

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel quadrature strategy for Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) boundary element discretizations, specifically tailored to collocation methods. Thanks to the dimensionality reduction and the natural handling of unbounded domains, boundary integral formulations are particularly appealing in the IgA framework. However, they require the evaluation of boundary integrals whose kernels exhibit singular or nearly singular behavior. Even when the kernel is not singular, its numerical evaluation becomes challenging whenever the integration region lies close to a collocation point. These integrals of polar and nearly singular functions represent the main computational difficulty of IgA-BEM and motivate the development of efficient and accurate quadrature rules. Unlike traditional methods that classify integrals as singular, nearly singular, or regular, our approach employs a desingularizing change of variables that smoothly adapts to the physical distance from singularities in the boundary integral kernels. The transformation intensifies near the polar point and progressively weakens when integrating over portions of the domain that are farther from it, ultimately leaving the integrand unchanged in the limit of a diametrically opposed region. This automatic calibration enhances accuracy and robustness by eliminating the traditional classification step, to which the approximation quality is often highly sensitive. Moreover, integration is performed directly over B-spline supports rather than over individual elements, reducing computational cost, particularly for higher-degree splines. The proposed method is validated through boundary element benchmarks for the three dimensional Stokes problem, where we achieve excellent convergence rates.",

This identity leads to two key limits for surface integrals involving scattered solutions, from which we deduce the first uniqueness result of direct problem for all frequencies. Through a detailed analysis, applying the steepest descent method, subsequently we derive the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding two-layered Green's tensor along with its explicit expression when the transmission coefficient equals 1. Finally, by leveraging properties of the Green's tensor, we establish the existence of solutions via the variational method and the boundary integral equation, thereby achieving the first well-posedness result for elastic scattering by rough interfaces.",

    "abstract": "The hull of a linear code is defined as the intersection of the code and its dual. This concept was initially introduced to classify finite projective planes. The hull plays a crucial role in determining the complexity of algorithms used to check the permutation equivalence of two linear codes and compute a linear code's automorphism group. Research has shown that these algorithms are very effective when the hull size is small. Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have the smallest hulls, while codes with a one-dimensional hull have the second smallest.\n  A recent notable paper that directs our investigation is authored by H. Chen, titled ``On the Hull-Variation Problem of Equivalent Linear Codes\", published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, volume 69, issue 5, in 2023. In this paper, we first explore the one-dimensional hull of a linear code over finite fields. Additionally, we demonstrate that any LCD code over an extended binary field \\( \\FF_q \\) (where \\( q > 3 \\)) with a minimum distance of at least $2$ is equivalent to the one-dimensional hull of a linear code under a specific weak condition. Furthermore, we provide a construction for creating hulls with \\( \\ell + 1 \\)-dimensionality from an \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hull of a linear code, again under a weak condition. This corresponds to a particularly challenging direction, as creating \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hulls from \\( \\ell + 1 \\)-dimensional hulls. Finally, we derive several constructions for the \\( \\ell \\)-dimensional hulls of linear codes as a consequence of our results.",

Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences.\n  As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field.\n  Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Lebl\u00e9 and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.",

For 3-manifolds with boundary, we show that surface skein modules carry an action by a certain surface skein category associated with the boundary, which yields a gluing formalism. Our main result concerns a partial extension of $\\mathsf{AFK}_A$ to dimension 4, which uses an inductive state-sum construction following Walker. As an example, the equivariant version of Lee's deformation of dotted cobordisms yields a TQFT that extends to 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies but not 3-handlebodies. Finally, we characterize the attachment of 4-dimensional 2-handles by means of a certain Kirby color and use it to compute the invariants of 4-dimensional 2-handlebodies in examples.",

We prove that the closed-loop system resulting from the interconnection of the suboptimal and reduced-order MPC optimizer with the full-order plant has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium point. Specifically, we employ timescale separation arguments to characterize the interaction between the components of the feedback-interconnected system. The analysis relies on an appropriately tuned timescale parameter accounting for how fast the system dynamics are sampled.

In many ways, our methods parallel Li's work generalizing Regge calculus to higher order, as Regge elements can be thought of as symmetric tensor products of one-forms. However, whereas the constant coefficient Regge space has one shape function per edge, the constant coefficient space of double-forms in our paper has one shape function per triangle and two shape functions per tetrahedron, so we must address the fact that there are shape functions of two different types.

In this work, the stationary states of the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for linear acoustics on Cartesian grids are explored theoretically and experimentally, thus extending previous studies in the context of first-order finite difference methods. It is found that for a polynomial degree above some threshold, DG is stationarity preserving, but depending on the choice of numerical flux can suffer from a reduction of the order of accuracy at stationary state.

The relativistic formulation provides a physically consistent setting for multi-species systems where inertia and internal energy depend on temperature, as occurs in astrophysical plasmas or relativistic fluids. Using the entropy principle, we derive uniform lower bounds for temperature and establish asymptotic flocking under various communication kernels.

A straightforwardly constructible class of polyhedra - called quasi-symmetric nets (QS-nets) - is introduced, characterized by a symmetry relation among flat angles. It is shown that every elliptic QS-net has equimodular elliptic type and is flexible in real three-dimensional Euclidean space (rather than only in complex configuration spaces), except for a few exceptional choices of dihedral angles, and that its flexion admits a closed-form parameterization. Examples are constructed that are non-self-intersecting and belong exclusively to the equimodular elliptic type. To support applications in computational geometry, a numerical pipeline is developed that searches for candidate solutions, verifies them using the explicit algebraic characterization, and constructs and visualizes the resulting polyhedra; numerical validations achieve high precision. Taken together, these results provide constructive criteria, algorithms, and validated examples for the equimodular elliptic type, enabling the design of a broad range of flexible Kokotsakis mechanisms.",

    "title": "A direct approach to soft and hard edge universality for random normal matrices",
    "abstract": "We develop a unified approach to universality of local scaling limits for eigenvalues of random normal matrices, or equivalently for planar Coulomb gases at inverse temperature $\u03b2=2$. The approach is direct in that it does not rely on expressing the kernels in terms of orthogonal polynomials. There are three main results. The first is a proof of universality at hard edges with no symmetry assumptions on either the potential or the hard edge. We also prove local universality at regular soft edges for droplets with several components, and lastly for soft/hard edges where a hard edge perfectly aligns with the droplet boundary. The main ingredients are Paley-Wiener type spectral embeddings for the Hilbert space associated with a limiting kernel, and the construction of weighted polynomials peaking near a given boundary point.",

    "title": "Multigrid with Linear Storage Complexity",
    "abstract": "As the discretization error for the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) decreases, the precision required to store the corresponding coefficients naturally increases. Storing the solution's finite element coefficients explicitly requires $\\mathcal O(n \\log n)$ bits of storage, where $n$ is the number of degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper presents a full multigrid method to compute the solution in a compressed format that reduces the storage complexity of the solution and intermediate vectors to $\\mathcal O(n)$ bits. This reduction allows a matrix-free implementation to solve elliptic PDEs with an overall linear space complexity. For problems limited by the memory capacity of current supercomputers, we expect a memory footprint reduction of about an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods. We demonstrate the applicability of our algorithm by solving two model problems. Depending on the PDE and polynomial degree, but irrespective of the problem size, the solution vector on the finest grid requires between 4 and 12 bits per DoF, and the residual and correction require 3 to 6 bits each. Additional data is stored on the coarse grids with modestly increasing bit widths toward coarser grids.",
