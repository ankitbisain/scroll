Initially, we examine the residue and torsion codes of various hulls of $E$-linear codes and obtain an explicit form of the generator matrix of the hull of a free $E$-linear code. Then, we propose four build-up construction methods to construct codes with a larger length and hull-rank from codes with a smaller length and hull-rank. Some illustrative examples are also given to support our build-up construction methods. Subsequently, we study the permutation equivalence of two free $E$-linear codes and discuss the hull-variation problem. As an application, we classify optimal free $E$-linear codes for lengths up to $8$.",

Varying $n$ only, and also varying $n$ and $k$ (the number of blocks of the set partitions) simultaneously, we can show that those posets form a projective system of trees and lattices (after giving a lattice structure in a natural way).

A paradigmatic case of a candidate irregular type is $n=4$, although to date no value of $n$ has been proven to have such a growth rate. Here, we provide strong numerical evidence against this conjectured growth rate for $n=4$. Specifically, for $n=4$, it seems plausible that the upper bound is $O(n^2/\\log n)$ but that the lower bound is in fact $\u03a9(n^{2-\u03b4})$ for some $\u03b4> 0$. This appears to be because the sequence is not totally \"random\" as has been assumed. Limitations of the numerical method here is discussed.",

Moreover, a celebrated result of Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev gives a symmetric, minimal resolution of the diagonal for smooth projective toric varieties. This work studies when smooth projective toric Fano varieties in dimension 5 yield exceptional collections of line bundles using a resolution of the diagonal. We give the first known count of 300 out of 866 smooth projective toric Fano 5-folds for which the Hanlon-Hicks-Lazarev resolution of the diagonal yields a full strong exceptional collection of line bundles.",

We investigate the question: when are minimal rational curves on $X$ orbit-closures of 1-parameter subgroups of $G$? We show that this is the case if the variety of minimal rational tangents (VMRT) at a base point in $G/H \\subset X$ is Gauss-nondegenerate. Our method combines algebraic geometry of minimal rational curves with differential geometry of symmetric spaces: orbits of 1-parameter subgroups arise as holomorphic geodesics of an invariant torsion-free affine connection on $G/H$. We prove furthermore that the Gauss-nondegeneracy of VMRT holds for nonsingular equivariant compactifications of simple algebraic groups regarded as symmetric spaces. In this case, we also show that the VMRT is the closure of an adjoint orbit, which generalizes a result of Brion and Fu's on wonderful compactifications to arbitrary equivariant compactifications.",

Within this setting, we identify the Reeb vector field as the intrinsic generator of irreversibility and derive explicit laws describing how dissipation modifies symmetry reduction and momentum evolution. As a concrete application, we construct the contact Hamiltonian formulation of the rigid body with isotropic and anisotropic damping, classify all equilibrium configurations, and analyze their stability. Building on this continuous formulation, we design a second-order structure preserving contact variational integrator obtained by a symmetric splitting of kinetic, potential, and dissipative components. Numerical experiments for representative dissipative systems demonstrate accurate energy decay, geometric consistency, and recovery of the symplectic Verlet scheme in the conservative limit. The proposed framework provides a coherent connection between the geometry of contact dynamics, physical irreversibility, and numerically stable integration, offering new tools for the analysis of mixed conservative dissipative mechanical systems.",

    "title": "A Framework for Scalable Digital Twin Deployment in Smart Campus Building Facility Management",
    "abstract": "Digital twin (DT) offers significant opportunities for enhancing facility management (FM) in campus environments. However, existing research often focuses narrowly on isolated domains, such as point-cloud geometry or energy analytics, without providing a scalable and interoperable workflow that integrates building geometry, equipment metadata, and operational data into a unified FM platform. This study proposes a comprehensive framework for scalable digital-twin deployment in smart campus buildings by integrating 3D laser scanning, BIM modeling, and IoT-enabled data visualization to support facility operations and maintenance. The methodology includes: (1) reality capture using terrestrial laser scanning and structured point-cloud processing; (2) development of an enriched BIM model incorporating architectural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, conveying, and sensor systems; and (3) creation of a digital-twin environment that links equipment metadata, maintenance policies, and simulated IoT data within a digital-twin management platform. A case study of the Price Gilbert Building at Georgia Tech demonstrates the implementation of this workflow. A total of 509 equipment items were modeled and embedded with OmniClass classifications into the digital twin. Ten interactive dashboards were developed to visualize system performance. Results show that the proposed framework enables centralized asset documentation, improved system visibility, and enhanced preventive and reactive maintenance workflows. Although most IoT data were simulated due to limited existing sensor infrastructure, the prototype validates the feasibility of a scalable digital twin for facility management and establishes a reference model for real-time monitoring, analytics integration, and future autonomous building operations.",

In our first main result, we introduce an equitable partition of $X$ that has $6D-2$ subsets and the following feature: for every subset in the equitable partition, the vertices in the subset are equidistant to $x$ and equidistant to $y$. This equitable partition is called the $(x,y)$-partition of $X$. By definition, the subconstituent algebra $T=T(x)$ is generated by the Bose-Mesner algebra of $\u0393$ and the dual Bose-Mesner algebra of $\u0393$ with respect to $x$. As we will see, for the $(x,y)$-partition of $X$ the characteristic vectors of the subsets form a basis for a $T$-module $U=U(x,y)$. In our second main result, we decompose $U$ into an orthogonal direct sum of irreducible $T$-modules. This sum has five summands: the primary $T$-module and four irreducible $T$-modules that have endpoint one.\n  We show that every irreducible $T$-module with endpoint one is isomorphic to exactly one of the nonprimary summands.",

    "abstract": "Classical spectral graph theory and graph signal processing rely on a symmetry principle: undirected graphs induce symmetric (self-adjoint) adjacency/Laplacian operators, yielding orthogonal eigenbases and energy-preserving Fourier expansions. Real-world networks are typically directed and hence asymmetric, producing non-self-adjoint and frequently non-normal operators for which orthogonality fails and spectral coordinates can be ill-conditioned. In this paper we develop an original harmonic-analysis framework for directed networks centered on the \\emph{adjacency} operator. We propose a \\emph{Biorthogonal Graph Fourier Transform} (BGFT) built from left/right eigenvectors, formulate directed ``frequency'' and filtering in the non-Hermitian setting, and quantify how asymmetry and non-normality affect stability via condition numbers and a departure-from-normality functional. We prove exact synthesis/analysis identities under diagonalizability, establish sampling-and-reconstruction guarantees for BGFT-bandlimited signals, and derive perturbation/stability bounds that explain why naive orthogonal-GFT assumptions break down on non-normal directed graphs. A simulation protocol compares undirected versus directed cycles (asymmetry without non-normality) and a perturbed directed cycle (genuine non-normality), demonstrating that BGFT yields coherent reconstruction and filtering across asymmetric regimes.",

    "abstract": "The admissibility problem in integral geometry asks for which collections of affine subspaces the Radon transform remains injective. In the discrete setting, this becomes a purely combinatorial question about recovering a function on a finite vector space from its sums over a prescribed family of affine subspaces. In this paper, we study the spatial X-ray transform (line transform) over the finite vector spaces $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$ and give a complete structural and enumerative description of admissible line complexes in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{4}$. We prove that any admissible line complex in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{4}$ can be obtained by taking a disjoint union of one or more odd cycles and attaching trees to the cycle vertices. Using this structural description, we carry out a systematic case-by-case enumeration of all admissible complexes in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{4}$ and derive an exact total count. We then generalize our approach to an algorithm that applies to $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{n}$ for arbitrary $n$, and we then implement it to obtain the total number of admissible complexes in $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{5}$. Our results extend previous small-dimensional classifications and provide an algorithmic framework for studying admissibility in higher dimensions. Beyond their intrinsic combinatorial interest, these structures model discrete sampling schemes for tomographic imaging, and they suggest further connections between admissibility, incidence matrices, and spectral properties of the associated graphs.",

    "abstract": "Large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) have shown strong capability in wireless communications, yet existing works mainly rely on their generalized knowledge across environments while overlooking the potential gains of environment-specific adaptation. Directly fine-tuning LAMs for adaptation is often impractical due to prohibitive training costs, low inference efficiency in multi-user scenarios, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting, in addition to the limited accessibility of model parameters. To address these limitations, we establish a collaborative framework for air interface. In this framework, unlike prior approaches that either depend solely on LAMs or require direct fine-tuning, LAMs are exploited as a universal channel knowledge base while small artificial intelligence models (SAMs) are employed as lightweight plugins to capture environment-specific knowledge, facilitating efficient environment-specific adaptation of LAMs. Subsequently, we instantiate this framework for CSI feedback tasks, and develop a large and small collaboration framework for CSI feedback, referred to as LASCO. LASCO operates by letting the base LAM produce an initial CSI reconstruction, learning the environment-induced reconstruction shift through a reference SAM and a proxy SAM, and transferring this shift back to the LAM. To further enhance adaptability, we introduce elastic-LASCO (E-LASCO), which augments LASCO with learnable collaboration coefficients that control the contribution of LAMs and SAMs across different environments. Numerical results demonstrate that LASCO and E-LASCO enables LAMs to achieve environment-specific performance gains with significantly reduced training costs, lower data collection requirements, and faster adaptation speed.",

We propose a two-level additive domain decomposition method to efficiently solve the linear system associated with the stationary problem, as well as the linear systems that arise at each time step of the time-dependent problem through implicit time discretization. We present a rigorous convergence analysis of the domain decomposition method when used as a preconditioner, quantifying the convergence rate with respect to network connectivity and heterogeneity.

Privacy is characterized by the $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$-hyperedge differential privacy (DP), an extension of the notion of $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$-edge DP in the literature. The hypergraph observations are modeled through a $h$-uniform stochastic block model ($h$-HSBM) in the dense regime. We investigate three differentially private mechanisms: stability-based, sampling-based, and perturbation-based mechanisms. We calculate the exact recovery threshold for each mechanism and study the contraction of the exact recovery region due to the privacy budget, $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$. Sampling-based mechanisms and randomized response mechanisms guarantee pure $\u03b5$-hyperedge DP where $\u03b4=0$, while the stability-based mechanisms cannot achieve this level of privacy. The dependence of the limits of the privacy budget on the parameters of the $h$-uniform hypergraph is studied. More precisely, it is proven rigorously that the minimum privacy budget scales logarithmically with the ratio between the density of in-cluster hyperedges and the cross-cluster hyperedges for stability-based and Bayesian sampling-based mechanisms, while this budget depends only on the size of the hypergraph for the randomized response mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Diverse emerging VR applications integrate streaming of high fidelity 360 video content that requires ample amounts of computation and data rate. Scalable 360 video tiling enables having elastic VR computational tasks that can be scaled adaptively in computation and data rate based on the available user and system resources. We integrate scalable 360 video tiling in an edge-client wireless multi-connectivity architecture for joint elastic task computation offloading across multiple VR users called ElasticVR. To balance the trade-offs in communication, computation, energy consumption, and QoE that arise herein, we formulate a constrained QoE and energy optimization problem that integrates the multi-user/multi-connectivity action space with the elasticity of VR computational tasks. The ElasticVR framework introduces two multi-agent deep reinforcement learning solutions, namely CPPG and IPPG. CPPG adopts a centralized training and centralized execution approach to capture the coupling between users' communication and computational demands. This leads to globally coordinated decisions at the cost of increased computational overheads and limited scalability. To address the latter challenges, we also explore an alternative strategy denoted IPPG that adopts a centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. IPPG leverages shared information and parameter sharing to learn robust policies; however, during execution, each user takes action independently based on its local state information only. The decentralized execution alleviates the communication and computation overhead of centralized decision-making and improves scalability. We show that the ElasticVR framework improves the PSNR by 43.21%, while reducing the response time and energy consumption by 42.35% and 56.83%, respectively, compared with a case where no elasticity is incorporated into VR computations.",

Shortly after, they were defined and studied intrinsically by Effros and Ruan, and by this author. In 1998, with the introduction of the multiplier Hopf algebras with integrals (also called algebraic quantum groups), the duality between discrete and compact quantum groups became part of the more general duality in the self-dual category of these algebraic quantum groups. Again a few years later the duality was extended to all locally compact quantum groups.\n  In these notes, we give a new and a somewhat updated approach of the theory of discrete quantum groups. In particular, we view them as special cases of algebraic quantum groups. The duality between the compact quantum groups and the discrete quantum groups is seen in this larger context. This has a number of advantages as we will explain.\n  On the one hand, we provide quite a bit of information about how all of this fits into the more general theory of algebraic quantum groups and its duality. Occasionally, we even go one step further and look at the most general case of locally compact quantum groups. Also sometimes, we compare with known results in pure Hopf algebra theory. On the other hand however, we have tried to make these notes highly self-contained. The aim of these notes in the first place is not to give new results but rather to review known results in a more modern perspective, taking into account recent developments. We believe this may be helpful for people who want to work with compact and discrete quantum groups now.",

    "abstract": "We develop a thermally coupled Ginzburg-Landau theory on \\emph{Weakly Non-Tonelli (WNT) Finsler manifolds}, extending classical vortex analysis beyond the Tonelli convexity paradigm. The WNT framework weakens global $1$-homogeneity and strict convexity while preserving superlinearity and local ellipticity, enabling a geometric treatment of superconductors whose anisotropic energy landscapes are nonconvex and temperature-dependent. Within this setting, we construct the generalized Legendre correspondence, Hamiltonian metric, and WNT Laplacian, proving existence and sharp Coulomb asymptotics of the three-dimensional Green kernel. We then establish the $\u0393$--convergence of the WNT-GL energy and identify metastable vortex filaments minimizing a renormalized geometric functional. Finally, a dynamic $\u0393$-limit yields an effective filament flow governed by the WNT Finsler curvature and thermally induced geometric forces, predicting curvature focusing and phase bifurcation at a critical transition temperature $T_c$. This theory unifies convex-analytic, geometric, and physical perspectives, showing that Non-Tonelli Finsler structures form a natural analytic bridge between classical Finsler geometry, anisotropic variational models, and the nonlinear thermodynamics of exotic superconductivity.",

Almost just as often it has been pointed out that this \"eventually\" is well beyond any conceivably relevant time frame. We point out that an educated monkey that still types at random but is constrained to only write \"statistically typical\" text, would produce any given passage in a much shorter time. Information theory gives a very simple way to estimate that time. For example, Shakespeare's phrase, Better three hours too soon than a minute too late, from The Merry Wives of Windsor, would take the educated monkey only 73 thousand years to produce, compared to the beyond-astronomical $2.7 \\times 10^{63}$ years for the randomly typing one. Despite the obvious improvement, it would still take the educated monkey an unimaginably long $10^{42,277}$ years to produce all of Hamlet.",

In this paper, we rigorously establish this equivalence by constructing a continuous family of unitaries that bridges the discrete algebraic teleportation protocol and modular flow. We resolve the obstruction of dynamic idempotency, inherent in Type III von Neumann algebras, by employing the Haagerup-Kosaki crossed-product construction. This lift to the semifinite envelope yields a canonical, dynamically consistent path whose unique self-adjoint generator $\\tilde{G}$ is proven to be exactly twice the modular Hamiltonian difference, $\\tilde{G}=2(K_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{M}}}-K_{\\tilde{\\mathcal{N}}})$. We establish this identity as a closed operator equivalence using Nelson's analytic vector theorem and quantify its structural robustness via Kosaki's non-commutative $L^p$ theory.

    "title": "Measuring Asymptotic Convergence: A Unified Framework from Isotropic Infinity to Anisotropic Ends",
    "abstract": "We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point \u03c9_A to the space A and define convergence a \\to \u03c9_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts.",

The main challenge is to develop an effective approximate system of equations that is asymptotically consistent with the free-boundary Lin-Liu model expressed in the Lagrangian coordinates.

We prove a strengthened version of this theorem for the hierarchical lattice, where the relevant threshold is at $|x-y|^{-2d} \\log\\log |x-y|$ rather than $|x-y|^{-2}$: There is a continuous phase transition for kernels of larger order, a discontinuous phase transition for kernels of exactly this order, and no phase transition at all for kernels of smaller order.

Our main focus is the geometrically linear two-well problem, for which we characterize the energy scaling in two dimensions for nearly all combinations of linear boundary data and stress-free strains. In particular, we prove that if the boundary data enforces oscillations and the weight $\u03b5$ of the surface energy is small, the minimal energy upon subtracting the zeroth-order contribution scales either as $\u03b5^{{4}/{5}}$ or as $\u03b5^{{2}/{3}}$, depending on whether the wells differ by a rank-one or a rank-two matrix, respectively. For the gradient and divergence-free two-well problem, we obtain analogous results, showing an $\u03b5^{{2}/{3}}$-scaling behavior in two dimensions whenever oscillations are energetically favored. These results follow by deriving matching upper and lower scaling bounds. The lower scaling bounds are established in a general $\\mathcal{A}$-free framework for incompatible two-well problems, which allows us to compute the excess energy and characterize boundary data which enforce oscillations. The upper scaling bounds are obtained by branching constructions which are adapted to the incompatible setting.",

A key ingredient of our analysis is a rigorous study of the weighted H\u00f6lder and Sobolev regularity of the Riesz potential, which enables accurate characterization of boundary singularities.

Equivalently, a graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation, that is, an acyclic orientation in which, for every directed path $v_0 \\rightarrow v_1 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow v_m$ with $m \\ge 2$, either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$, or, for all $1 \\le i < j \\le m$, there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$. In this work, we provide a comprehensive structural and algorithmic characterization of word-representable co-bipartite graphs, a class of graphs whose vertex set can be partitioned into two cliques.\n  This work unifies graph-theoretic and matrix-theoretic perspectives. We first establish that a co-bipartite graph is a circle graph if and only if it is a permutation graph, thereby deriving a minimal forbidden induced subgraph characterization for co-bipartite circle graphs. The central contribution then connects semi-transitivity with the circularly compatible ones property of binary matrices. In addition to the structural characterization, the paper introduces a linear-time recognition algorithm for semi-transitive co-bipartite graphs, utilizing Safe's matrix recognition framework.",

The text traces the historical evolution of zero from a positional marker in Babylonian systems to an independent algebraic entity in Indian mathematics, emphasizing its structural roles as a neutral and absorbing element. Parallel to this, the empty set is analyzed not as a void, but as an existing axiomatic object that serves as the foundation for constructing the number system in modern set theory. Furthermore, the operational utility of active nothing is demonstrated through its role in algebraic manipulation -- such as adding zero to reveal structure -- and in physical conservation laws. Finally, drawing on the philosophy of Nikolaus von Kues and the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, the paper interprets mathematics as a free, creative act of the human mind emerging ex nihilo.",

    "abstract": "The paper develops and analyzes a higher-order unfitted finite element method for the incompressible Stokes equations, which yields a strongly divergence-free velocity field up to the physical boundary. The method combines an isoparametric Scott--Vogelius velocity-pressure pair on a cut background mesh with a stabilized Nitsche/Lagrange multiplier formulation for imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions. We construct finite element spaces that admit robust numerical implementation using standard elementwise polynomial mappings and produce exactly divergence-free discrete velocities. The key components of the analysis are a new inf-sup stability result for the isoparametric Scott--Vogelius pair on unfitted meshes and a combined inf-sup stability result for the bilinear forms associated with the pressure and the Lagrange multiplier. The finite element formulation employs a higher-order Lagrange multiplier space, which ensures stability and mitigates the loss of pressure robustness typically associated with the weak enforcement of boundary conditions for the normal velocity component.\n  The paper provides a complete stability and convergence theory in two dimensions, accounting for the geometric errors introduced by the isoparametric approximation. The analysis demonstrates optimal-order velocity convergence in both the $H^1$ and $L^2$ norms and establishes optimal $H^1$-convergence and nearly optimal $L^2$-convergence of a post-processed pressure. Numerical experiments illustrate and confirm the theoretical findings.",

    "abstract": "We consider nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) for advection-diffusion processes which are augmented by an auxiliary parameter $\u03b4$ such that $\u03b4=0$ corresponds to linear advection-diffusion. We derive potentially non-perturbative series expansions in $\u03b4$ that provide a process to obtain the solution of the nonlinear PDE through solving a hierarchical system of linear, forced PDEs with the forcing terms dependent on solutions at lower orders in the hierarchy. We rigorously detail our approach for a particular deformation that interpolates between linear advection-diffusion and the canonical Burgers' equation modeling nonlinear advection. In this case, we prove that the series has infinite radius of convergence for arbitrary integrable initial data, analyze the cases of a Dirac-delta initial condition (IC) (i.e., the fundamental solution) in an infinite domain and arbitrary IC in a periodic domain, and demonstrate the approach to turbulent behavior in a scenario with periodic forcing. We then treat models of nonlinear diffusion involving the $p$-Laplacian operator, including generalizations of the Poisson equation in $1$ and $2$ dimensions, and the heat equation in $1+1$ dimensions. We detail series expansions for two different deformations of these equations about their linear (ordinary Laplacian) counterparts, providing numerical evidence for the convergence of the series outside of a perturbative regime and demonstrating that the rate and radius of convergence are affected by choice of deformation. Our results provide a rigorous foundation for using series expansion techniques to study nonlinear advection-diffusion PDEs, opening new pathways for analysis and potential applications for quantum-assisted computational fluid dynamics.",

A subset $D \\subseteq V$ is called a vertex-edge dominating set if, for every edge $uv \\in E$, at least one vertex from $D$ appears in $N_G[u] \\cup N_G[v]$; that is, $\\vert (N_G[u] \\cup N_G[v]) \\cap D\\vert \\geq 1$. Intuitively, a vertex-edge dominating set ensures that every edge, as well as all edges incident to either of its endpoints, is dominated by at least one vertex from the set. The \\textsc{Min-VEDS} problem asks for a vertex-edge dominating set of minimum size in a given graph. This problem is known to be NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we strengthen this hardness result by proving that the problem remains NP-complete for two specific subclasses of bipartite graphs: star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, it is known that the \\textsc{Min-VEDS} problem cannot be approximated within a factor of $(1 - \u03b5)\\ln |V|$ for any $\u03b5> 0$, unless $\\text{NP} \\subseteq \\text{DTIME}(|V|^{O(\\log \\log |V|)})$. We also prove that this inapproximability result holds even for star-convex and comb-convex bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum vertex-edge dominating set in convex bipartite graphs. A polynomial-time algorithm for this graph class was also proposed by B{\u00fc}y{\u00fc}k{\u00e7}olak et al.~\\cite{buyukccolak2025linear}, but we show that their algorithm has certain flaws by providing instances where it fails to produce an optimal solution.

    "abstract": "The class of word-representable graphs, introduced in connection with the study of the Perkins semigroup by Kitaev and Seif, has attracted significant attention in combinatorics and theoretical computer science due to its deep connections with graph orientations and combinatorics on words. A graph is word-representable if and only if it admits a semi-transitive orientation, which is an acyclic orientation such that for any directed path $v_0 \\rightarrow v_1 \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow v_m$ with $m \\ge 2$, either there is no arc between $v_0$ and $v_m$, or, for all $1 \\le i < j \\le m$, there exists an arc from $v_i$ to $v_j$. Split graphs, whose vertex set can be partitioned into a clique and an independent set, constitute a natural yet nontrivial subclass for studying word-representability. However, not all split graphs are semi-transitive, and the characterization of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for semi-transitive split graphs remains an open problem.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new matrix property called the $I$-circular property, which is closely related to the well-known $D$-circular property introduced by Safe. The $I$-circular property requires that both the rows of a matrix and the pairwise intersections of rows form circular intervals under some linear ordering of the columns. Using this property, we establish a direct connection between the structure of semi-transitive split graphs and the matrix representation of their adjacency relationships. Our main result is a complete forbidden submatrix characterization of the $I$-circular property, which in turn provides a characterization for semi-transitive split graphs in terms of minimal forbidden induced subgraphs.",

    "abstract": "We prove Hunter's conjecture on complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials. For even $n$ and every integer $k\\geq 1$, we show that under the constraint $\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2=1$ the global minimum of the even-degree polynomial $h_{2k}(a_1,\\dots,a_n)$ is attained precisely at the half-plus/half-minus vector and we compute the optimal value in closed form. The proof combines algebraic properties of $h_{2k}$ with the probabilistic representation $k!\\,h_k(a)=\\mathbb{E}(\\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i)^k$, where $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ are i.i.d. standard exponential random variables with density $e^{-x}1_{x>0}$ and a combinatorial identity. This viewpoint further yields sharp upper and lower bounds for $\\mathbb{E}|\\sum_{i=1}^n a_iX_i|^{q}$ under natural constraints on the coefficients, including the spherical constraint $\\sum a_i^2=1$ combined with the non-negative regime $a_i\\ge0$, or the centred regime $\\sum a_i=0$.

Fractional calculus provides nonlocal operators to capture hereditary dynamics. This survey connects modeling, analysis, and controller/game design for systems with memory. We unify notation for Caputo, Riemann-Liouville, and Grunwald-Letnikov derivatives and relate them to practical approximations, including diffusive (sum-of-exponentials) state augmentation and frequency-domain realizations (e.g., Oustaloup). We review fractional extensions of the calculus of variations and the Pontryagin maximum principle, and dynamic-programming formulations with memory, including path-dependent HJB for optimal control and HJI for zero-sum games. We cover design tools such as LQR, MPC, and fractional-order PID, as well as fractional differential games with Nash, Stackelberg, and minimax equilibria. Computational approaches are compared across time-domain schemes, frequency-domain approximations, and diffusive augmentations, highlighting accuracy-complexity trade-offs and remedies for the curse of history (windowing and sum-of-exponentials). We conclude with applications and open problems on equilibria with memory, Isaacs-type conditions, constraint handling, and scalable solvers.",

    "abstract": "A generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) in Banach space consists of $N>1$ optimal control problems with couplings in both the objective functions and, most importantly, in the feasible sets. We address the existence of equilibria for convex GNEPs in Banach space. We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or PDE-constrained settings, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps. We also extend Rosen's uniqueness condition to Banach spaces using a multiplier bias framework. Additionally, we present a geometric counterpart to our analytic framework using preference maps. This geometric is intended as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, the analytic theory developed in the main body of the paper.",

Invariant foliations can be fitted to data that either fill the phase space or cluster about an invariant manifold. Invariant foliations can be fitted to a single trajectory or multiple trajectories. Over and underfitting are eliminated by appropriately choosing a function representation and its hyperparameters, such as polynomial orders. The paper extends invariant foliations to forced and parameter dependent systems. It is assumed that forcing is provided by a volume preserving map, and therefore the forcing can be periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic. The method utilises full trajectories, hence it is able to predict long-term dynamics accurately. We take into account if a forced system is reducible to an autonomous system about a steady state, similar to how Floquet theory guarantees reducibility for periodically forced systems. In order to find an invariant manifold, multiple invariant foliations are calculated in the neighbourhood of the invariant manifold. Some of the invariant foliations can be linear, while others nonlinear but only defined in a small neighbourhood of an invariant manifold, which reduces the number of parameters to be identified. An invariant manifold is recovered as the zero level set of one or more of the foliations. To interpret the results, the identified mathematical models are transformed to a canonical form and instantaneous frequency and damping information are calculated.",

The aim of this article is to understand when the fundamental group of a graph of groups has the f.g.i.p. Our main results are general criteria for the f.g.i.p. in graphs of groups which depend on properties of the vertex groups, properties of certain double cosets of the edge groups and the structure of the underlying graph. For acylindrical graphs of groups, we also obtain criteria for the strong f.g.i.p. (s.f.g.i.p.). Our results generalise classical results due to Burns and Cohen on the f.g.i.p. for amalgamated free products and HNN extensions. As a concrete application, we show that a graph of locally quasi-convex hyperbolic groups with virtually $\\mathbb{Z}$ edge groups (for instance, a generalised Baumslag--Solitar group) has the f.g.i.p. if and only if it does not contain $F_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}$ as a subgroup. In addition, we show that this condition is decidable. The main tools we use are the explicit constructions of pullbacks of immersions into a graph of group, obtained by the authors in a previous paper, and a technical condition on coset interactions, introduced in this paper.",

Earlier approaches have produced numerous criteria for matchability and unmatchability, but have offered little structural insight. In this paper, we develop parallel structure theorems which characterize unmatchable pairs in both abelian groups and field extensions. Our framework reveals analogous obstructions to matchability: nearly periodic decompositions of sets in the group setting correspond to decompositions of subspaces involving translates of simple extensions in the linear setting. This perspective not only recovers previously known results through short proofs, but also leads to new matching criteria and guarantees the existence of nontrivial unmatchable pairs.",

Given our initial state, the fluctuations are given by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process whose characteristic operators are the Laplacian and gradient operators. The domains of these operators include functions with boundary conditions that depend on the hydrodynamic profile. A central ingredient in our analysis is the derivation of sharp bounds on the space and space-time $v$-functions of arbitrary degree for the centered occupation variables.

As the total wavefield is non-quasi-periodic, effective truncation techniques are pursued for high-accuracy numerical solvers. We adopt the Green's function for the background periodic structure to construct a boundary integral equation (BIE) on an artificial curve enclosing the perturbation. It serves as a transparent boundary condition (TBC) to truncate the unbounded domain. We develop efficient algorithms to compute such background Green's functions based on the Floquet-Bloch transform and its inverse. Spectrally accurate quadrature rules are developed to discretize the BIE-based TBC. Effective algorithms based on leap and pullback procedures are further developed to compute the total wavefield everywhere in the structure. A number of numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new solver. They exhibit that our method for the non-quasi-periodic problem has a time complexity that is even comparable to that of a single quasi-periodic problem.",

To overcome this, we introduce a framework of very weak solutions based on regularization techniques and the theory of moderate nets. Existence of very weak solutions is established under minimal regularity assumptions.

Braided near-group categories were fully classified by Siehler and Thornton. In this paper, we study the structure of braided simple extensions of a braided finite tensor category $\\mathcal{D}$ in general, and specifically when $\\mathcal{D}$ is pointed. In particular, we classify non-degenerate braided non-semisimple near-group categories, and prove that any braided non-semisimple near-group category $\\mathcal{C}$ is \"an extension\" of a non-degenerate braided non-semisimple near-group category by $Rep(G)$, where $G$ is the Picard group of a \"canonical\" symmetric subcategory of $\\mathcal{C}$.",

Under a spatial symmetry assumption in the transverse variables $x_2$ and $x_3$, the problem reduces to a one-dimensional spatial slab $x_1 \\in [0,1]$ while retaining full three-dimensional momentum dependence. For non-negative inflow boundary conditions prescribed at $x_1=0$ and $x_1=1$, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary solution in a weighted $L^1_p L^\\infty_{x_1}$ framework, together with exponential decay in momentum.\n  Our analysis treats the full slab domain and does not rely on any smallness assumption on the slab width. We establish sharp coercivity and continuity estimates for the collision frequency, together with weighted convolution and pointwise bounds for the nonlinear gain term. These estimates generate and propagate a $(-\u0394_p)^{-1}$-type regularity within the solution framework, which plays a crucial role in the existence and uniqueness argument. In addition, we obtain uniform weighted integrability of the solution over arbitrary two-dimensional hyperplanes through the origin. This hyperplane estimate is derived as a genuinely a posteriori regularity property, without imposing any a priori hyperplane bounds, and follows from a Lorentz-invariant geometric reduction.",

As a consequence, the canonical form under congruence of the elements of this subset can be considered the generic canonical form under congruence of complex $n\\times n$ matrices. Second, we prove that the set of $n\\times n$ complex matrices is the union of the closures of certain $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor+1$ open subsets and that, for each of these subsets, its elements have a very specific canonical form under $^*$congruence, which is uniquely determined up to the values of some parameters. As a consequence, the $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor+1$ canonical forms under $^*$congruence of the elements of each of these subsets can be considered the generic canonical forms under $^*$congruence of complex $n\\times n$ matrices. So, there is only one generic canonical form under congruence whereas the number of generic canonical forms under $^*$congruence is $\\lfloor n/2\\rfloor+1$ instead, which reveals a strong dichotomy between the relations of congruence and $^*$congruence with respect to generic structures. In other words, we determine in this paper the generic matrix representations of $n\\times n$ bilinear and sesquilinear forms in $\\mathbb{C}^n \\times \\mathbb{C}^n$.",

Here, we study condensers of maze-like structure and compute their capacity by means of a high-order $hp$- finite element method. We compare these numerical results to the estimates given by the quasihyperbolic length and perimeter of the compact set. In particular, we consider the behaviour of these value pairs, numerical results and estimates, when the structure parameters vary and the walls of the maze approach the compact set.

    "title": "Vertical Heterogeneous Networks Beyond 5G: CoMP Coverage Enhancement and Optimization",
    "abstract": "Low-altitude wireless networks are increasingly vital for the low-altitude economy, enabling wireless coverage in high-mobility and hard-to-reach environments. However, providing reliable connectivity to sparsely distributed aerial users in dynamic three-dimensional (3D) spaces remains a significant challenge. This paper investigates downlink coverage enhancement in vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets) beyond 5G, where uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate as emerging aerial base stations (ABSs) alongside legacy terrestrial base stations (TBSs). To improve coverage performance, we propose a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission framework that enables joint transmission from ABSs and TBSs. This approach mitigates the limitations of non-uniform user distributions and enhances reliability for sparse aerial users. Two UAV deployment strategies are considered: \\textit{i)} random UAV placement, analyzed using stochastic geometry to derive closed-form coverage expressions, and \\textit{ii)} optimized UAV placement using a coverage-aware weighted $K$-means clustering algorithm to maximize cooperative coverage in underserved areas. Theoretical analyses and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed CoMP-enabled VHetNet significantly improves downlink coverage probability, particularly in scenarios with sparse aerial users. These findings highlight the potential of intelligent UAV coordination and geometry-aware deployment to enable robust, adaptive connectivity in low-altitude wireless networks.",

In contrast to the ergodicity results of Fehrman, Gess, and Gvalani arXiv:2206.14789, our analysis accommodates irregular, square-root type noise coefficients. For such irregular coefficients, we prove that the law of the classical Dean--Kawasaki equation converges exponentially fast to equilibrium, while for the porous medium type Dean--Kawasaki equation, the convergence occurs at a polynomial rate. Furthermore, we obtain a regularization by noise effect, showing that the polynomial convergence rate improves to an exponential one whenever the noise coefficient is sufficiently regular, including the case of conservative multiplicative linear noise. Our approach relies on establishing a supercontraction property in a suitably weighted Lebesgue space, achieved through a refined doubling of variables argument.

In 2018, the concept of forts was introduced to provide a set covering characterization of zero forcing sets. Since then, forts have been integrated into integer programming models for zero forcing and have been used to yield bounds on the zero forcing number. In 2025, researchers explored the combinatorial question of how many minimal forts a graph can have. They demonstrated that the number of minimal forts in a graph with an order of at least six is strictly less than Sperner's bound. Moreover, the authors derived an explicit formula for the number of minimal forts in path, cycle, and spider graphs. For example, the number of minimal forts in a path graph aligns with the Padovan sequence, and thus exhibits exponential growth. In this article, we demonstrate that no tree with an order of $n$ can have fewer than $n/3$ minimal forts. Additionally, we provide a characterization of the trees that possess exactly $n/3$ minimal forts. We conjecture that the $n/3$ bound is valid for all graphs of order $n$.

    "abstract": "We revisit the planar Skorokhod embedding problem introduced by Gross and developed further by Boudabra-Markowsky, and we place it in a fully variational framework. For a centered probability measure $\u03bc$ with finite second moment, we show that Gross' $\u03bc$ -domain $U_\u03bc^{G}$ uniquely minimizes the area among all simply connected $\u03bc$ -domains. Equivalently, $U_\u03bc^{G}$ minimizes a natural $H^{\\frac{1}{2}}$-type boundary energy, providing an optimal design interpretation of the planar Skorokhod embedding problem. The proof relies on the Fourier characterization of fractional Sobolev spaces on the circle, symmetric decreasing rearrangement of the quantile of $\u03bc$ , and a one-dimensional fractional $P\u00f3lya-Szeg\u0151$ inequality. Within the Schlicht class, we obtain a sharp model case: under a natural normalization of the quantile, the Gross area is uniquely minimized by the shifted arcsine distribution. This identifies the Gross domain of the arcsine law as the extremal Schlicht solution to the planar Skorokhod embedding problem. In the second part of the paper we return to Brownian symmetrization. Using the optimality of $U_\u03bc^{G}$, we prove that Brownian symmetrization is area-nonincreasing and, in fact, dominates Steiner symmetrization in this regard. We then quantify the ratio $$\u03c1(U):=\\frac{\\mathcal{A}(U_\u03bc^{G})}{\\mathcal{A}(U)},$$showing that, among simply connected domains of fixed area, every value in $(0,1]$ is attained. A family of thin rectangles provides a striking example where the associated one-dimensional laws collapse to a Dirac mass in $L^{2}$ while the Gross domain does not shrink, illustrating the genuinely fractional nature of the underlying $H^{\\frac{1}{2}}$-geometry. Altogether, our results clarify the geometric content of the planar Skorokhod embedding and open a systematic program of \"optimal design\" via Brownian symmetrization.",

    "abstract": "We present a unified operator-theoretic framework for constructing deterministic KdV soliton gases and step-type KdV solutions. Starting from Dyson's determinantal formula, we obtain a broad class of reflectionless solutions and describe their basic spectral and analytic properties, including their interpretation as deterministic soliton gases. We then introduce a continuous binary Darboux transformation that acts directly on the scattering data and generates general step-type solutions, with particular emphasis on reflectionless hydraulic-jump-type profiles modelling a soliton condensate on the left and vacuum on the right. The paper is methodological in nature: our goal is not to develop a full kinetic or probabilistic theory, but to show how classical tools from spectral and scattering theory can be combined into a conceptually simple framework that accommodates both reflectionless and non-reflectionless soliton gas configurations, including step-like backgrounds.",

We derive precise spectral properties of the associated linearized operators and prove a Vakhitov-Kolokolov (VK) type stability criterion that completely characterizes spectral stability. Furthermore, we determine the sharp exponential decay rate of the traveling waves and demonstrate that it matches the decay rate of the Green's function for the linearized operator. Our analysis extends to fourth-order nonlinear Schrodinger equations, for which we establish analogous existence and stability results. The theoretical findings are complemented by numerical computations that verify the stability predictions and reveal the transition from unstable to stable regimes as the wavespeed varies. These results provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding wave propagation phenomena in structural mechanics, particularly suspension bridge models.",

Our analysis is based on quantitative propagation of smallness estimates for the free solution. Furthermore, when $d\\in \\{1,2,3\\},$ we ensure the local null controllability for the nonlinear system via a fixed-point argument.

    "abstract": "Future wireless networks must support real-time, data-driven cyber-physical systems in which communication is tightly coupled with sensing, inference, control, and decision-making. Traditional communication paradigms centered on accuracy, throughput, and latency are increasingly inadequate for these systems, where the value of information depends on its semantic relevance to a specific task. This paper provides a unified exposition of the progression from classical distortion-based frameworks, through information freshness metrics such as the Age of Information (AoI) and its variants, to the emerging paradigm of goal-oriented semantics-aware communication. We organize and systematize existing semantics-aware metrics, including content- and version-aware measures, context-dependent distortion formulations, and history-dependent error persistence metrics that capture lasting impact and urgency. Within this framework, we highlight how these metrics address the limitations of purely accuracy- or freshness-centric designs, and how they collectively enable the selective generation and transmission of only task-relevant information. We further review analytical tools based on Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization methods that have been employed to characterize optimal or near-optimal timing and scheduling policies under semantic performance criteria and communication constraints. By synthesizing these developments into a coherent framework, the paper clarifies the design principles underlying goal-oriented, semantics-aware communication systems. It illustrates how they can significantly improve efficiency, reliability, and task performance. The presented perspective aims to serve as a bridge between information-theoretic, control-theoretic, and networking viewpoints, and to guide the design of semantic communication architectures for 6G and beyond.",

However, corresponding non-asymptotic results for high-dimensional non-Gaussian and nonlinear functional time series, as well as for spectral density function estimation, are largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce novel functional dependence measures, based on which we establish systematic non-asymptotic concentration bounds for estimates of (auto)covariance and spectral density functions in high-dimensional and non-Gaussian settings. We then illustrate the usefulness of our convergence results through two applications to dynamic functional principal component analysis and sparse spectral density function estimation. To handle the practical scenario where curves are discretely observed with errors, we further develop convergence rates of the corresponding estimates obtained via a nonparametric smoothing method.

    "title": "On infinitesimal deformations of singular varieties I",
    "abstract": "The deformation theory of singular varieties plays a central role in understanding the geometry and moduli of algebraic varieties. For a variety $X$ with possibly singular points, the space of first-order infinitesimal deformations is given by \\( T^1_X = \\operatorname{Ext}^1_{\\mathcal{O}_X}(\u03a9_X, \\mathcal{O}_X), \\) which measures the Zariski tangent space to the deformation functor of $X$. When $T^1_X = 0$, the variety is said to be \\emph{rigid}; otherwise, nonzero elements of $T^1_X$ correspond to nontrivial first-order deformations. We investigate the structure of $T^1_X$ for singular varieties and provide cohomological and geometric criteria ensuring non-rigidity. In particular, we show that if the sheaf of tangent fields $T_X$ possesses nonvanishing cohomology $H^1(X, T_X)$ or if the local contributions $\\mathcal{E}xt^1(\u03a9_X, \\mathcal{O}_X)$ are supported on a positive-dimensional singular locus, then $T^1_X \\neq 0$. For hypersurface singularities $X = \\{ f = 0 \\} \\subset \\mathbb{C}^{n+1}$, we recover the Jacobian criterion, \\[ T^1_X \\cong \\frac{\\mathbb{C}[x_0, \\dots, x_n]}{(f, \\partial f / \\partial x_0, \\dots, \\partial f / \\partial x_n)}, \\] where the positivity of the Tjurina number $\u03c4(X)$ characterizes the existence of nontrivial deformations. Moreover, non-rigidity arises when $X$ % appears as a cone over a projectively nonrigid variety. These criteria provide effective tools for detecting non-rigidity in both local and global settings, linking the vanishing of Ext and cohomology groups to the deformation behavior of singularities. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between singularity theory, moduli, and the rigidity properties of algebraic varieties.",

    "abstract": "This paper considers stochastic convex optimization problems with smooth functional constraints arising in constrained estimation and robust signal recovery. We operate in the high-dimensional and highly-constrained setting, where oracle access is restricted to one or a few objective and constraint gradients per-iteration, as in streaming or online estimation. Existing approaches to solve such problems are based on either the stochastic primal-dual or stochastic subgradient methods, and require globally Lipschitz continuous constraint functions. In this work, we develop a hinge-proximal framework that utilizes an exact penalty reformulation to yield updates involving only one linearized constraint (and hence accessing one constraint gradient) per-iteration. The updates also admit a novel hinge-proximal three-point inequality relying on smoothness rather than global Lipschitz continuity of the constraint functions. The framework leads to three algorithms: a baseline hinge-proximal SGD (HPS), a variance-reduced HPS version for finite-sum settings, and a nested HPS version whose performance depends on a geometric regularity constant of the constraint region rather than explicitly on the number of constraints, while achieving near-SGD sample complexity. The superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a robust regression problem with noisy features, representative of errors-in-variables estimation.",

Whether the set of all representations forms a regular language or not is one of the most important questions that can be asked of such a system. This question was investigated in a 1998 article by Hollander. Central to his analysis is a property linking positional numeration systems and R\u00e9nyi numeration systems, which use a real base to represent real numbers. However, this link only exists when the initial numeration system has a dominant root, which is not a necessary condition for regularity. In this article, we show a more general link between positional numeration systems and alternate base numeration systems, a family generalizing R\u00e9nyi systems. We then take advantage of this link to provide a full characterization of those numeration systems that generate a regular language. We also discuss the effectiveness of our method, and comment Hollander's results and conjecture in the light of ours.",

The new bound depends on a degree-$k$ polynomial which can be chosen freely, so one needs to make a good choice of the polynomial to obtain as strong a bound as possible. We thus propose linear programming methods to optimize it. We also investigate the implications of the new bound for the quantum distance chromatic number, showing that it is sharp for some classes of graphs. Finally, we extend the Hoffman bound to the distance setting of the vector chromatic number. Our results extend and unify several previous bounds in the literature.",

The factor D2 vanishes precisely when v1 and v2 have the same norm and are orthogonal as vectors in R^8, giving a concrete polynomial criterion for nontrivial zero divisors. After normalizing by the norm, the zero divisor set becomes diffeomorphic to the Stiefel manifold V2(R^8) of orthonormal 2-frames, which we interpret as a \"zero divisor frame bundle\". On a suitable 3-dimensional linear slice, this set is modeled by a quadratic double cone, a structure we confirm by numerical experiments and 3-dimensional visualization. Finally, we approximate the Levi-Civita connection induced from the ambient Euclidean metric and compute parallel transport along a great-circle loop in V2(R^8); projecting the holonomy to a torus of base and fiber angles produces a curve of essentially (1,1) type.

The transformation yields a new process whose diffusion component has a square-root structure and whose drift becomes nonlinear. A critical reassessment of earlier studies using similar transformations reveals fundamental errors in model specification and derivations. To address this, we introduce a generalized Girsanov change of measure that adjusts the drift of the transformed process. Under the resulting equivalent measure, the dynamics reduce to the classical Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model. Using the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem, we establish existence, uniqueness, and positivity of solutions, and show that the combined transformation and measure change is valid only under specific parameter restrictions, including those most relevant for financial applications. The CIR representation allows us to exploit known results on stationary distributions, moments, and boundary behavior. Under an additional coefficient relationship, the process can be further linked to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework, yielding explicit distributional properties under the equivalent measure. Finally, since standard martingale conditions are not applicable, we prove directly that the associated Radon-Nikodym derivative is a true martingale by invoking a recent criterion based on Feller's explosion test and boundary classification.",

The jump kernel of $X$ is of the form $J(x,y)={\\cal B}(x,y)|x-y|^{-d-\u03b1}$, $\u03b1\\in (0,2)$, where the function ${\\cal B}(x,y)$ decays to 0 at the boundary and is described in terms of two $O$-regularly varying functions and one slowly varying function. Under the conditions, introduced in \\cite{CKSV24}, on ${\\cal B}(x,y)$ and on the killing potential $\u03ba$, we establish sharp two-sided estimates on the heat kernel of $X$: in Lipschitz sets when $X$ is conservative, and in $C^{1,1}$ open sets for the killed process.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the notion of Gaussian domination for the spin $O(N)$ model on general finite graphs. We begin by proving a general inequality for spin correlations under the assumption of Gaussian domination, which directly implies long-range order at low temperatures for graphs with bounded Green's function. Usually, Gaussian domination is proved via reflection positivity, but this requires strict symmetries and is very rigid. In this article we also probe the boundaries of elementary methods for proving Gaussian domination. Although we did not find a way to get uniform bounds, we do offer new views for Gaussian domination at low and high temperatures for finite graphs, and a few counterexamples illustrating the interplay between correlation estimates and Gaussian domination and how local changes in the graph structure can affect the presence of Gaussian domination.",

Our results extend to estimating additional parameters of the initial-boundary value problem, such as the length of the interval and/or the time required for the solution to achieve a specific state. Our approach relies on the asymptotic solution of an integral equation: The formulation of this integral equation is based on the solution of the direct problem via the Fokas method; the solution of this equation is achieved through the asymptotic evaluation of the associated integrals which yield an effective approximate solution, supported by numerical verifications. We apply these approximations to well-established problems in soil science and we compare our results with existing ones, displaying clear improvement.",

    "abstract": "Given a compact metric graph $\u0393$ and the Laplacian $\u0394_\u0393$ coupled with standard (Kirchhoff) vertex conditions, solutions to fractional elliptic partial differential equations of the form $(\u03ba^2 - \u0394_\u0393)^{\u03b1/2}u=f$ on $\u0393$ exhibit a distinctive regularity structure: even-order derivatives are continuous across vertices, while odd-order derivatives may be discontinuous. This non-standard smoothness property precludes the direct application of classical tools from real functional analysis. Because of this, we introduce and systematically study new families of Sobolev spaces tailored to this setting. We define these spaces, denoted $W^{\u03b1,p}(\u0393)$ and $H^\u03b1(\u0393)$, to respect the continuity constraints on even-order derivatives at vertices, while permitting discontinuities in odd-order derivatives. We establish their fundamental properties, including characterizations, embedding theorems into H\u00f6lder and Lebesgue spaces, and compactness results. A central contribution in this investigation is the derivation of uniform bounds on the supremum norm of eigenfunctions for a class of Laplacians on metric graphs, a result of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that these spaces provide a natural framework for analyzing the regularity of solutions to fractional elliptic PDEs and SPDEs driven by Gaussian white noise on metric graphs, in particular, establishing a general characterization of the domain of the fractional powers of $(\u03ba^2-\u0394_\u0393)$ and $(\u03ba^2-\\nabla(a\\nabla))$ in terms of the Sobolev spaces we introduce, thereby extending all previously known characterizations in the literature, and improving the regularity results previously obtained to their sharp counterparts (with general fractional powers). We also show that these spaces are fundamental to the characterization of Gaussian free fields on metric graphs.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a unified information-theoretic framework for artificial-intelligence (AI)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), where a learning component with limited representational capacity is embedded within the transceiver loop. The study introduces the concept of an AI capacity budget to quantify how the finite ability of a learning model constrains joint communication and sensing performance. Under this framework, the paper derives both converse (upper) and achievability (lower) bounds that define the achievable rate-sensing region. For Gaussian channels, the effect of limited learning capacity is shown to behave as an equivalent additive noise, allowing simple analytical expressions for the resulting communication rate and sensing distortion. The theory is then extended to Rayleigh and Rician fading as well as to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems through new matrix inequalities and a constructive mapping between AI capacity and effective noise covariance. Resource allocation between sensing and communication is optimized under this learning constraint, yielding closed-form conditions in the Gaussian case. A general learning-information trade-off law is also established, linking the representational power of the learning module to the achievable performance frontier. Finally, a practical variational training procedure is proposed to enforce the capacity constraint and to guide empirical evaluation. The derived scaling laws provide quantitative insight for co-designing model size, waveform, and hardware in next-generation ISAC systems.",

This structure induces a family of transported RKHS geometries in which classical orthogonal polynomial estimators, kernel estimators, and spectral smoothing methods arise as projections onto transported eigenfunction systems. Our main contribution is a Spectral Equivariance Theorem showing that the eigenfunctions of any transported kernel are obtained by unitary transport of the base eigenfunctions. As a consequence, orthogonal polynomial estimators are equivariant under geometric deformation, kernel estimators correspond to soft spectral filtering in a twin space, and minimax rates and bias--variance tradeoffs are invariant under transport. We provide examples based on Hermite and Legendre polynomials, affine and Gaussian groups, and illustrate the effectiveness of twin transport for adaptive and multimodal estimation. The framework reveals a deep connection between group actions, RKHS geometry, and spectral nonparametrics, offering a unified perspective that encompasses kernel smoothing, orthogonal series, splines, and multiscale methods.",

    "abstract": "Normal networks are an important class of phylogenetic networks that have compelling mathematical properties which align with intuition about inference from genetic data. While tools enabling widespread use of phylogenetic networks in the biological literature are still under mathematical, statistical, and computational development, many such results are being assembled, and in particular for normal phylogenetic networks. For instance, it has been shown that binary normal networks can be reconstructed from the sets of three- and four-leaf rooted phylogenetic trees that they display. It is also known that one can reconstruct particular subclasses of normal networks from just the displayed rooted triples. This applies, for instance, to rooted binary phylogenetic trees and to binary level-$1$ normal networks. In this paper we address the question of how much of the class of binary normal networks can be reconstructed from just the rooted triples that they display. We find that all except those with substructures that we call ``near-sibling reticulations'' and ``near-stack reticulations'' can be reconstructed just from their rooted triples. This goes some way to answering the natural question of how much information can be extracted from a set of displayed rooted triples, which are arguably the simplest substructure that one may hope for in a phylogenetic object.",

We then develop a computationally tractable scheme and propose a novel Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler ($q$-HMC). The proposed $q$-HMC method is shown to satisfy the detailed balance principle. Numerical experiments on distributions with explicit potential functions demonstrate its efficacy, particularly in exploring stiff energy landscapes. This method is also applied to draw samples from the Bayesian posterior distribution of inverse problems. The numerical test for the posterior distribution with stiff potential further shows the advantage of $q$-HMC. And it yields the identical computational implementation process to that of HMC when used to deal with functional reconstruction problems.",

Our primary focus is on examining the asymptotic behaviors of the principal eigenvalue with respect to large advection and small or large diffusion rates. We subsequently apply these results to a nonlinear age-structured model, providing a better understanding of how diffusion and advection influence the spatial distribution of species. Among other ingredients, our approach involves constructing various types of super- and sub-solutions to tackle the novel challenges posed by the nonlocal terms in the problems under consideration.",

    "abstract": "The use of momentum in stochastic optimization algorithms has shown empirical success across a range of machine learning tasks. Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum. Experimental results on training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks verify our theoretical observations.",

Building on the geometric framework developed by Bressan and Chen for quasilinear second-order wave equations, we prove that the solution retains $C^k$ regularity away from a finite number of piecewise $C^{k-1}$ characteristic curves. Furthermore, we provide a description of the solution behavior in the vicinity of these curves.

Given a group $\\mathcal{G}$ with orbits $(\\mathcal{O}_i)_{i=1}^k$, we analyse three canonical orbit kernels: namely the Gibbs $(G)$, Metropolis-Hastings $(M)$, and Barker $(B)$ kernels, as well as their multiplicative sandwiches $QPQ$ and the additive mixtures $\\frac{1}{2}(P+Q)$ where $Q\\in\\{G,M,B\\}$.

We give a direct and simple proof of Pythagorean identity under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, showing that $GPG$ arises naturally as an information projection of $P$ onto the set of $G$-invariant transition matrices. For a given $P$, we characterise the optimal choice of $G$ with a fixed number of orbits that minimises the one-step KL divergence to stationarity. Analogously, for a given $G$, we characterise the optimal choice of $P$ and give sufficient conditions under which $GPG = \u03a0$. We further show that alternating projections over multiple group actions converge at a rate governed by the singular values of an overlap matrix, and that in structured cases, this yields exact sampling where the number of group actions grows logarithmically with the size of the state space. Based on the theory, we propose two heuristics to tune $G$ in practice.

The HDG method is implemented using GPU-tailored algorithms in which local element degrees of freedom are eliminated in parallel, and the globally condensed system is assembled directly on the device using dense-block operations. The global matrix is stored in a block format that reflects the natural HDG structure, enabling all iterative solver kernels to be executed with strided batched dense matrix-vector multiplications. This implementation avoids sparse data structures, increases arithmetic intensity, and sustains high memory throughput across a range of meshes and polynomial orders. The nonlinear solver combines Newton's method with preconditioned GMRES, integrating scalable preconditioners such as block-Jacobi, additive Schwarz domain decomposition, and polynomial smoothers. All preconditioners are implemented in batched form with architecture-aware optimizations--including dense linear algebra kernels, memory-coalesced vector operations, and shared-memory acceleration--to minimize memory traffic and maximize parallel occupancy. Comprehensive studies are conducted for a variety of PDEs (including Poisson equation, Burgers equation, linear and nonlinear elasticity, Euler equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations) using structured and unstructured meshes with different element types and polynomial orders on both NVIDIA and AMD GPU architectures.",

    "abstract": "This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.",

We show that gAEGD preserves unconditional energy stability, remains robust to step-size selection, and exhibits a two-phase adaptive dynamic: the effective step size first adjusts automatically and then stabilizes within a regime that ensures decay of the objective function values. We establish an optimal convergence rate of $O(\\frac{1}{k})$ for attaining an $\u03b5$-stationary point, and further derive improved convergence rates for the objective gap under a local Kurdyka-\u0141ojasiewicz (KL) condition.

In the null-recurrent regime, three distinct behaviors arise. Points satisfying certain combinatorial conditions (in particular, this class is generic in the measure-theoretic sense) exhibit fractional Poisson limits, whereas periodic points yield compound fractional Poisson limits. For all remaining points, we describe the full family of possible limit laws, each Pareto-dominated. This classification is sharp: every limit behavior in this family can be realized by an explicit system.

The formulation is guided by two principal objectives: firstly, to achieve equitable work load distribution commensurate with employee efficiency, and secondly, to minimize overall project costs by accounting for task difficulty and individual proficiency. Furthermore, the approach incorporates adaptive updates to efficiency parameters based on observed performance, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. Empirical evaluation using simulated datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over conventional assignment strategies in terms of both workload fairness and cost reduction.

    "abstract": "Gibbs states play a central role in quantum statistical mechanics as the standard description of thermal equilibrium. Traditionally, their use is justified either by a heuristic, a posteriori reasoning, or by derivations based on notions of typicality or passivity. In this work, we show that Gibbs states are completely characterized by assuming dynamical stability of the system itself and of the system in weak contact with an arbitrary environment. This builds on and strengthens a result by Frigerio, Gorini, and Verri (1986), who derived Gibbs states from dynamical stability using an additional assumption that they referred to as the \"zeroth law of thermodynamics\", as it concerns a nested dynamical stability of a triple of systems. We prove that this zeroth law is redundant and that an environment consisting solely of harmonic oscillators is sufficient to single out Gibbs states as the only dynamically stable states.",

When the surface is geometrically infinite, the situation is more complex, and the presence of possible non-closed and non-dense orbits, called irregular orbits, complicates the description of minimal sets. In this text, we will show that such an orbit is recurrent, or its closure is non-$h_{\\mathbb{R}}$ minimal.

The neural scaling law describes how the cross entropy rate of a foundation model -- such as a large language model -- changes with respect to the amount of training tokens, parameters, and compute. By contrast, Zipf's law posits that the distribution of tokens exhibits a power law tail. Whereas similar claims have been made in more specific settings, we show that the neural scaling law is a consequence of Zipf's law under certain broad assumptions that we reveal systematically. The derivation steps are as follows: We derive Heaps' law on the vocabulary growth from Zipf's law, Hilberg's hypothesis on the entropy scaling from Heaps' law, and the neural scaling from Hilberg's hypothesis. We illustrate these inference steps by a toy example of the Santa Fe process that satisfies all the four statistical laws.",

We investigate its basic properties. We compute the peripheral hyper-Wiener index of the cartesian product and trees. In particular, we get an explicit formula for the case of the hypercubes. We also give lower and upper bounds on PW(G) and PWW(G) in terms of the order, size, diameter and the number of peripheral vertices.

This result was surprising since the measure algebra $M(G)$ is Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable, which might lead one to guess that $B(G)$ should be operator Connes-amenable if and only if $G$ is amenable. This leads to the question: for which groups $G$ is $B(G)$ operator Connes-amenable? We make progress on this problem by giving the first examples of groups where $B(G)$ is known to not be operator Connes-amenable. More specifically, we show that $B(G)$ is not operator Connes-amenable when $G$ is a non-compact locally compact group with property (T) and finite almost periodic compactification, or when $G$ is a discrete group without the factorization property. This refutes the suggestion of Dales that $B(G)$ might be operator Connes-amenable for every locally compact group.",

    "abstract": "We study memory-type null controllability for linear parabolic equations with hereditary terms and time-dependent control regions. In contrast with classical null controllability, systems with memory require the simultaneous annihilation of both the state and the accumulated memory at the terminal time in order to prevent post-control reactivation of the dynamics.\n  Assuming that the memory kernel is a finite sum of exponentials, we reformulate the problem as a coupled parabolic--ODE system. Within this framework, we introduce a geometric condition on moving control regions, referred to as the Memory Geometric Control Condition (MGCC), which requires that every spatial point be visited by the control region during the control horizon.\n  Under MGCC, we establish an augmented observability inequality for the adjoint system by means of a flow-adapted Carleman estimate. This observability result, which explicitly accounts for the memory variables, allows us to derive memory-type null controllability via the Hilbert Uniqueness Method. We also discuss the limitations of the approach and explain why full geometric necessity results remain out of reach in the presence of memory effects.\n  The analysis provides a rigorous sufficient geometric condition for memory-type null controllability of parabolic equations with exponential memory kernels and moving controls.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel accelerated fixed-point-based framework using delayed inexact oracles to approximate a fixed point of a nonexpansive operator (or equivalently, a root of a co-coercive operator), a central problem in scientific computing. Our approach leverages both Nesterov's acceleration technique and the Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) iteration, while accounting for delayed inexact oracles, a key mechanism in asynchronous algorithms. We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay. Finally, we verify our algorithms and theoretical results through two numerical examples on both matrix game and shallow neural network training problems.",
