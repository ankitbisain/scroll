    "abstract": "We study boundary conditions for elliptic operators on non-compact manifolds with boundary via uniform K-homology, a version of K-homology sensitive to the large-scale geometry of the manifold. To that end, we develop the theory of relative uniform K-homology. We show that boundary conditions for uniformly elliptic differential operators define classes in the relative and non-relative uniform K-homology of the manifold, depending on the assumed regularity of the boundary condition. Moreover, we define and study a relative index map on relative uniform K-homology that combines uniform coarse information on the interior with secondary information on the boundary. As an application, we compute that on a spin manifold with product structure and uniformly positive scalar curvature on the boundary the image of the relative uniform K-homology class of the Dirac operator under this relative index map is closely connected to a uniform version of the higher $\u03c1$-invariant of the boundary. In particular, a delocalized APS-index theorem of Piazza and Schick is proved in the uniform setting.",

    "abstract": "We formulate a Mayer--Vietoris/\u010cech viewpoint on $K$-theory for crossed products by discrete quantum groups, emphasizing how local-to-global gluing data interacts with quantum-group coefficients. Starting from a $G$-equivariant ideal cover and the associated Mayer--Vietoris six-term exact sequence, we package the resulting $K$-theoretic computation into a \u010cech-type spectral sequence whose $E^1$-page is explicitly described by iterated intersections. We then introduce a minimal ``twisted'' gluing mechanism controlled by a $\\mathbb Z/2$-valued \u010cech $2$-cocycle and an involutive automorphism of the coefficient algebra. Under a Kirchberg--UCT hypothesis on the quantum-group crossed-product coefficient, the twist produces a nontrivial differential $d_2$ identified as $\\varphi_*-\\mathrm{id}$ on coefficient $K$-theory. In a concrete regime where the coefficient $K$-groups are cyclic (e.g.\\ order $3$), the differential becomes an isomorphism and forces a $K$-theoretic obstruction to Morita triviality. This yields a conceptual mechanism for producing non-Morita-trivial twisted C$^*$-algebras with quantum-group crossed-product fibers, detected purely by Mayer--Vietoris/\u010cech data.",

We will develop a new approach, being more straightforward and elementary than the measure-theoretic one provided by Ohno, to the theory for weak equivalence of flows, and as a novelty, we study both topological entropy and mean dimension with a highly unified process in relation to such objects.\n  In particular, for weakly equivalent flows without fixed points we recover Ohno's theorem for topological entropy relation with a substantially different method, and moreover, carry out an analogue within the framework of mean dimension; while for weakly equivalent flows with fixed points, our technique refines the procedure suggested in Ohno's construction, and strengthens Ohno's example with a view towards topological complexity of dynamical systems.\n  Essentially, our method is topological. For this purpose, we first introduce a modification to the definition of topological entropy, by relating a spanning set inside the state space to a finite set outside, which comes to be a tiny but key difference, via a map, and further, show that it leads eventually to the same value as the topological entropy. Although to an intermediate extent, the modified quantity generally does not coincide with the one appearing in the classical definition, it has some basic combinatorial feature, which not only applies flexibly to topological entropy, but also adapts directly to the mean dimension context. Using this alternative, we are allowed to re-establish and enrich Ohno's theory.",

Within this description, Shannon information plays the role of entropy, and an integrating factor organizes its variation into a first-law-type balance equation. The framework supports a cyclic inequality analogous to a reversed second law, derived for the estimation of the mean. A non-trivial third-law-type result emerges as a lower bound on entropy set by representation noise. Optimal inference paths, global bounds on information gain, and a natural Carnot-like information efficiency follow from this structure, with efficiency fundamentally limited by a noise floor. Finally, de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation in the Gaussian-limit case appear as coordinate projections of the same underlying thermodynamic structure. This framework suggests that ensemble physics and inferential physics constitute shadow processes evolving in opposite directions within a unified thermodynamic description.",

We prove the existence of a pathwise mean-field equilibrium in this context by developing new technical tools for compactification to accommodate rough integration, which deviate substantially from classical compactification arguments in the literature. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the pathwise problem and the classical MFG problem with randomized Brownian common noise: conditioning yields the pathwise problem almost surely; and conversely, under a suitable causality/measurable-selection requirement, pathwise mean-field equilibria can be aggregated to produce randomized mean-field equilibria in the classical problem.",

In this paper we propose a directional first order approach which does not require the convexity of the lower level program. First, under some reasonable assumptions, we show that the lower level program can be equivalently characterized by its first order condition over a directional neighborhood. Next, for the resulting single level optimization problem, under common constraint qualifications, we establish directional necessary optimality conditions.

We show that any reconstruction-consistent autoencoder atlas canonically defines transition maps satisfying the cocycle condition, and that linearising these transition maps yields a vector bundle coinciding with the tangent bundle when the latent dimension matches the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. This construction provides direct access to differential-topological invariants of the data. In particular, we show that the first Stiefel-Whitney class can be computed from the signs of the Jacobians of learned transition maps, yielding an algorithmic criterion for detecting orientability. We also show that non-trivial characteristic classes provide obstructions to single-chart representations, and that the minimum number of autoencoder charts is determined by the good cover structure of the manifold. Finally, we apply our methodology to low-dimensional orientable and non-orientable manifolds, as well as to a non-orientable high-dimensional image dataset.",

    "abstract": "In vibro-impact mechanics, the division between an impact and a near miss is a zero-velocity grazing event. Grazing bifurcations of stable periodic motions often produce complicated attractors when grazing generates a square-root term in the Poincar\u00e9 map. This paper concerns codimension-two scenarios for which the square-root term vanishes in some iterate of the Poincar\u00e9 map. For forced one-degree-of-freedom oscillators, this occurs when the forcing frequency is a certain rational multiple of the damped natural frequency, i.e., the system is in resonance. In two-parameter bifurcation diagrams, curves of saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations of single-impact periodic motions emanate from the codimension-two points. In this paper we prove these curves are quadratically tangent to the curve of grazing bifurcations, and derive explicit formulas for their quadratic coefficients. This is achieved by modifying the Poincar\u00e9 map in a way that circumvents the square-root singularity, enabling us to use the implicit function theorem to demonstrate smoothness and perform asymptotic calculations of the saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcation curves. In doing so we resolve a long-standing conjecture on the admissibility of single-impact periodic motions by supplementing raw asymptotic computations with geometric and topological arguments. We illustrate the results with a linear impact oscillator model, matching the theoretical unfolding to numerically computed bifurcation curves. The results explain why previously reported physical experiments reveal an absence of chaos shortly past the grazing bifurcation.",

Many different filtrations exist, each with its own assumptions and trade-offs, but all face some form of this growth which can be exponential in the worst case, as for the Vietoris-Rips. We recast this problem at the level of covers, developing a framework in which filtrations and persistence modules can be constructed, analyzed, and compared through simple relations between covers rather than at the level of simplicial complexes. The guarantees propagate through any functor that preserves the contiguity of refinement maps, we give the example of two such functors: the Nerve and the Co-Nerve. Working at this level is drastically simpler, with stronger, more general consequences. We explore this perspective and show how it can be used to construct a robust approximation of the Vietoris-Rips filtration that is orders of magnitude smaller, while maintaining a log 3-interleaving unconditionally for any metric space. The resulting filtration restores near-linear scaling in the number of data points and enable us to efficiently capture homology at high degrees.",

This is the sharpest consequence of the \"Averaging plus Learning\" framework studied here, where agents update opinions by socially averaging neighbours while some receive private feedback at heterogeneous rates. The key is a graph-theoretic property we call condensely anchored, which implies convergence to the correct consensus on fixed networks. In the original framework of Popescu and Vaidya (2023), every agent was required to learn. Removing that requirement changes the problem fundamentally: the underlying graph must now carry the signal from a handful of anchors to everyone else. When learning rates decay to zero, a persistence condition on the rates alone suffices, with no uniform connectivity or aperiodicity assumed. The hardest case is intermittent connectivity, where no single time step contracts in any standard norm. A mixed-operator-norm framework is developed that extracts two-step contraction from the interplay between aggregate learning mass and entrywise diffusion of influence, a mechanism new to consensus literature. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's robustness: vanishing noise preserves convergence to the ground truth, whereas persistent noise drives the system to a limiting law.",

    "abstract": "We investigate whether it is typical for a sparse graph to be uniquely characterized by its adjacency spectrum up to isomorphism. Our first result shows that the giant component of an Erd\u0151s-R\u00e9nyi graph is cospectral when the average degree is sufficiently small. The proof relies on the existence of a specific pendant tree, combined with a method by Schwenk that swaps trees to construct a cospectral mate.\n  It seems possible that pendant trees are essentially the only obstruction, meaning that the giant should become characterized by spectrum with high probability if one prunes these by considering the 2-core. The majority of the paper is devoted to theoretical and numerical evidence supporting this concept. Our main theorem in this direction establishes that local switching methods can not cause the 2-core to be cospectral. We also discuss R-cospectrality and rational cospectrality at fixed level.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a distributed nonconvex optimization problem over multi-agent networks, where each agent exchanges its local information solely with its neighbors. Given that most existing distributed nonconvex optimization algorithms are susceptible to information leakage during inter agent communications, we propose a Robust Proximal Primal dual algorithm, referred to as RPP, to enhance the security of information transmission. In contrast to many existing approaches that directly transmit local variables throughout the network, we introduce carefully designed random noises to obfuscate sensitive local information. This not only preserves privacy but also demonstrates the noise robustness of our proposed algorithm. We establish a sublinear rate at which RPP converges to a stationary solution. Moreover, by incorporating Chebyshev acceleration, an accelerated variant of RPP is developed and achieves the optimal communication complexity bound for the algorithms that allow for exchanging local deci sions at each iteration. The superior convergence performance of RPP is validated through a few numerical experiments, which also indicate that, within an appropriate range, the introduced perturbations do not impede the convergence speed of RPP.",

These coordinates are referred to as the non-regular part of the model. We show that in a ``pre-asymptotic'' regime in which the limiting Laplace approximation is not yet valid, the low-temperature Gibbs distribution concentrates on a neighborhood of its mode. Within this region, the distribution is a bounded perturbation of a product measure: a strongly log-concave distribution in the regular part and a one-dimensional exponential-type distribution in each coordinate of the non-regular part. Leveraging this structure, we provide a non-asymptotic sampling guarantee by analyzing the spectral gap of Langevin dynamics. Key examples of low-temperature Gibbs distributions include Bayesian posteriors, and we demonstrate our results on three canonical examples: a high-dimensional logistic regression model, a Poisson linear model, and a Gaussian mixture model.",

The resulting method avoids coil meshing, supports arbitrary winding paths, and enables high-order field approximation within a reduced computational domain.

Moreover, we extend these blow-up results to the setting where $g'(u)$ is polynomially controlled, which includes typical nonlinearities such as $ g(u)=\u03bau+3u^2 $ for the classical CH-KP equations.

The choice-based linear programming (CBLP) formulation provides a powerful framework for optimizing sales allocations across customer segments, yet traditional approaches often fail to solve CBLPs of huge scale (involving millions of customer choices) due to the lack of algorithmic designs that exploit problem structure. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose a first-order primal-dual method, SPFOM, which requires only a small computational cost per iteration, achieves a provably near-optimal convergence rate, and can be readily extended to parallel computing environments. Computational experiments demonstrate the computational and practical superiority of SPFOM over state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale linear programs. The framework is extended to a multi-period assortment optimization setting with inventory constraints, where SPFOM estimates global shadow prices that enhance classical bid-price control policies compared with benchmark methods such as market segment decomposition. Numerical experiments and a case study using real-world data from the ZOZOTOWN platform validate the practical effectiveness of SPFOM, highlighting its advantages in improving revenue performance while maintaining balanced inventory levels.",

The Ramanujan condition corresponds to the optimal rate of decay of correlations for the associated non-backtracking edge subshift. We consider a higher-dimensional generalization of this observation. We introduce the notion of a $d$-regular $\\mathbb{Z}^\u03b4$-subshift of finite type, and we define a Ramanujan subshift as a $d$-regular $\\mathbb{Z}^\u03b4$-subshift with an optimal rate of decay of correlations. We show that for every odd prime power $q\\geq 3$ and dimension $\u03b4<q$, there exists a $q$-regular Ramanujan $\\mathbb{Z}^\u03b4$-subshift. The construction is based on the quaternionic lattices over $\\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ introduced by Rungtanapirom-Stix-Vdovina (2019). Each of our $q$-regular Ramanujan subshifts gives rise to a family of non-bipartite $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs. These graphs are very explicit and local in the strong sense: the neighbors of any vertex can be computed by an explicit Mealy automaton associated with the subshift. As a byproduct, for every odd prime power $q$, we get a single lifting rule that can be iterated to produce an infinite family of $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs.",

Using the Brito--Chacon--Naveira calibration $\u03c9=a\\wedge\u0398$ on the unit tangent bundle $E=UTS^{n}$, we establish the universal calibrated lower bound $\\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)\\ge c(m;1)\\,\\mathrm{vol}(S^{n})$, where $c(m;1)=4^{m}/\\binom{2m}{m}$. In the relaxed (integral-current) setting, we show that the section-constrained stable mass in $E$ equals the calibration value and is attained by an $\u03c9$-calibrated mass-minimizing integral $n$-cycle in the section class.\n  We also analyze the equality case on smooth graphs. If a smooth graph is $\u03c9$-calibrated on an open set, then it satisfies the rigidity system $\\nabla_V V=0$ and $\\nabla_X V=\u03bbX$ for all $X\\perp V$, hence is locally a radial distance-gradient field. In particular, for $m\\ge 2$ there is no smooth unit field on $S^n$ whose graph is $\u03c9$-calibrated everywhere.\n  Finally, we construct an explicit smooth recovery sequence (presented in detail for $S^5$ and then extended to all odd dimensions) and prove a uniform nonvanishing estimate for the polar-shell normalization in the patching construction. As a consequence, $\\inf_{V}\\,\\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)=c(m;1)\\,\\mathrm{vol}(S^{n})$, so there is no Lavrentiev gap.",

    "abstract": "We present a method to find asymptotics for the evolution of coherent states (or Gaussian wavepackets with standard deviation $\\sqrt{h}$) under semiclassical Schr\u00f6dinger's equation for a given Hamiltonian. These results extend the work of Combescure and Robert, in which the evolution of coherent states can be approximated in the limit $h\\to 0$ with deformed Gaussian wavepackets called squeezed coherent states. The description with squeezed states holds for times $t$ that can go to infinity as $h\\to 0$, under the constraint $|t|\\leq |\\log h|/(6\u03bb_0)$ where $\u03bb_0$ is the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics. The breakdown of this approximation at time $|\\log h|/(6\u03bb_0)$ is related to the bending of evolved wavepackets: once propagated states spread at a scale $h^{1/3}$, squeezed states no longer provide an appropriate description. To obtain a representation of propagated states valid up to times $|t|\\leq C|\\log h|$ with a larger $C$ (for instance, up to Ehrenfest's time $|\\log h|/(2\u03bb_0)$ where spreading on macroscopic scales is allowed), we make additional assumptions on the flow $\u03a6_t$ associated to the classical dynamics, imposing constraints on directions of elongation. Namely, we work in a neighborhood of a normally hyperbolic $\u03a6_t$-invariant submanifold $K$, on which the dynamics is considered as slow in comparison with its transverse directions, along which $\u03a6_t$ is assumed to be hyperbolic. In this context, we describe the propagated state as a WKB state in transverse directions and a squeezed state along $K$. This description emphasizes the fact that propagated states should no longer be thought of as microlocalized on a point, but rather on an isotropic submanifold (corresponding to transverse unstable directions). Guillemin, Uribe, and Wang presented a similar class of wavefunctions microlocalized on an isotropic submanifold.",

Moreover, we prove that these pointwise decay estimates are sharp for a generic class of small initial data decaying sufficiently fast.\n  As applications of these estimates, we demonstrate that the energy of one component of the solution admits a lower bound that generically grows to infinity as $t\\to +\\infty$, which can be interpreted as ``blowing up at infinity.\" Furthermore, we verify that this component generically exhibits an energy cascade from high to low frequencies.",

We outline how this result particularises to the circumstances of the seminal work of Combettes and Pesquet on stochastic quasi-Fej\u00e9r monotone sequences in separable Hilbert spaces, and we provide an initial application by illustrating how these results can be used to provide a metastable rate of pointwise convergence for a stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann scheme solving a stochastic common fixed point problem for nonexpansive maps over proper Hadamard spaces.

While gradient dominance has been extensively studied, continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs have largely been analyzed separately, relying on slightly different assumptions, proof strategies, and resulting guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified gradient dominance property for both continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs under mild stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Our analysis is based on a convex reformulation derived from a common Lyapunov inequality representation and a unified change-of-variables procedure. This convex-lifting perspective yields a single proof framework applicable to both time models. The unified treatment clarifies how differences between continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics influence theoretical guarantees and reveals a deeper structural symmetry between the two formulations.

Here, we review Legendre's conjecture on primes between consecutive squares and recent progress on the weaker question of primes between consecutive larger powers. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis (RH), we observe that a recent result of Emanuel Carneiro, Micah Milinovich and Kannan Soundararajan, combined with a large-scale computation by Jonathan Sorenson and Jonathan Webster, implies the existence of primes between $x^{2+\u03b4}$ and $(x+1)^{2+\u03b4}$ for all real $x \\geq 1$ when $\u03b4\\geq 1/4$. For smaller values of $\u03b4> 0$, we provide an explicit bound $x_0 = x_0 (\u03b4)$ such that primes exist in these intervals whenever $x \\geq x_0$ (again assuming RH).

The computation rate of All-Reduce is defined as the number of sum instances that can be computed over each network use. For the computation rate, we provide a cut-set upper bound and a linear programming lower bound based on time (bandwidth) sharing over all schemes that first perform Reduce (aggregating all inputs at one node) and then perform Broadcast (sending the sum from that node to all other nodes). Specializing the two general bounds gives us the optimal computation rate for a class of communication networks and the best-known rate bounds (where the upper bound is no more than twice of the lower bound) for cyclic, complete, and hypercube networks.",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers a versatile framework for constraint handling and multi-objective optimisation, yet practical application faces challenges regarding initial and recursive feasibility, robustness against model mismatches, and sampled-data constraints. This thesis develops a novel MPC framework for a class of non-linear continuous-time systems governed by functional differential equations. It targets output tracking within prescribed error bounds while systematically overcoming these challenges.\n  First, we introduce funnel MPC, an algorithm eliminating reliance on terminal conditions or restrictive long prediction horizons. Utilising funnel penalty functions -- state costs penalising tracking error deviations from time-varying boundaries -- this framework ensures feasibility while rigorously enforcing tracking performance guarantees.\n  Next, we unify funnel MPC with model-free funnel feedback into a hybrid architecture. This synergises model-based optimisation with adaptive feedback compensation, achieving prescribed tracking performance despite structural model-plant mismatches, unmodelled dynamics, and unknown disturbances.\n  To further enhance predictive accuracy, we integrate a data-driven learning framework that iteratively refines the model using system measurements, improving long-term performance without compromising robustness.\n  Finally, we formalise the transition to sampled-data implementations. We derive explicit bounds on sampling rates and control effort to guarantee stability under piecewise constant control signals, a critical step for digital hardware deployment.\n  By addressing feasibility, robustness, learning, and sampling, this thesis establishes a cohesive framework for output tracking within prescribed bounds, paving the way for future advances in learning-enhanced and robust MPC.",

One might expect bounded theories to have only bounded types. In fact, an analogue holds in infinitary logic, where the complexity of a Scott sentence roughly agrees with the complexity of the most complicated automorphism orbit.

In such systems, the FES corresponds to basic data processing or packet routing, while SOS represents secondary tasks such as encryption, error checking, data compression, or deep packet inspection that may not be necessary for every packet. Here, we derive the bivariate probability generating functions for the joint distribution of the number of packets waiting for transmission and the number are being processed immediately after the completion of both the FES and SOS. Furthermore, the complete joint distribution at arbitrary time slots, including vacation completion states, is established. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, including an example with discrete phase type service time distribution. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the key parameters on marginal system's probabilities and different performance measures have been investigated through several graphical representations.",

We prove this bound for both the unrooted and rooted version of the problem, and demonstrate that the bound r, the length to which common chains are truncated, is tight.

To model this system, we introduce a virtual state-dependent channel, where the state-representing context-plays a crucial role in shaping communication.

Arc-Flow reformulations are a lesser known technique related to dynamic programming that has experienced a resurgence as result of the recent popularization of decision diagrams as a tool for solving integer programs. Although these two reformulation techniques arose independently, the recently proposed solution paradigm known as column elimination has revealed that they are in fact closely connected. Building on a unified formulation and notation, this study clarifies the theoretical connections and computational trade-offs between these two reformulations.\n  We first revisit the known fact that the LP relaxations of these two reformulations yield the same dual bound. We then dig deeper, establishing conditions under which valid inequalities in the original, Dantzig-Wolfe, or Arc-Flow spaces can be translated across reformulations without loss of strength, and reinterpreting iterative strengthening methods, such as decremental state-space relaxation and column elimination, through the lens of cutting planes. To assess the potential impact of these insights empirically, we benchmark both reformulations under identical conditions on the vehicle routing problem with time windows using state-of-the-art column- and cut-generation techniques. The results identify clear contrasts: the Arc-Flow reformulation benefits from faster convergence and performs best when subproblems are highly relaxed or low-dimensional, whereas the Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is more efficient when the master problem remains compact. Overall, our study provides a unified perspective and practical guidelines for choosing between Dantzig-Wolfe and Arc-Flow reformulations in large-scale integer optimization.",

Our approach involves an enrichment of P\u00f3lya's cycle index polynomial of a graph to a certain algebra $\u039b^{[2]}$ of wreath product symmetric functions. Building on foundational work of Macdonald, we prove that $\u039b^{[2]}$ may be viewed as the Grothendieck ring of the category of polynomial functors which map symmetric sequences of vector spaces to vector spaces. This interpretation gives rise to an action of $\u039b^{[2]}$ on the ordinary ring of symmetric functions $\u039b$, which is described concretely in terms of Adams operations and skewing by power sums. This action lets us deduce appealing formulas, involving only ordinary symmetric functions, for generating functions of $S_n$-equivariant Euler characteristics.",

By analyzing the second variation of a conformally invariant Willmore-type functional, we derive the lower bound $\u039b_1 \\geq 2\\,\\mathfrak{Ric}$, where $\\mathfrak{Ric}$ denotes the infimum of the ambient Ricci curvature. For K\u00e4hler-Einstein surfaces with positive Einstein constant $\\mathfrak{c}>0$, this bound reduces to $\u039b_1 \\geq 2\\mathfrak{c}$. We then explore the equality case, computing the exact dimension of the corresponding first eigenspace in terms of the area, genus, and the dimension of a space of holomorphic sections. This analysis shows that the equality is achieved for all curves of genus $g \\leq 1$.",

We first propose an exact sequential lifting algorithm for the binary knapsack set, which employs the dominance list structure to remove redundant storage and computation in the dynamic programming (DP) array. This structure preserves scale invariance and effectively handles constraints with non-integer coefficients. Then, a reduction method is developed for the lifting procedure under some conditions, further enhancing computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms DP with arrays in terms of both efficiency and stability, particularly for large-scale and large-capacity instances. Moreover, it enables exact sequential lifting for binary knapsack sets with non-integer weights and large capacities, making it directly applicable in modern MIP solvers.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is often driven by specific combinations of an estimated two to nine gene mutations, known as multi-hit combinations. Identifying these combinations is critical for understanding carcinogenesis and designing targeted therapies. We formalise this challenge as the Multi-Hit Cancer Driver Set Cover Problem (MHCDSCP), a binary classification problem that selects gene combinations to maximise coverage of tumor samples while minimising coverage of normal samples. Existing approaches typically rely on exhaustive search and supercomputing infrastructure. In this paper, we present constraint programming and mixed integer programming formulations of the MHCDSCP. Evaluated on real-world cancer genomics data, our methods achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while running on a single commodity CPU in under a minute. Furthermore, we introduce a column generation heuristic capable of solving small instances to optimality. These results suggest that solving the MHCDSCP is less computationally intensive than previously believed, thereby opening research directions for exploring modelling assumptions.",

Moreover, we show that varying the exact structure on $\\mathcal{A}$ induces Bousfield (co)localisation sequences between the corresponding homotopy categories. We use these techniques to study the category ${}_{Q,A}\\operatorname{Mod}$ of ${}_{A}\\operatorname{Mod}$-valued representations, for a ring $A$, of a suitable $\\Bbbk$-linear small category $Q$, where we apply our results to a range of objectwise exact structures, ranging from the split exact structure to the abelian one. In particular, we recover the $Q$-shaped derived category of Holm and Jorgensen and construct an intermediate $Q$-shaped homotopy category, analogous to the homotopy category of complexes. Finally, we show that the $Q$-shaped derived category is a Verdier quotient of the $Q$-shaped homotopy category, and that this quotient functor is part of recollement - generalising results of Verdier, Krause, and Iyama-Kato-Miyachi for complexes and $N$-complexes, respectively.",

The method tokenizes text with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), reorders the vocabulary so that frequent tokens receive small integer identifiers, and encodes the result with variable-length integers before passing it to any standard compressor. On enwik8 (100 MB Wikipedia), this yields improvements of 7.08 percentage points (pp) for zlib, 1.69 pp for LZMA, and 0.76 pp for zstd (all including vocabulary overhead), outperforming the classical Word Replacing Transform. Gains are consistent at 1 GB scale (enwik9) and across Chinese and Arabic text. We further show that preprocessing accelerates compression for computationally expensive algorithms: the total wall-clock time including preprocessing is 3.1x faster than raw zstd-22 and 2.4x faster than raw LZMA, because the preprocessed input is substantially smaller. The method can be implemented in under 50 lines of code.",

    "abstract": "Coalescing particles on a line merge when they meet. When every site is initially occupied, only finitely many particles survive at any positive time, and their positions form a Pfaffian point process: all correlation functions are determined by pairwise quantities arranged in antisymmetric matrices. Previous proofs of this structure relied on analytic methods specific to time-homogeneous dynamics. We identify the checkerboard duality as the structural reason for the Pfaffian: on a discrete planar graph, binary random choices create two complementary non-crossing forests, one tracing ancestral lineages backward and the other carrying the coalescing particles forward as domain boundaries. This duality converts the absence of particles in an interval into coalescence of ancestral lineages at its endpoints. A cancellative labeling then converts coalescence into annihilation, for which a companion paper provides a Pfaffian formula. The resulting empty-interval formula holds for any discrete graph with the checkerboard structure and arbitrary inhomogeneous edge probabilities, requiring no symmetry or specific distributions. This covers settings beyond existing methods, including totally asymmetric dynamics and position-dependent transition rules, and yields an explicit Pfaffian point process in each setting. For Brownian motion, the formula recovers the known Pfaffian point process and the empty-interval probabilities previously derived by PDE methods.",

Our approach utilizes multi-modal data to construct virtual base stations (VBSs), which are geometrically defined as mirror images of the base station across reflecting surfaces reconstructed from 3D LiDAR points. These VBSs provide a sparse and spatial representation of the dominant features of the wireless environment. Based on the constructed VBSs, we develop a VBS-assisted beam alignment scheme comprising coarse channel reconstruction followed by partial beam training.

A key innovation lies in a new straight-line program (SLP) representation that enables compact representation and efficient computation of hyperbolic polynomials, their gradients, and Hessians. The SLP structure significantly reduces computational cost, allowing the Hessian to be computed in the same asymptotic complexity as the gradient through a batched reverse-over-forward differentiation scheme. We further introduce an improved corrector step for the primal-dual interior-point method, enhancing stability and convergence on convex sets where only the primal self-concordant barrier is efficiently computable. We create a comprehensive benchmark library beyond the elementary symmetric polynomials, using several different techniques.

Until now, rigorous bounds for Laplace expansions in growing dimension have been restricted to the \"Gaussian-approximation\" regime, known to hold when $d^2/\u03bb\\to0$. This excludes many practically relevant regimes, including those arising in physics and modern high-dimensional statistics, which operate beyond this threshold while still satisfying the concentration condition $d/\u03bb\\to0$. Here, we close this gap. We develop an explicit asymptotic expansion for $\\log I(\u03bb)$ with quantitative remainder bounds that remain valid throughout this intermediate region, arbitrarily close to the concentration threshold $d/\u03bb\\to0$.\n  Fix any $L\\ge1$ and suppose $g(0)=1$. Assume that, in a neighborhood of the minimizer of $f$, the operator norms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are bounded independently of $d$ and $\u03bb$ through orders $2(L+1)$ and $2L$, respectively. Assuming also some mild global growth conditions on $f$ and $g$, we prove that $$ \\log I(\u03bb)=\\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} b_k(f,g)\u03bb^{-k}+O(d^{L+1}/\u03bb^L),\\quad d^{L+1}/\u03bb^L\\to0, $$ and that the coefficients satisfy $b_k(f,g)= O(d^{k+1})$. Moreover, the coefficients $b_k(f,g)$ coincide with those arising from the formal cumulant-based expansion of $\\log I(\u03bb)$.\n  The proof is constructive and proceeds via explicit polynomial changes of variables that iteratively \"quadratize\" the exponent while controlling Jacobian effects, thereby avoiding heavy Gaussian concentration machinery.

In this work, we go beyond the semi-Markov framework by considering some non-Markovian chains, which exhibit long-memory behaviour, due to stochastic dependence among their waiting times. Particular attention is devoted to the so-called para-Markov chains. Their waiting times share the same marginal distributions as those of the above mentioned semi-Markov chains, but they are dependent; their joint distribution is of Schur-constant type and is closely related to complete Bernstein functions and De Finetti's theorems. A second model that we focus on is given by time-changed Markov chains, where the random time is the inverse of an increasing stable process. This generalizes well-known semi-Markov models available in the literature, which typically focus solely on the inverse of the Levy stable subordinator. The above mentioned models are unified by a general theory of time change of Markov chains.",

The volume fractions remain nontrivial and are transported by the limit flow. Our method is based on the introduction of suitable modulated quantities and a novel relative entropy functional adapted to the two-phase structure. The key novelty lies in an original comparison of L1 and L2 norms of the partial densities, exploiting the special structure of the bi-fluid system, together with a variant of Csiszar-Kullback- Pinsker inequality.

    "abstract": "This paper addresses boundary prescribed-time stabilization of a one-dimensional heat equation with spatially and temporally varying coefficients. In contrast to asymptotic or exponential stabilization, prescribed-time stabilization ensures convergence to equilibrium within a user-defined time that is independent of the initial condition, a property that is particularly attractive in applications with stringent transient performance requirements. The backstepping design for this problem requires solving, at each time instant, a two-dimensional time-dependent kernel Partial Differential Equation (PDE) whose solution continuously varies with the plant coefficients. The repeated numerical solution of this parabolic kernel PDE results in a prohibitive computational burden, thereby limiting real-time applicability. To overcome this limitation, we propose a neural-operator-based approximation of the mapping from the time-varying system coefficient to the corresponding backstepping kernel. The operator is trained offline using representative solutions of the kernel PDE and subsequently deployed online to generate the required time-varying kernels in real time. We establish, via Lyapunov analysis, that the resulting neural-operator-based controller preserves prescribed-time stability provided that the operator approximation error satisfies an explicit bound. Furthermore, we investigate a direct approximation of the full feedback law mapping the plant parameter functions and state measurements to the boundary control input. For this setting, we prove semiglobal practical prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the computational cost of kernel generation by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling real-time prescribed-time stabilization for heat equations with spatially and temporally varying coefficients.",

    "abstract": "Let $\\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ be the $(k-1)$-dimensional projective space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. An arc in $\\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ is a set of points with the property that any $k$ of them span the entire space. The notion of pseudo-arc generalizes that of an arc by replacing points with higher-dimensional subspaces. Constructions of pseudo-arcs can be obtained from arcs defined over extension fields; such pseudo-arcs are necessarily Desarguesian, in the sense that all their elements belong to a Desarguesian spread. In contrast, genuinely non-Desarguesian pseudo-arcs are far less understood and have previously been known only in a few sporadic cases. In this paper, we introduce a new infinite family of non-Desarguesian pseudo-arcs consisting of $(h-1)$-dimensional subspaces of $\\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ based on the imaginary spaces of a normal rational curve. We determine the size of the constructed pseudo-arcs explicitly and show that, by adding suitable osculating spaces of a normal rational curve defined over a subgeometry, we obtain pseudo-arcs of size $O(q^h)$. As $q$ grows, these sizes asymptotically attain the classical upper bound for pseudo-arcs established in 1971 by J.~A.~Thas, thereby showing that this bound is essentially sharp also in the non-Desarguesian setting. We further investigate the interaction between these new pseudo-arcs and quadrics. While Desarguesian pseudo-arcs from normal rational curve are complete intersections of quadrics, we prove that the new pseudo-arcs are not contained in any quadric of the ambient projective space. Finally, we translate our geometric results into coding theory. We show that the new pseudo-arcs correspond precisely to recent families of additive MDS codes introduced via a polynomial framework. As a consequence of their non-Desarguesian nature, we prove that these codes are not equivalent to linear MDS codes.",

    "abstract": "Risk-averse decision-making under uncertainty in partially observable domains is a central challenge in artificial intelligence and is essential for developing reliable autonomous agents. The formal framework for such problems is the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where risk sensitivity is introduced through a risk measure applied to the value function, with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) being a particularly significant criterion. However, solving POMDPs is computationally intractable in general, and approximate methods rely on computationally expensive simulations of future agent trajectories. This work introduces a theoretical framework for accelerating CVaR value function evaluation in POMDPs with formal performance guarantees. We derive new bounds on the CVaR of a random variable X using an auxiliary random variable Y, under assumptions relating their cumulative distribution and density functions; these bounds yield interpretable concentration inequalities and converge as the distributional discrepancy vanishes. Building on this, we establish upper and lower bounds on the CVaR value function computable from a simplified belief-MDP, accommodating general simplifications of the transition dynamics. We develop estimators for these bounds within a particle-belief MDP framework with probabilistic guarantees, and employ them for acceleration via action elimination: actions whose bounds indicate suboptimality under the simplified model are safely discarded while ensuring consistency with the original POMDP. Empirical evaluation across multiple POMDP domains confirms that the bounds reliably separate safe from dangerous policies while achieving substantial computational speedups under the simplified model.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the optimal control of large-scale autonomous systems under explicitly adversarial conditions, incorporating the probabilistic destruction of agents over time. In many such systems, adversarial interactions arise as different agents or groups compete against one another. A crucial yet often overlooked factor in existing theoretical and modeling frameworks is the random attrition of agents during operation. Effective modeling and control strategies must therefore account for both agent attrition and spatial dynamics.\n  Given the inherently random nature of agent survival, directly solving this problem is challenging. To address this, we propose and evaluate three approximate numerical modeling approaches in which agent survival probabilities decrease deterministically over time based on their relative positions. We apply these schemes to a scenario where agents defend a high-value unit against an attacking swarm. Our results demonstrate that these models can effectively capture the dynamics of such interactions, provided that attrition and spatial positioning are tightly integrated. These findings are relevant to a broad range of adversarial autonomy scenarios where both agent positioning and survival probabilities play a critical role.",

We jointly optimize antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming to maximize the multiuser sum secrecy rate, which complicates the solution process. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we use a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm, which incorporates the proximal distance algorithm (PDA) for closed-form beamformer updates and extrapolated projected gradient (EPG) for APV optimization.

    "abstract": "We study free orthotropic material optimization for two-dimensional plane-stress compliance minimization with two well-ordered isotropic phases, motivated by the gap between tensors admissible in classical free-material optimization and tensors realizable by composites. To reduce this gap, we construct a hierarchy of realizability-aware admissible sets induced by zeroth-order, Voigt, and Hashin--Shtrikman (HS) energy bounds, moving from convex relaxations to a tighter nonconvex model. In the convex zeroth-order and Voigt settings, the Voigt set is strictly tighter for intermediate volume fractions and coincides with the zeroth-order set at pure-phase endpoints, and the Voigt model reduces to an isotropic variable-thickness-sheet formulation. In the single-loadcase continuum zeroth-order problem, at least one optimal solution can be chosen orthotropic. For HS constraints, we rewrite the bound as a Voigt term minus a nonnegative correction, clarifying strict tightening for interior volume fractions and local nonconvexity. We further prove that the convex hull of the HS feasible set equals the Voigt set and derive reduced formulations via active-constraint analysis and explicit elementwise volume characterization, including reductions specialized to orthotropic effective tensors. In the single-loadcase continuum setting, the HS relaxation is tight with the Allaire--Kohn relaxed problem, attained in the relaxation sense by sequential laminates, whereas in generic multi-loadcase settings it provides a lower bound on optimal compliance over general microstructures. The resulting nonconvex orthotropic HS problem is solved by sequential global programming, and numerical results confirm the predicted compliance hierarchy and show close agreement with finite-rank laminate references.",

    "abstract": "Persistent homology is a popular method for computing topological features of (metric) data. Standard approaches based on the \u010cech or Rips filtration are stable under small perturbations of the data, but highly sensitive to outliers. This lack of robustness has been frequently addressed in the literature. In this paper, we take a novel perspective by asking the following question: When can we guarantee that an observed persistent feature (a bar) is inherent to the underlying data in the presence of a limited number of unknown, arbitrary outliers. We formalize this question by introducing the notion of \\emph{adversarial robustness}, and study the problem of deciding whether a given bar in the barcode of a filtered simplicial complex is adversarially robust. We show that this problem is essentially equivalent to a homological variant of the minimum cut problem in simplicial complexes, which we believe to be of independent interest. As our main technical contribution, we provide the first computational complexity results for this problem, consisting of an efficient algorithm in $0$-dimensional homology, NP-hardness for the general problem, and an efficient algorithm for codimension-$1$ in $n$-dimensional complexes embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We also analyze its natural linear programming relaxation, whose dual defines a homological analog of the max-flow problem in graphs. We show that a max-flow/min-cut theorem does not hold in our setting, implying that the LP relaxation is not tight in general. Finally, in the special case of the Rips filtration, we provide a global heuristic based on the Hausdorff distance that guarantees adversarial robustness of sufficiently long bars. This connects adversarial robustness to standard stability theorems in persistent homology.",

Measurements further indicate that the exponential growth rate in the long-wave regime agrees quantitatively with the classical predictions of Rayleigh and Plateau. This phenomenon is known as the \\emph{Rayleigh-Plateau instability}. In this paper, we provide a mathematical justification of these experimental observations. The motion of the water jet is modeled by an irrotational Eulerian free-boundary system governed by surface tension. We prove that the (un)stable directions in the linearized system, corresponding to long-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to an (un)stable invariant manifold of the full nonlinear system. On the other hand, the elliptic directions, corresponding to short-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to a center invariant set in a generalized sense. These results give a positive answer to the question raised by Lin-Zeng concerning the existence of invariant manifolds for Eulerian free-boundary systems. The major methodological contribution is the construction of ``paradifferential propagator\" corresponding to linear paradifferential hyperbolic systems along elliptic directions, making Lyapunov-Perron type arguments applicable. The method effectively balances the loss of regularity in quasilinear problems and can be generalized to a broader class of PDEs.",

We prove that superexponential spectral localization persists for arbitrary N and every interaction strength.",

    "title": "Combinatorial Properties of the Raisonnier Filter",
    "abstract": "The Raisonnier Filter is a combinatorial object isolated by Jean Raisonnier in order to simplify Shelah's proof that if all $\\boldsymbol\u03a3^1_3$ sets are Lebesgue-measurable then there is an inner model with an inaccessible cardinal. In this paper, we study the combinatorics of a general version of the Raisonnier filter, with an eye to potential applications in descriptive set theory. Among the most interesting of our results is a partial converse to Raisonnier's theorem, which can be used to provide a new characterisation of the statement \"all $\\boldsymbol\u03a3^1_2$ sets are measurable\". We also introduce an ideal on the Cantor Space induced by the Raisonnier filter and study its cardinal characteristics, connecting them to the well-known characteristics in Cicho\u0144's Diagram.",

    "abstract": "In areas as diverse as contemporary art, play structures, climbing equipment, and modular construction toys, we see the presence of building block-like polyhedral complexes, which are generalizations of the pieces in the game Tetris. We give an algorithm for counting the number of $n$-celled structures on polygonal and polyhedral cells of certain periodic two- and three-dimensional tilings; moreover, we count these structures up to translations, rotations, and reflections of the tiling. We describe this algorithm with respect to structures in the snub square tiling, provide numerical data related to existing three-dimensional art and structures, and suggest puzzles based on these constructions.",

    "title": "Largest Sidon subsets in weak Sidon sets",
    "abstract": "A finite set $ S \\subset \\mathbb{R} $ is called a Sidon set if all sums $ x+y $ with $ x,y \\in S $ and $ x \\le y $ are distinct, and a weak Sidon set if all sums $ x+y $ with $ x,y \\in S $ and $ x < y $ are distinct. For a finite set $ A \\subset \\mathbb{R} $, let $ h(A) $ denote the maximum size of a Sidon subset of $ A $, and define $$ g(n) := \\min\\{\\, h(A) : A \\subset \\mathbb{R},\\ |A| = n,\\ A \\text{ is a weak Sidon set} \\,\\}. $$ S\u00e1rk\u00f6zy and S\u00f3s asked whether the limit $ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} g(n)/n $ exists and, if so, to determine its value. We resolve this problem completely by proving that $$ \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{g(n)}{n} = \\frac{1}{2}. $$ We also investigate a related problem of Erd\u0151s concerning a local difference condition. A finite set $ A \\subset \\mathbb{R} $ is called a $(4,5)$-set if every $4$-element subset of $A$ determines at least five distinct values among its six pairwise absolute differences. Erd\u0151s asked for the optimal constant $ c_* > 0 $ such that every $(4,5)$-set of size $ n $ contains a Sidon subset of size at least $ c_* n $. Gy\u00e1rf\u00e1s and Lehel reduced this to an extremal problem of $3$-uniform hypergraphs and proved $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{141 \\cdot 76} \\le c_* \\le \\frac{3}{5}$. We improve both bounds by establishing $$ \\frac{9}{17} \\le c_* \\le \\frac{4}{7}, $$ where the lower bound uses a reformulation of the extremal problem, and the upper bound follows from an explicit construction together with a convenient characterization of $c_*$.",
